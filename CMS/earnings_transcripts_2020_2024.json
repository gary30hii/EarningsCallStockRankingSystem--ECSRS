The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct the question and answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through February. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple months as I transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated five-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. Well, simple to put on paper, its not even replicate. And that is what set apart. It starts the industry-leading commitment to the clean energy and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with the commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan is consistently ranked the top tier regulatory jurisdiction. But investment opportunity and a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focused on affordability is critical. So our customers can afford these investments. Now, I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we demonstrated our ability to consistently manage cost as it invested in the safety and reliability of our systems, while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top down, but from the bottom up. Its our 500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and it was built in partnership with our union over the last two decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story would allow us to deliver for customers and you, our investors. Our adjusted EPS growth of 68% combined with our dividend provide the premium to all shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results year-in and year-out, 2020 prove this, 2021 will be no different. In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieve operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by a penny to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. Today, we're also increasing our five-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan, 18th consecutive years of industry leading financial performance. I'll let that sit with you for a moment. I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balanced everything we do for our co-workers, customers, and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors as demonstrated on slide six. 2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Through it all, I am proud of the work done by our co-workers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low income assistance, donations to foundations, and reinvestment to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness, as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Despite changing our work practices as a result of a pandemic, we maintain first portal employee engagement, achieved first portal customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with it significant investment in over 4000 new jobs. From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new winds and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. And last, but certainly not least, we finished the year with more than $100 million in cost savings driven by the CE WAY. Many of you have asked about my commitment to the CE WAY. A light blue arrow at the bottom on the slide and my experience, leading this operating system over the past five years should be a strong signal. I'll tell you this. We are positioned well. But there is still more opportunity. Through the CE WAY, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service. And that just a tip of the iceberg. There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE WAY. My coworkers and I remain committed. We will continue to lead the clean energy transition with support from our new five-year $13.2 billion capital investment plan was translates to over 7% annual rate base growth and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net zero carbon and methane emissions. In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition, and includes our renewable generation, electric distribution and investments to support this generation, grid monetization, as well as programs like our main invented service replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand and resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROEs. These incremental earnings mechanisms enhance our earned returns, and combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customer's ability to afford the investments in our system is complemented by our continued focus on cost savings. Over the last decade, we have reduced that utility bill as a percentage of the customer's wallet. And we continue to see further opportunity to reduce costs in the future. We had unique cost saving opportunities relative to peers and to above market PPAs, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power supply cost recovery in savings. This, coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities provides over $200 million savings for our customers. These structural cost savings combined with the productivity we'll deliver through the CE WAY will ensure we deliver on our capital plan and keep customer bills affordable. Now the great thing, the great thing about the CE WAY is it delivers more than cost savings. What makes us unique is our engaged coworkers. We value our best in sector employee engagement. And our 8500 coworkers work every day to deliver the best value for our customers. This engaged workforce has doubled productivity, which has enabled us to consistently increase our capital plan without significantly increasing our workforce. Furthermore, we have never served our customers better as we've moved from the bottom quartile to top quartile, not just in the utility industry, but across all industries. Slide nine serves as an excellent of how our team leverage the CE WAY to deliver on our triple bottom line. Our ability to deliver this level of excellence for our customers and investors is supported by Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We benefit from a legislative and regulatory construct that supports our rate case proceeding and the statute that allows financial incentives above and beyond Karn authorized ROE. Michigan's regulatory jurisdiction has been ranked in the top tier since 2013. That's not by accident. It's a reflection of the hard work my coworkers do every day to earn the trust of our customers, policymakers, environmental groups and the MPSC staff. We are proud to have a commission that demonstrates strong leadership with diverse backgrounds, which was enhanced with the appointment of Commissioner Paratek. We welcome Commissioner Paratek and look forward to working with her in the future. Turning to slide 11. You know we have a light regulatory docket with no financially significant regulatory outcomes in 2021. With the approval of our Karn securitization and electric rate case in December of last year, we'll file our next electric rate case in the first quarter and our gas rate case in December of this year. Notably, we'll follow set iteration of our integrated resource plan in June. I'm sure many of you would like a sneak peek, but its too early. We're in the midst of the modeling phase. You can be confident that this next iteration will continue to build on industry-leading clean energy commitments. And we'll find ways to get cleaner, faster and incorporate storage and customer driven solutions as they become more cost effective. Beyond that, we'll ask you to stay tuned until our second quarter earnings call. We will provide more information after we filed. I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2019 actuals. Now briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items previously discussed in our third quarter earnings call and enumerated in this morning's releases. To elaborate on the key drivers of our year-end results we released -- we realized increases in rate relief, net investments due to constructive orders and our recent gas and electric rate cases, strong performance in our non utility segments, and most notably, our historic company-wide cost reduction efforts led by the CE WAY, which Garrick noted earlier. These positive factors were partially offset by mild weather and reinvestment were flex up back into the business. We've talked in the past about our practice of flexing up, which enables us to put financial upside to work in the second half of the year, to pull ahead or commit to work to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, to fund customer support programs, which was particularly important in 2020, given the effects of the pandemic, invest in coworker training programs, and de risk our financial plan in subsequent years. This tried and true approach benefits all stakeholders which is the essence of the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. On slide 13 you'll not that we meet our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive with Garrick's earlier remarks, I'll just note that we invested $2.3 billion of capital in our electric and gas infrastructure to benefit customer's including investments in wind farms, which add approximately $500 million of RPS related rate base, which I'll remind you earns a premium return on equity of 10.7%. I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year, successfully raising approximately $3.5 billion of cost effective capital, which include roughly $250 million of equity while navigating turbulent capital market conditions over the course of 2020. These efforts further strengthen our balance sheet to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning the page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth offer 2020 actuals. Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be driven by the utility. And I'll also note a modest level of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in 2021, largely due to the absence of select non-operating flex items execute in 2020. All-in, we will continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range of 7% at year end, which is in excess of the sector average. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve for our 2021 EPS guidance range. As you'll note in the waterfall chart on slide 15, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share, a positive year-over-year variants given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate $0.41 of the EPS pickup in 2021 attributable to rate relief, net investment costs, largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a condition of our 2019 settlement agreement. While we do plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, as Garrick mentioned, that test year and economic impacts for that case will commence in 2022. As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of negative variance attributable to incremental O&M approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonisation. Needless to say, we have underlying assumptions around productivity and waste elimination, driven by the CE WAY, and we'll always endeavor to overachieve on those targets, while delivering substantial value for our customers. Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other items. And I'll note that while the pandemic remains relatively uncontained, we're assuming a gradual return of weather normalized load to pre-pandemic levels around mid year. In the event the mass teleworking trend persists and/or we see an accelerated reopening of the Michigan economy, we could potentially see some upside from incremental residential and commercial margin. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term given widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal energy and/or environmental policy. And our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it our job to do the warrant for you. Our EPS charge on slide 16 illustrates one of our key strength, which is to identify and eliminate financial risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerged to deliver additional benefits to customers, while sustaining our financial success over the long term for investors. Each year provides a different fact pattern and we've always risen to the occasion. 2020 offered some unique challenges resulting from the pandemic, and more familiar sources of risk in the form of mild winter weather. And as usual, we didn't make excuses. Instead, we offer transparency, devise our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8500 coworkers to deliver for our customers, the communities we serve, and for you, our investors. To summarize our financial objectives in the near and long term, we expect 6% to 8%, adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. From the balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to line better with the various rating agency methodologies. Given the increase in our five-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And two additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page, but no less important, or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and cared for in our purpose driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. To conclude my prepared remarks on slide 18, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis remains simple, but unique. It enables us to deliver for all our stakeholders, year-in and year-out. We remain committed to lead the clean energy transition, excellence through the CE WAY and delivering a premium total shareholder return through continued capital investment. The benefits that triple bottom line. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Gary. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Just one -- thanks. Just wanted to start off I guess on renewables CapEx deployment. Seems like that stepped up a little bit there. And just wondering I guess your appetite or your vision of how you see that could progress over time? And just want to clarify as well specifically on slide 22. When you talk about the clean energy generation there, how much of that is regulated versus non-regulated spend? Thanks\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thanks for your question. Let's just talk broadly about the renewables and the likes. So first of all, we have industry-leading commitments. And I want to be clear about that is one of the best in the industry out there. And so it's aggressive plan from a build out perspective. In our current integrated resource plan, we have 1.1 gigawatts of solar, that is part of the build out with a broader plan of six gigawatts of solar. And then, in the course of this integrated resource plan is Rev 2, which we'll file in June, we'll continue to advance our aggressive plans and our leadership in the clean energy transition. And so what you're picking up in our capital plan an additional $1 billion, you're right on the mark, Jeremy, there's more renewables to the tune about $200 million of additional solar and renewables in that plan. There's 200 million of hydro. And that might be surprising for some, but that's the original renewable, that's carbon free. And if you think about our Ludington Pumped storage facility, which is the largest, fourth largest in the in the world, it provides an important role in intermittency. There's 300 million for electric reliability can improve service out there, but also prepare the grid for the future. And then the balance is made up of investments in our gas system to further decarbonize. And so those are the important pieces. When we think about our -- on slide 22, specifically, and the investments there. Right now, our integrated resource plan is a 50/50 split between purchase power agreement and build, own, transfer. Now, because there are -- our renewable energy plan commitments, and we're building that wind to support that, so it's greater than 50/50. But let's talk about the 50/50 for a minute. All those PPAs, we are one of the few in the industry, and certainly leader in the industry to get a financial compensation mechanism associated with that. And the rest come through build, own, transfer. Now, as we think about our second IRP, we're going to take a strong look at what that mix looks like. And so that will be for the future. And so that will be something we explore and grow and certainly will be part of our integrated resource plan for the future. Now, I'm go to pass it over to Rejji too, because I know he has some additional thoughts to offer on this as well.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick. Jeremy, the only thing I would offer in addition to Garrick's good comments. And I don't know if this is an additional part of your question. But all of the capital spend that we have highlighted on this call, so the $13.2 billion and the $2.4 billion of clean energy at generation we see on 22 -- on page 22. This is all for the regulated utility consumers energy. So all of the capital investment we're talking about is earmarked for the regulated utility.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. Thank you for clarifying that. And just want to turn to the balance sheet a little bit there, I guess, that see the equity, you talked about stepped up a little bit there on up to 250. And just wondering if you might be able provide more color, if that kind of ratable across years? Or if that could be kind of more or less in a given year. And there's really the driver there just kind of step up in CapEx this year? Or any other color you could provide there would be great?\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy. I say, starting with the second part of your question first, it really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by a $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so, because of the capital plan and as utility increased by a $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan as you know, it's about $150 million per year run rate. And now we're at $250 million. Now, when you think about that distribution over the next five years, well, we may be opportunistic, and some years, it may be around $250, some years little less, we'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency. And we'll look at the price to stock, obviously. And I will just add. The first $250 million that we're planning to do in 2021, we've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table affords [ph] we executed in the back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. So I wouldn't say it's going to be a clean $250 each year, but that's the target. And then, some years a little more, some years will less. And so when I say a little more, up to $250 to ceiling and maybe in some years be less than that, just to be very clear.\nJeremy Tonet: That's super helpful. I'll stop there. Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning and congrats on this [Indiscernible]. It's actually Constantine here for Shahriar.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Constantine.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Just a quick one on kind of the clean energy mix for CMS. You've outlined some reductions in kind of coal and rate base and Campbell's obviously still a decade away. Without kind of jumping into the IRP, obviously, can you kind of talk about kind of the opportunity to move the retirements ahead? And any thresholds that you kind of envision for kind of moving those dates around, especially as replacement economics start to improve for that power?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thanks for your question. We're in the process of our integrated resource plan, I call it 2.0 or Rev 2, looking at that, and so right now -- and maybe even take a step back. Over the course of my career, we had 12 coal plants, we're down to our remaining five, Karn 1 and Karn 2, IRP 1.0 retirement of 2023. And right now, in this IRP, for 2.0, we're looking at the potential for early acceleration, early retirement for Campbell 1 and 2. Right now, their date is 2031, and evaluating whether that pulls forward or not. And so, that modeling is underway. there are a number of things we look at in that modeling. We're looking at the reliability of the grid, looking at the impact of coworkers obviously benefit the plan, but also the balance sheet. And what's the remaining book value, securitisation impact, and how does that play on the credit metrics? And what is the capital build out? There's a variety of variables that go into that. But that is certainly something that's under consideration. Also, we put that in the context of what's going on with the Biden administration and some of the ambitions around that from the plan perspective, which we support. And so that also factors into our thinking on our coal plants.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. That's very good color. And just shifting a little bit to kind of planning assumptions and low growth. So you -- and 2020 was obviously a little bit of a volatile year, just in terms of kind of shifts in the mix. And in your plan kind of Rejji mentioned that you're kind of going back to normal by the end of 2021. Do you anticipate kind of residential load trends that play out similar to kind of how they have been, and in general, they're being a little bit higher. And how does that impact kind the need for in flex, and then 2021, as you're starting the recovery, the kind of reset to the to the baseline, or their more return to normal and then profile by the tail end of the year?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I start off with the big picture, which is slide 16. And every year, when there's work to do, we get after it, and we flex our CE WAY muscle and find savings opportunities, and then we reinvest it. And so, again, we've positioned well for 2021. That's the broad message, I mean, specifically from a sales perspective. Residential sales, as we talked in Q3, and still here in Q4 are a bit sticky, as people are working from home, and many schools are still virtual. But as we see this pandemic playing out, we anticipate that those will decline, as you might expect as people go back to the traditional workplace. And as kids return to school. Also, we expect the commercial sales to grow a little bit. Restaurants have been opened up here recently, some limited capacity, but those will continue to grow, particularly as vaccines is more readily available and distributed across Michigan. And so, again, there's not aggressive assumptions in there. It's very conservative assumptions, as you might expect from us, and really returning to some pre-pandemic levels, just as we shared. From an O&M flex perspective, as I shared earlier, we feel like we're well positioned for 2021. We've done a lot of reinvestment for our customers at the end of the year toward to the tune of $0.18, that only helps our customers and provides benefit, but it de risks 2021. Now, the weather could be mild in the winter, it could be a cool summer and there's still pandemic out there, but rest assured what we do each and every year is we don't reset, we don't carve out. We get after it and we flex that CE WAY muscle and deliver. And so, no matter what the year throw at us, I'm prepared, we're prepared as a team, and I'm confident in the guidance we've provided.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Garrick. That was wonderful. I'll jump back in queue.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi, good morning, guys.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey. Just thinking about the IRP filings come up. Does the $250 million of equity already contemplate sort of the range of possible things that you've thinking of in that filing? Or should we expect to see some changes to that equity needs as a result of the plan?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Michael, this is Rejji. I'll just say that the equity issuance means that we have laid out our reflective of $13.2 billion capital plan. And then had some IRP-related capital investments, with I think, is remember, we're still executing on the first tranche of the 1.1 gigawatts of solar that were provided and the IRP that was approved in June of 19. And so there's some of that into the outer years of this plan. And so that's what that equity will support. We have not been too speculative as to what will come out of IRP, we have 2.0, and we'll see where the outcomes take us. But remember, it's a 10-month, potentially 12-month process. So if we file in mid 2021, as planned, we'll get an outcome around mid 2022. And that's a three-year board approval. So, my sense is, you'll see more of the results of that reflected in the next vintage of our five-year plan, which will roll out obviously in Q1 of next year. So for now, we're comfortable with a $250 million per year of equity funding this $13.2 billion plan.\nMichael Weinstein: Makes sense. And it's an approval that comes out of this three years, right? Is there -- could you comment a little bit about the appetite in Michigan, or the legality in Michigan of a multi year type settlement for rates, the coincide with an IRP of three years? And I'm just wondering if there's any possibility there? And also the appetite of the company flag kind of thing. I know that in the past, you guys have been very happy with the way the annual rate case. Just wondering what the prospects are for something like that?\nGarrick Rochow: We're still -- our approach is still to go with an annual rate case approach for a couple of reasons. One, as we work our CE WAY and we find opportunities for savings, it provides opportunity to give that back to our customers. And that creates headroom, which allows for our aggressive capital investment plans. And so that's the strategy that works for us. It works for our commission, continue on that path for some time.\nMichael Weinstein: Right. There's nothing legally. It's not legally blocking that type of outcome, though, right? I mean, it allowed Michigan to have a multi year plan?\nGarrick Rochow: No. There's nothing legally that's blocking it. And we've explored it at times. And again, we feel this is the best option for our strategy, the annual rate case.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. Thank you very much. That's all I got.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for the opportunity. And congrats, Garrick. I wanted to follow up here on the question on the IRP and weaving that into the CapEx update here. And I know, listen, we're pretty early on, but I wanted to understand, clearly, if you look at the slide, your -- shall we say, remaining large coal plant on Campbell, you've already shifted a little bit some of the timeline here. Would you say that next year, we could get an update on the five-year plan? Obviously, there's one larger plant that's out there, it's got a pretty long dated retirement. Is there a chance that we could see that in the five-year window? And could that impact the five year CapEx? I just want to clarify. And then also, can you clarify, I know you guys are raising CapEx here on clean energy, I just want to make sure that does not contemplate anything about any IRP outcomes to be extra clear about that?\nGarrick Rochow: Julien, thanks for your question. I think it's going to feel like a little bit of a reiteration for me on this answer, but we got an aggressive plan. It's net zero by 2040. And, obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2, as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the 2035. And even our Governor's goals within the State of Michigan, we're also considering what does that mean, and what does that look like? And so right now, Campbell 3 at 2039. And so, we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean, in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does this storage come in? How do we feed into that in over time. Because if we go too fast in this, there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan it counts on that last 8%. It counts on technology in terms of carbon -- capturing carbon sequestration they makeup with the balance. And so, important part of this is making sure that we also not only be carbonized, but we ensure affordability, and we ensure the reliability on both affordability. And I think we can answer all three. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so, when it comes to the Biden administration not only with CMS but our industry will pushing for more R&D and more technology advancements, to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which frankly we support from a planet perspective. And I'll offer than in terms of plan. And I know Rejji had some thoughts on this too. So Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Julien, the only thing I add is, there are two old things. Or a couple of old things with respect to the CMS story over time, and they both through CE WAY and Garrick, but they still are true to this day one. We plan conservative and no big bets. And so, in this plan, we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0. And so that's not flowing through this 2021 through 2025 plan. And in fact the components as Garrick highlights really, you got little bit, call it, just south of $400 million of RPS related spend that's just still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making. About a $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just add another year. And then Ludington on the hydro side, which Garrick again mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking, and tackling. Again, we do not swing for the fences when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly executable.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: got excellent. Maybe Rejji, if I can stick with you super quick. Clarify this from your earlier comments and apologies, I misheard. What the order of magnitude or the range that's associated with the residential sales?\nRejji Hayes: We have a sensitivities, Julien, as you know, on slide 18, if memory serves me. And so you can see what incremental residential would look like. And we've shown an annual basis. And it changes a little bit each year with regulatory outcomes. But a 1% change in the context of 2021 is worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And we're assuming fairly conservatively, as Garrick mentioned, that we'll get pretty close to pre pandemic residential around mid year. And so we're showing just year over year, little bit of a decline in residential again, ticking back to pre pandemic levels. So if we're -- if there's a percent -- if there's surprised to the upside to the tune of a percent, that's worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And I'll let your modeling assumptions go where they will, but that's generally the sensitivity.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right? Okay. Excellent. So 1% is kind of the order of magnitude and sensitivity.\nRejji Hayes: Well, no. To be clear, that's the sensitivity. I wouldn't offer any ceiling for you as to where that could go. Because as we said in the past, the mass teleworking trend that may not -- I don't think that's going to be a fad. I think a number of companies have said very publicly, and we've heard also offline anecdotally that a number of companies are going to sustain some level of mass teleworking going forward. Now again, we plan conservatively. So we're assuming you have that traditional negative correlation whereas C&I comes back, you start to see residential come back down as to regard to the workforce, but there's a good chance that we could see. Who knows 1%, 2% of upside. So again, I don't want to cap you. I just want to give you the sensitivity there.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thank you, Garrick. Best of luck guys.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question today, comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey. Good morning team. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one tactical one real quick. Rejji, just can you clarify. You mentioned some rating agency adjustments to FFO order bet. What exactly are those? And, I mean, I guess, is it the presentation change or what you were trying to convey there?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Sure, Durgesh. So as you know, both Moody's and S&P and Fitch, sorry, not both, but all three rating agencies have tailored computations as it pertains to FFO to debt. So, for example, now Moody's ascribed to different level of equity credit for hybrids we've been issuing those. S&P adds PPAs as parts of debt, Moody's includes securitization. So they all have their sort of bespoke ways in which they calculate FFO to debt. And so what we're trying to highlight in our current guidance is that we're trying to show those tailored computation so that we can maintain a solid investment grade credit rating. That we've historically targeting. So that kind of takes you to a mid teens level. I think historically, just to keep it simple, we've shown it on unadjusted basis, which gets you closer to the high-teens. But we wanted to reflect the reality of what those tailored computations will lead you to. And so that's what we're effectively doing.\nDurgesh Chopra: I see. Okay. So its no change to the absolute forecast number. It just the adjustments, all the credit rating agencies make and you sort of want to show that as relative to the bar? Or sort of the metric that hold you accountable too?\nGarrick Rochow: That's exactly right. So our philosophy has not changed at all. We want to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings and we think that mid-teens that afforded debt level again, I'll be tailored for rating agency should to stay there.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. Okay. Thank you. Then just maybe just quick one for you, Garrick. And maybe not so quick, but just coming out of the EICO [ph] meeting I didn't get a chance to catch up with you. But just any thoughts that you can share yours or other industry leaders on the legislation front. What come down from the Biden administration. What might had look like? What might the timeline look like? Just any color there would be appreciated?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thanks for your question, Durgesh. So I had the opportunity to listen two industry events, separate industry event, John Kerry, who is part of the Biden administration and for the climate envoy, as well as the Gina McCarthy, is also part of the Biden administration here engage in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Granholm and now likely lead at the Department of Energy here shortly. So it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from and net zero perspective for all sectors by 2025, I mean, 2050, and for the electric sector by 2035, from a net zero perspective. And, John Kerry was specific to say that it was an all in approach. And that also these ambitious -- these ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward. And then he also offered the thought. This was not a regulatory approach, because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so, I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we stood at 2040 to 2035, we can do that. But again, the important piece, really from an industry perspective is that we maintain the affordability, reliability, and decarbonization, all three of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that when we develop the technology, but it also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece. And we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that. Thanks for your question.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. Thank you. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Weisel: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First question on the O&Ms. So the $100 million or so that you identified in 2020 was extremely impressive. Now that the year is closed, how are you thinking about that in terms of sustainability of that $100 million? As a follow up in the waterfall on page 15, can you just take a little further into the negative $0.27 of higher costs, as far as how much of that is built into the new rates, and how much is what I would call your typical annual CE WAY cost savings?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So from a from $100 million challenge in our work, they're very successful, really over $100 million, very successful year, about 50% of that I put in the category of sustainable. So let me talk about kind of the both buckets. And so obviously, there's been some just changing the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We will go back and we'll do those things right, as part of the business. But through the CE WAY we've done 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. I want to give you an example. And this is a longer term one. But there was also a value that was seen here in 2020. So if I go back to 2015, we still have about 6 million calls in our call center, our contact center. In 2017 here, or I'm in 2020 here we did 2.7 million calls, drop a 3 million calls over that time period, you know, it's roughly $3 a call. And so I'll just give you one real example of the work and it speaks to the empowerment. What is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing in and put in their credit card information. That's a subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so, as you imagine a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect that goes over to our call center. So that's just one example of how we've improved the process, made it better for our customers, made it better for our coworkers. And then the cost falls out of that. And that's small. But imagine, multiplying that by 8500 people that are doing that type, because they're empowered, that's the unique piece. And so that's pay, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers. That's the type of cost savings opportunities, I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered on hundreds, and they will continue to live on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from the CE WAY. Now to your question, we were very successful in the midst of a pandemic. And I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020, and electric rate case. And so, as we look at for test years, and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that's for improved customer service. We increase, and it was, awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December, our forestry work, or tree trimming work which is the number one cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. And so that's already recovered. And we're going forward with that work to improve customer service, for all our customers. That's just one example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture perspective, there's more opportunity, we continue to improve the way we do business, excellent to the CE WAY.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Then one on the heating season and bills, obviously, gas prices are up, you've got this bad economy? Can you give us an update on what you're seeing from customers in terms of their ability to pay their bills? And I'm sure it's always a concern, but how does it compare now versus in past seasons? And maybe if you could dig a little deeper into some of the programs that you've got to help your -- to help support the customers in need?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. This has been one of our biggest years in support for our customer. So let me talk about the numbers. So when I look at current to 30 days, right now, our customer -- 87% of our customers are in that bucket, in current 30 days. That compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of from historical receivables to 30 days. And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we've worked closely with the commissioners and made sure that one, we didn't have a mandatory moratorium shut offs. It's been a voluntary. We work closely with Commission to do that. We put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as foundation help, specifically $15 million in 2020. We put another $24 million into our foundation, which is also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so, we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week. And we're looking at how can we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. And so there are a variety of ways we've helped out those particularly in need during this time. And we will continue through particularly around Michigan, because we are in the midst of this pandemic. But I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring both from a COVID perspective, but also Michigan's economy perspective. One, we got great distribution of the vaccine. And if you look at our numbers, the State of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back to school. That's already underway. But I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan. I sit on two economic development boards, 126 megawatts of new load, $2.5 billion of investment for 4000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. If I look back in the last three to four years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan, Kalamazoo Michigan, this is where they manufacturing the vaccine of Pfizer. That place is going gangbusters. And all the industries that support that are going gangbusters. Many people paint us as the automotive state. We truly have an automotive background, which is risk rich. But we're one of the leading states in the growth of life sciences, like we see at Pfizer and other place. And so, although we're in the midst of a pandemic, and they're certainly we need to be sensitive about those that are low income and are working through that, and we're doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers in the growth that I've seen here over the last four or five years.\nAndrew Weisel: Alright. That sounds great. If I could squeeze one last on just to confirm. You roll forward the five-year CapEx. But the 10-year plan of $25 billion with three to four upside that's just a reiteration, right? That's not meant to be a roll forward. Am I right? That won't be updated until after the IRP is done in a year and a half or so?\nGarrick Rochow: That's correct. It's $25 billion with $3 billion to $4 billion opportunity. And if there's events that warrant it we'll make adjustments.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Thank you. Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: When you look at the rate case outcome from last year, what are some of the pluses and minuses that you saw in the winds or losses that you might want to address in the next. I know you're not going to need any specifics, but general pluses and minuses that you may want to address next year or this year rather?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, one thing I spoke to the forestry outcome, that's going to be an great improvement. And again, the number one cause of outages in our state is tree trimming. And so that's a big, big lift. We've done a lot of great work on electric capital. And we made a great case and received a good portion of our electric capital investments that will prepare the grid for the future from a renewable perspective, as well as also improve reliability on the electric grid. We got some good outcomes in a distributed generation. And our approach to that which reduces the subsidy that is paid from our customers. In furthermore, we haven't spoke much about electric vehicles, but our powerMIFleet, which is where I think there's a great opportunity in electric vehicles, that's a space where we got approval for. And so -- and there's a whole host of other positives that would offer in there. From an opportunity perspective, we do see this as an opportunity perspective. We can do more work to justify our capital plans, particularly from a facilities perspective and a fleet perspective. We're a little short of our expectations there. And that's an area where we can build out better business cases and get better outcomes. I also think there's a better opportunity to have our commission not go look at historical five-year IT, because when IT and what we invest in that work, with how fast that is changing, when you do a historical, look, it doesn't provide the right amount of O&M you need. And so, there's more work we need to do with our staff, with the staff at the MPSC and with the commission to make a better case for O&M related to IT investments. And so those are a couple examples of things that we need to strengthen. And I'll pass it over Rejji. I know Rejji has some thoughts as well.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Travis. The only thing I would add to Garrick's good comments is that, we did see any electric rate case modest degradation in equity thickness. And so, when you take into account the deferred tax go back. Its only about 40 basis point of rate making equity thickness reductions. So modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still now two, three years, beyond tax reform, and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness, it create some to offset the effects of that. And so, again, to Garrick's point, the onus is on us to continue to make the compelling case that equity thickness at work should stay where it is today, but ideally accrete some time we've seen other jurisdictions do that. So we'll try to make that case better in subsequent cases.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That's, that's great. Appreciate that. And then real quick, you mentioned the EV program. We're thinking about a scale, let's say EV sales doubled over the assumptions that are in that -- in your program. What kind of CapEx does that mean? Is it minimal? Is a lot kind of think about that scale on the EV?\nGarrick Rochow: So what I'd offer, and I mean, this is really a preliminary piece here. We have nice scalable programs on the fleet side and the residential side that are continue to grow as electric vehicle grows. And I'd put up a level out there about 150 just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this fleet. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case, because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That'll be a big difference and how this moves. Because some of these fleets when you have to expand by two to three to four megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. And so, depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable, I'm figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, it was about a week and a half ago, there's a inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for some of your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point, right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more. And we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case. And we'll see more on that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. And Rejji, go ahead on that one, and we got more to add.\nRejji Hayes: The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the power Michigan drive program that we put in place. An element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge. And ideally charging off peak to get better utilization out of the existing assets. And there are economic incentive that were trying provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side to charge during peak periods. Well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs, that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak. And so, even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. That's very helpful. I appreciate all the thoughts.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks for your question, Travis.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nDavid Fishman: Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me here.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks David.\nDavid Fishman: So we've talked a little bit about the renewable on the electric side. But I'm just curious little bit for more color on the net zero methane by 2030 on the natural gas kind of size of business how CMS needs to invest to achieve that kind of rapid level decarbonization on the gas side? Is that seems kind of like over the past three years to five-year plans more or less been around $5 billion. Now little bit more this time than the 10-year plans around $10 billion with little bit upside. But is that the run rate you needs in order to get to reach net zero by 2030 with some RNG mixed in. Or is it something else that maybe we should be looking for that might lead to accelerating reduction in methane over time whether in the first five or next five years?\nGarrick Rochow: I love this question, David. Next week and this coming week and I should say, the next couple day, its going to be zero and negative one and one here in Michigan. And I have electric key pump at home. And I'll tell you what. It does not keep up. And so, I've got a supplement with gas to be able to keep my house warm. And in fact 75% of Michigan's resident count on natural gas. And so I'm so glad you ask that question. Because I think its really important when we think decarbonization, we're thinking not only about the electric but the gas business. And that's exactly what we're doing. And so, we do have a 10-year plan, as you pointed out to get to net zero by 2030. These investments which are represented in our five-year plan, and those in our 10-year, which will have the opportunity to grow, as we move forward, are exactly what delivers that net zero. We invest in taking out old metal and old materials out there, we replace it with plastic across our distribution system, which provides for safety that is so critical in our gas business. And we continue to maintain reliability, affordability, and decarbonization, because you can do all across that. Also, within that plan, you add a little bit of renewable natural gas, we have some on our system, we're going to add a little bit more renewable, natural gas that'll help to decarbonize that stream. That will get us to net zero methane by 2030. I'll tell you what, there's more opportunity to decarbonized natural gas. We've got energy efficiency programs that we have ran for 10 plus years, which are great. It's a win for our customers, saves them money. We get an incentive on it. It helps the plant all the above win win win. We have the ability to expand those programs on our gas business. And you can think about the technology in home envelope equipment. And we spent a lot. I won't go through them all now because I'm getting away from your questions. But yes, that investments spin right there. And we have a little bit more opportunity in future cases will we even there will deliver a net-net thing 2030 target.\nDavid Fishman: Got it. Thank you very helpful. And just one quick follow up on that one. So the RNG that you'd be adding into the system that just mostly be tariff based, right? You would just pretty much be taking RNG sources that are kind of separately owned and maybe adding an additional charge associated with the RNG kind of whenever it's just the customers? Or how would that work with the ownership and kind of supply dynamic?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So we'd like to put it on our system and have it be part of our gas supply cost recovery efforts there. And that'll be work we'll do. We've got some on our system, but as we add more we'll look at different opportunities. I think there's opportunities to think about individual customers who have a specific renewable natural gas need as part of their sustainability targets. And so I think there's customer programs we would consider as well.\nDavid Fishman: Yes. And then just one more quick if I can on regulation. I think it's part of the last electric rate case, the MPSC had mentioned looking at performance based metrics for performance based rate making I know, obviously, you have some relate to renewables right now. But I was just curious what you think that the commission is looking for there, and maybe you just had any color on what performance based ratemaking could look like in the future in Michigan?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. The work that you're referencing that in the Michigan power grid. There are a number of activities and actions are looking at everything from interconnections to what it means to achieve net zero by 2050, that's our Governor's goal is the carbon neutrality by 2050. And so there are a variety of things that they're taking a look at. And so it's not -- part of it is performance based ratemaking. But I would offer this to our commission and staff continue to be very thoughtful in their approach. And for example, some of it is just frankly, updating. One of the things that's part of our performance metrics we already have in place, is average speed of answer. That's a call center metric. Most of our communications and most of our activity as I shared with you earlier are digital in nature. And so to measure average speed of answer in today's time period, it's not really relevant. And so part of this too, is a thoughtful updating wells to and getting the land around those. And so, again, it's still in development. That's currently where we are, and I believe our commission and regulatory construct will continue to be thoughtful in that approach.\nDavid Fishman: And I guess, just with that example, the idea would be potentially every rate case or every set of rate cases, maybe you'd have kind of a target for average speed of answer as a metric. And you just be gauged against that, and you might have an incentive or penalty associated with that?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, we already have average speed of answer. That's already a performance metric, which we work with and we measure our performance too and work with staff and the commission on. And so, right now, it's really too soon to tell. I mean, this power grid work and the work that's going on is -- there's a lot of avenues of this and it's just -- there's more groups that are underway. We simply don't know what it looks like from a performance based rate making perspective.\nDavid Fishman: Okay. Thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Congrats on a great here.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hey, good morning, guys. How you doing?\nGarrick Rochow: I'm doing well, Paul. Thank you.\nPaul Patterson: So some really quick book emptier. On Interbank and I apologize that I missed this. The $0.02 increase in the fourth quarter. Was there anything in particular there that happened?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Paul, this is Rejji. Now they just kind of story throughout 2020 of them just executing and delivering. So loan origination volumes are often we saw that basically, after that brief pause for March and April origination slowed down a little bit in the nascent stages of pandemic, but then they just executed and delivered throughout the year. So that's what's reflected in that$0.02 uptick.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. And then on slide eight. So there's estimated cost savings. I just wanted to touch base on what they sort of represent. So I can see with Karn and Campbell, it's adjusted O&M savings. But I don't -- I'm not really clear on policies and I'm just wondering also since securitization of like $126 million, I think that was estimated by the Commission. And I wanted to sort of get a sense as to why those aren't being included, if you know what I mean?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. I can take those. So with respect to the PPA related savings. To give you the quick answer both Palisades and MCV, when you look at energy and capacity, they're both priced around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. And so, we looked at that relative to replacement costs. And so for palisade specifically, that is worth about $90 million run rate per year. MCV is a bit more nuanced. That's more just the fact that the capacity price embedded in the contract steps down, post 2025. It effectively cuts in half, and that's worth about $50 million. So that's the essence of the savings there for those two. Now, with respect to securitization, I just want to make sure I understand the spirit of where you're going. Is that with respect to when we tried to terminate Palisades early a few years ago, or 126, I just want to make sure what you're referencing there?\nPaul Patterson: Well, there was a securitization order for about $680 -- $690 million or something where you guys got in December. And I think $126 million was basically -- was what they basically saw was -- was what they basically thought was the savings that they called out as being the savings in it. I guess, I'm wondering is, it seems like they might maybe some stuff in the coal as well, that you guys aren't adding in there. And I'm just wondering why you're not calling those out?\nRejji Hayes: Are you going? Okay, so you're correct about the December securitization order of about $608 million to be very clear, that was specifically related to Karn 1 and 2. And so what we've enumerated on page eight are the O&M related savings that we have quantified. There could be additional savings above and beyond that we have good experiences, you know, closing cold facilities. So we obviously did the Classic Seven and 2016. And based on that history, that's what we've come up with a 30 million, if there are additional savings potential in the fuel side or otherwise, we'll obviously realize that upside to the benefit of costumers and investors, but for now, we're just reflecting the O&M savings at Karn 1 and 2. And the securitization order that we got in December solely related to that closure.\nPaul Patterson: Are these annual numbers or\u2026?\nRejji Hayes: These are run rate. So we don't anticipate these being just one time or episodic. I mean, the events themselves are episodic, but we expect these to be ongoing.\nPaul Patterson: And so just observe the flow on this. It looks like this, maybe considerably more savings that you guys might be getting from this. I mean, this seems conservative, these cold savings that you're that you're bringing up, I mean, so that obviously will go back to customers. But am I correct in that?\nRejji Hayes: Well, a couple things. So we always plan conservative for sure. And remember, this is just related to these events. So the Palisades retirement, the Karn facilities, the Campbell 1 and 2 potential in 2031, as well as MCV. This excludes all the CE WAY related savings. So $200 million is not the extent of our ambitions. That is solely the quantification of these amounts that are enumerated in the slide. We certainly think we can do more. And if there are additional savings within these items enumerated on page eight, we'll realize them where we come when they arrive. But again, you know our style, we are very conservative and how we go about our business. And we'd rather, I'll say deliver and surprise to the upside than the downside.\nPaul Patterson: Awesome. Thanks so much, guys.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Sophie Karp with Keybanc. Please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. So most of the questions have been answered. I guess, I don't want to beat the dead horse on equity and so on. But just maybe if I made a quick follow up on pensions. You mentioned that the plans fully funded. I think the market action helped that a lot in 2020. How does -- how do you contemplate the I guess, the potential contributions over the next five years during the grant period? And how does that factor into your equity needs and just general budget? Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, Sophie. Appreciate the question. And I thank you for the opportunity for us to really promote our activities over the last, not just last year, but a couple of years where similar to our mindset around flexing up on the income statement side. We also choose to flex up on the operating cash flow side. And last year, we saw pretty good upside largely driven by cost performance, a little bit from the Cares Act that allowed us to have some upside on OCF. And so we took the liberty to put about $700 million to work in discretionary pension contributions, most of which were in January of last year, but we did a good portion late in Q4. And that's allowed us to fully fund the pension. And so where we sit today, we don't anticipate certainly not any -- we certainly don't anticipate any involuntary contributions. And I think if there are any embedded in the five-year plan, I would say, they're relatively de minimis. And so, where we sit today, we think there should be really like contribution requirements over the next five years. And then, clearly there are variables. So if you're seeing discount rates come down. If you see asset performance underwhelmed or under performed that could require additional contributions. So where we sit today, we feel good about the lack, where limited amount of contributions over the courses five-year plan. So there's no real material impact embedded in our equity issuance assumptions. But again, these variables toggle and we have recalibrate every year. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like over the next couple of year. Is that that helpful.\nSophie Karp: Yes. Its super helpful. Thank you. And then, one last one if I may squeeze it in, but very quick. Your OCF guidance is down versus 2019 -- 2020 not by loss but like about $120 million, $130 million I would say. So, is the rate where you got most recently during the COVID kind of situation is primary driver of that? Or is it something else that I'm missing here?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So let me offer this, just to be very clear, Sophie. So, what we have done and this precedes me and Garrick. It's just been a long standing standard we've had from an financial planning perspective for OCF is, we have not unlike on the income statement an EPS. We have not guided OCF off of the prior year actuals. We have just looked at the budget or the guidance we provided from prior year. And we said, directionally we'll increase by $100 million each year off the prior year's guidance. And so, for example, last year we guided to $1.75 billion, obviously we delivered well in excess of that. And then this year again, a $100 million above and beyond that $125 billion. So yes, that is down from what actuals were, which was just under $2 billion. And again, a lot of that has to do with the cost performance as well as against some CARES Act related benefit. And so, I wouldn't view that as conservatism or just any type of rate or regulatory related actions that you just touched again just thinking about annual growth that we can deliver from an OCF perspective. But we're seeing all in over the next five years. We're going to do over $10 billion of operation cash flow generation and that is in excess of what we were anticipating over five years from the prior vintage which I thing itself is $10 billion or around $10 billion. So we feel good about our ability to deliver. On operating cash flow and its not a result of any of the regulatory outcomes. I think the only think you'll see in the gas settlement is about $30 million, $35 million of operating cash flow challenge, because we're staying out. But again its relative de minimis in the grand scheme of things.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Thank you. Very helpful. Appreciate it.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to Garrick Rochow for any final remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks Rocco. And I'd like to thanks everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I'll be back out on a virtual role shortly. And I look forward to connecting with you. I'm hoping we can meet face-to-face safely before the years over. Take care and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report our 2020 adjusted net income of $764 million or $2.67 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2019 actuals. Now briefly note that our adjusted EPS excludes select non-recurring items previously discussed in our third quarter earnings call and enumerated in this morning's releases. To elaborate on the key drivers of our year-end results we released -- we realized increases in rate relief, net investments due to constructive orders and our recent gas and electric rate cases, strong performance in our non utility segments, and most notably, our historic company-wide cost reduction efforts led by the CE WAY, which Garrick noted earlier. These positive factors were partially offset by mild weather and reinvestment were flex up back into the business. We've talked in the past about our practice of flexing up, which enables us to put financial upside to work in the second half of the year, to pull ahead or commit to work to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems, to fund customer support programs, which was particularly important in 2020, given the effects of the pandemic, invest in coworker training programs, and de risk our financial plan in subsequent years. This tried and true approach benefits all stakeholders which is the essence of the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. On slide 13 you'll not that we meet our key financial objectives for the year. To avoid being repetitive with Garrick's earlier remarks, I'll just note that we invested $2.3 billion of capital in our electric and gas infrastructure to benefit customer's including investments in wind farms, which add approximately $500 million of RPS related rate base, which I'll remind you earns a premium return on equity of 10.7%. I'll also note that our treasury team had a banner year, successfully raising approximately $3.5 billion of cost effective capital, which include roughly $250 million of equity while navigating turbulent capital market conditions over the course of 2020. These efforts further strengthen our balance sheet to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning the page to 2021. As mentioned, we are raising our 2021 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.83 to $2.87 per share, which implies 6% to 8% annual growth offer 2020 actuals. Unsurprisingly, the majority of our growth will be driven by the utility. And I'll also note a modest level of anticipated upside at the parent and other segment in 2021, largely due to the absence of select non-operating flex items execute in 2020. All-in, we will continue to target the midpoint of our consolidated EPS growth range of 7% at year end, which is in excess of the sector average. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve for our 2021 EPS guidance range. As you'll note in the waterfall chart on slide 15, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.06 per share, a positive year-over-year variants given the mild winter weather experienced in 2020. Additionally, we anticipate $0.41 of the EPS pickup in 2021 attributable to rate relief, net investment costs, largely driven by the orders received in the second half of 2020. It is also worth noting that the magnitude of EPS impact here is in part due to the absence of an electric rate increase in 2020, which was a condition of our 2019 settlement agreement. While we do plan to file an electric case in Q1 of this year, as Garrick mentioned, that test year and economic impacts for that case will commence in 2022. As we look at our cost structure in 2021, you'll note approximately $0.27 per share of negative variance attributable to incremental O&M approved in our recent rate cases to support key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonisation. Needless to say, we have underlying assumptions around productivity and waste elimination, driven by the CE WAY, and we'll always endeavor to overachieve on those targets, while delivering substantial value for our customers. Lastly, we apply our usual conservative assumptions around sales, financings and other items. And I'll note that while the pandemic remains relatively uncontained, we're assuming a gradual return of weather normalized load to pre-pandemic levels around mid year. In the event the mass teleworking trend persists and/or we see an accelerated reopening of the Michigan economy, we could potentially see some upside from incremental residential and commercial margin. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risks and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term given widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal energy and/or environmental policy. And our answer remains the same. Irrespective of the circumstances, we view it our job to do the warrant for you. Our EPS charge on slide 16 illustrates one of our key strength, which is to identify and eliminate financial risk and capitalize on opportunities as they emerged to deliver additional benefits to customers, while sustaining our financial success over the long term for investors. Each year provides a different fact pattern and we've always risen to the occasion. 2020 offered some unique challenges resulting from the pandemic, and more familiar sources of risk in the form of mild winter weather. And as usual, we didn't make excuses. Instead, we offer transparency, devise our course of action and counted on the perennial will of our 8500 coworkers to deliver for our customers, the communities we serve, and for you, our investors. To summarize our financial objectives in the near and long term, we expect 6% to 8%, adjusted EPS and dividend growth and strong operating cash flow generation. From the balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll manage the key credit metrics accordingly. One item I'll note in this regard is that we have slightly modified our FFO to debt targets to line better with the various rating agency methodologies. Given the increase in our five-year capital plan, we anticipate annual equity needs of up to $250 million in 2021 and beyond, which we are confident that we can comfortably raise through our equity dribble program to minimize pricing risk. And two additional items I'll mention with respect to our financial strength as we kick off 2021 that are not on the page, but no less important, or that we concluded 2020 with $1.6 billion of net liquidity, which positions our balance sheet well as we execute our updated capital plan going forward. And we have fully funded benefit plans for the second year in a row due to proactive funding, the latter of which benefits roughly 3,000 of our active coworkers and 8,000 of our retirees. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and cared for in our purpose driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. To conclude my prepared remarks on slide 18, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions, rate orders already in place and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimized. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for some final comments before Q&A. Thank you, Garrick. Jeremy, the only thing I would offer in addition to Garrick's good comments. And I don't know if this is an additional part of your question. But all of the capital spend that we have highlighted on this call, so the $13.2 billion and the $2.4 billion of clean energy at generation we see on 22 -- on page 22. This is all for the regulated utility consumers energy. So all of the capital investment we're talking about is earmarked for the regulated utility. Jeremy. I say, starting with the second part of your question first, it really is a ratable increase with the capital investment plan, which obviously has increased by a $1 billion vintage over vintage. And so, because of the capital plan and as utility increased by a $1 billion, we've had the equity needs increase roughly commensurate with that. And so the prior plan as you know, it's about $150 million per year run rate. And now we're at $250 million. Now, when you think about that distribution over the next five years, well, we may be opportunistic, and some years, it may be around $250, some years little less, we'll look at where the market is and how receptive it is to our currency. And we'll look at the price to stock, obviously. And I will just add. The first $250 million that we're planning to do in 2021, we've already taken about 20% of that pricing risk off the table affords [ph] we executed in the back half of 2020. And so we'll be opportunistic. So I wouldn't say it's going to be a clean $250 each year, but that's the target. And then, some years a little more, some years will less. And so when I say a little more, up to $250 to ceiling and maybe in some years be less than that, just to be very clear. Thanks. Yes, Michael, this is Rejji. I'll just say that the equity issuance means that we have laid out our reflective of $13.2 billion capital plan. And then had some IRP-related capital investments, with I think, is remember, we're still executing on the first tranche of the 1.1 gigawatts of solar that were provided and the IRP that was approved in June of 19. And so there's some of that into the outer years of this plan. And so that's what that equity will support. We have not been too speculative as to what will come out of IRP, we have 2.0, and we'll see where the outcomes take us. But remember, it's a 10-month, potentially 12-month process. So if we file in mid 2021, as planned, we'll get an outcome around mid 2022. And that's a three-year board approval. So, my sense is, you'll see more of the results of that reflected in the next vintage of our five-year plan, which will roll out obviously in Q1 of next year. So for now, we're comfortable with a $250 million per year of equity funding this $13.2 billion plan. Yes. Julien, the only thing I add is, there are two old things. Or a couple of old things with respect to the CMS story over time, and they both through CE WAY and Garrick, but they still are true to this day one. We plan conservative and no big bets. And so, in this plan, we've rolled out, we have not made any major presumptions around what will be an IRP 2.0. And so that's not flowing through this 2021 through 2025 plan. And in fact the components as Garrick highlights really, you got little bit, call it, just south of $400 million of RPS related spend that's just still taking through for some of the wind investments that we're making. About a $1.5 billion related to the IRP. And again, it's just execution on the solar, just add another year. And then Ludington on the hydro side, which Garrick again mentioned earlier. So this is all just incremental blocking, and tackling. Again, we do not swing for the fences when it comes to financial planning. And when it comes to regulatory approaches, we just do not make big bets. So it's a very conservative plan, and we think it's highly executable. We have a sensitivities, Julien, as you know, on slide 18, if memory serves me. And so you can see what incremental residential would look like. And we've shown an annual basis. And it changes a little bit each year with regulatory outcomes. But a 1% change in the context of 2021 is worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And we're assuming fairly conservatively, as Garrick mentioned, that we'll get pretty close to pre pandemic residential around mid year. And so we're showing just year over year, little bit of a decline in residential again, ticking back to pre pandemic levels. So if we're -- if there's a percent -- if there's surprised to the upside to the tune of a percent, that's worth about $0.04 per share on an annualized basis. And I'll let your modeling assumptions go where they will, but that's generally the sensitivity. Well, no. To be clear, that's the sensitivity. I wouldn't offer any ceiling for you as to where that could go. Because as we said in the past, the mass teleworking trend that may not -- I don't think that's going to be a fad. I think a number of companies have said very publicly, and we've heard also offline anecdotally that a number of companies are going to sustain some level of mass teleworking going forward. Now again, we plan conservatively. So we're assuming you have that traditional negative correlation whereas C&I comes back, you start to see residential come back down as to regard to the workforce, but there's a good chance that we could see. Who knows 1%, 2% of upside. So again, I don't want to cap you. I just want to give you the sensitivity there. Thanks. Yes. Sure, Durgesh. So as you know, both Moody's and S&P and Fitch, sorry, not both, but all three rating agencies have tailored computations as it pertains to FFO to debt. So, for example, now Moody's ascribed to different level of equity credit for hybrids we've been issuing those. S&P adds PPAs as parts of debt, Moody's includes securitization. So they all have their sort of bespoke ways in which they calculate FFO to debt. And so what we're trying to highlight in our current guidance is that we're trying to show those tailored computation so that we can maintain a solid investment grade credit rating. That we've historically targeting. So that kind of takes you to a mid teens level. I think historically, just to keep it simple, we've shown it on unadjusted basis, which gets you closer to the high-teens. But we wanted to reflect the reality of what those tailored computations will lead you to. And so that's what we're effectively doing. Yes. So from a from $100 million challenge in our work, they're very successful, really over $100 million, very successful year, about 50% of that I put in the category of sustainable. So let me talk about kind of the both buckets. And so obviously, there's been some just changing the way we do business this year. We're not flying places. We will go back and we'll do those things right, as part of the business. But through the CE WAY we've done 50% of it is clearly sustainable. And there are a number of actions that we've taken, which will continue to provide savings for our customers and create headroom as we go forward. I want to give you an example. And this is a longer term one. But there was also a value that was seen here in 2020. So if I go back to 2015, we still have about 6 million calls in our call center, our contact center. In 2017 here, or I'm in 2020 here we did 2.7 million calls, drop a 3 million calls over that time period, you know, it's roughly $3 a call. And so I'll just give you one real example of the work and it speaks to the empowerment. What is unique is that we empower our coworkers to do this. And so some people still pay by calling in and dialing in and put in their credit card information. That's a subset of our customers. That team took that process, took 24 steps out of the process, moved it from 405 seconds to 305 seconds. And so, as you imagine a customer who wants to pay that way, the more steps they have, the longer it takes, the more they get frustrated, it turns into a defect that goes over to our call center. So that's just one example of how we've improved the process, made it better for our customers, made it better for our coworkers. And then the cost falls out of that. And that's small. But imagine, multiplying that by 8500 people that are doing that type, because they're empowered, that's the unique piece. And so that's pay, right? We're not going to go back and make that experience worse for our customers. That's the type of cost savings opportunities, I can go through hundreds of them. And in fact, we have delivered on hundreds, and they will continue to live on hundreds of them. And so that's how I think about it. And there's more opportunity across our company to deliver on excellence from the CE WAY. Now to your question, we were very successful in the midst of a pandemic. And I think it speaks to our regulatory construct and getting gas settlement in 2020, and electric rate case. And so, as we look at for test years, and we look at the work we're underway, we've got recovery in place. And so when you see that uptick in O&M, much of that's for improved customer service. We increase, and it was, awarded through the electric rate case outcome in December, our forestry work, or tree trimming work which is the number one cause of outages, we increased it by $30 million. And so that's already recovered. And we're going forward with that work to improve customer service, for all our customers. That's just one example of the increase that you note there. But again, big picture perspective, there's more opportunity, we continue to improve the way we do business, excellent to the CE WAY. Yes, Travis. The only thing I would add to Garrick's good comments is that, we did see any electric rate case modest degradation in equity thickness. And so, when you take into account the deferred tax go back. Its only about 40 basis point of rate making equity thickness reductions. So modest level of degradation. But at the end of the day, we're still now two, three years, beyond tax reform, and the balance sheet and cash flow generative effects of tax reform are very real. And so we would like to see that equity thickness, it create some to offset the effects of that. And so, again, to Garrick's point, the onus is on us to continue to make the compelling case that equity thickness at work should stay where it is today, but ideally accrete some time we've seen other jurisdictions do that. So we'll try to make that case better in subsequent cases. The only thing I would add is just -- it also just depends on customer or end user behavior at the end of the day as well. And so part of the power Michigan drive program that we put in place. An element of that is really to educate customers on when to charge. And ideally charging off peak to get better utilization out of the existing assets. And there are economic incentive that were trying provide as part of that. But if EV owners feel compelled, and this is more on the residential side to charge during peak periods. Well, that could have implications on the electric infrastructure as well as supply needs, that we may have, which would have a direct impact on capital. And so again, we've talked a lot about shaving the peak. And so, even though that may lead to additional capital investment opportunities, we think that's suboptimal in terms of where to put the best dollar longer term. And so I think a lot of this will also be dictated on EV owner behavior. Yes, Paul, this is Rejji. Now they just kind of story throughout 2020 of them just executing and delivering. So loan origination volumes are often we saw that basically, after that brief pause for March and April origination slowed down a little bit in the nascent stages of pandemic, but then they just executed and delivered throughout the year. So that's what's reflected in that$0.02 uptick. Are you going? Okay, so you're correct about the December securitization order of about $608 million to be very clear, that was specifically related to Karn 1 and 2. And so what we've enumerated on page eight are the O&M related savings that we have quantified. There could be additional savings above and beyond that we have good experiences, you know, closing cold facilities. So we obviously did the Classic Seven and 2016. And based on that history, that's what we've come up with a 30 million, if there are additional savings potential in the fuel side or otherwise, we'll obviously realize that upside to the benefit of costumers and investors, but for now, we're just reflecting the O&M savings at Karn 1 and 2. And the securitization order that we got in December solely related to that closure. These are run rate. So we don't anticipate these being just one time or episodic. I mean, the events themselves are episodic, but we expect these to be ongoing. Well, a couple things. So we always plan conservative for sure. And remember, this is just related to these events. So the Palisades retirement, the Karn facilities, the Campbell 1 and 2 potential in 2031, as well as MCV. This excludes all the CE WAY related savings. So $200 million is not the extent of our ambitions. That is solely the quantification of these amounts that are enumerated in the slide. We certainly think we can do more. And if there are additional savings within these items enumerated on page eight, we'll realize them where we come when they arrive. But again, you know our style, we are very conservative and how we go about our business. And we'd rather, I'll say deliver and surprise to the upside than the downside. Thank you. Yes. So let me offer this, just to be very clear, Sophie. So, what we have done and this precedes me and Garrick. It's just been a long standing standard we've had from an financial planning perspective for OCF is, we have not unlike on the income statement an EPS. We have not guided OCF off of the prior year actuals. We have just looked at the budget or the guidance we provided from prior year. And we said, directionally we'll increase by $100 million each year off the prior year's guidance. And so, for example, last year we guided to $1.75 billion, obviously we delivered well in excess of that. And then this year again, a $100 million above and beyond that $125 billion. So yes, that is down from what actuals were, which was just under $2 billion. And again, a lot of that has to do with the cost performance as well as against some CARES Act related benefit. And so, I wouldn't view that as conservatism or just any type of rate or regulatory related actions that you just touched again just thinking about annual growth that we can deliver from an OCF perspective. But we're seeing all in over the next five years. We're going to do over $10 billion of operation cash flow generation and that is in excess of what we were anticipating over five years from the prior vintage which I thing itself is $10 billion or around $10 billion. So we feel good about our ability to deliver. On operating cash flow and its not a result of any of the regulatory outcomes. I think the only think you'll see in the gas settlement is about $30 million, $35 million of operating cash flow challenge, because we're staying out. But again its relative de minimis in the grand scheme of things. Thank you."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today. I've had the pleasure of meeting many of you over the past couple months as I transitioned into the CEO role. I'm excited to be hosting my first earnings call and sharing yet another year of consistent industry-leading financial performance. Before I discuss our year-end results and our updated five-year capital investment plan, I want to take a moment to reiterate our simple but powerful investment thesis. Well, simple to put on paper, its not even replicate. And that is what set apart. It starts the industry-leading commitment to the clean energy and gas systems to achieve decarbonization. These investment opportunities are supported by constructive energy legislation as well as alignment with the commission and the MPSC staff. This strong regulatory and legislative framework is why Michigan is consistently ranked the top tier regulatory jurisdiction. But investment opportunity and a supportive regulatory environment are not enough. Our focused on affordability is critical. So our customers can afford these investments. Now, I've been with the company for 18 years, much of it in operations. Over that time, we demonstrated our ability to consistently manage cost as it invested in the safety and reliability of our systems, while improving customer service. That ability to manage cost is not driven from the top down, but from the bottom up. Its our 500 coworkers who are committed to excellence, delivering the highest value to our customers at the lowest cost possible. This is embedded in our culture and it was built in partnership with our union over the last two decades. These unique attributes to the CMS story would allow us to deliver for customers and you, our investors. Our adjusted EPS growth of 68% combined with our dividend provide the premium to all shareholder return of 9% to 11%. Our ability to deliver this growth each and every year is something we are uniquely capable of doing. Regardless of weather, a global pandemic, who's leading our state our commission or our company, we have delivered consistent industry-leading results year-in and year-out, 2020 prove this, 2021 will be no different. In 2020, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.67, up 7% from 2019 and achieve operating cash flow of almost $2 billion, excluding $700 million of voluntary pension contributions in 2020. Today, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2021 by a penny to $2.83 to $2.87, with a focus on the midpoint. This reflects annual growth of 6% to 8% from our 2020 results. Last month, we announced our 15th dividend increase in as many years, $1.74 per share, up 7% from the prior year. We continue to target long term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again, with a focus on the midpoint. Today, we're also increasing our five-year capital plan to $13.2 billion, up $1 billion from our prior plan, 18th consecutive years of industry leading financial performance. I'll let that sit with you for a moment. I'm pleased with our financial performance. But equally important is our commitment to the triple bottom line. We balanced everything we do for our co-workers, customers, and the communities we serve, our planet and our investors as demonstrated on slide six. 2020. 2020 was a tough year for everyone. The global pandemic impacted all of us emotionally, physically and financially. Through it all, I am proud of the work done by our co-workers. We were able to provide over $80 million of support to our customers and communities in 2020 through support programs, low income assistance, donations to foundations, and reinvestment to improve safety and reliability. We focused our efforts on COVID relief for residential and small business customers, payment forgiveness, as well as enhanced support in the area of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Despite changing our work practices as a result of a pandemic, we maintain first portal employee engagement, achieved first portal customer experience and attracted 126 megawatts of new load to our state, which brings with it significant investment in over 4000 new jobs. From a planet perspective, we continue to lead the clean energy transition. We added over 800 megawatts of new winds and are executing on 300 megawatts of new solar, the first tranche of our integrated resource plan. Further in our commitment, over $700 million of investments were made to advance our clean energy transition. Additionally, our demand response and energy efficiency programs continue to save our customers money, reduce carbon and earn an incentive. And last, but certainly not least, we finished the year with more than $100 million in cost savings driven by the CE WAY. Many of you have asked about my commitment to the CE WAY. A light blue arrow at the bottom on the slide and my experience, leading this operating system over the past five years should be a strong signal. I'll tell you this. We are positioned well. But there is still more opportunity. Through the CE WAY, we will continue to improve reliability, reduce waste and deliver better customer service. And that just a tip of the iceberg. There are opportunities in every corner of the company to achieve excellence through the CE WAY. My coworkers and I remain committed. We will continue to lead the clean energy transition with support from our new five-year $13.2 billion capital investment plan was translates to over 7% annual rate base growth and focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system as we move toward net zero carbon and methane emissions. In fact, 40% of our plan directly supports our clean energy transition, and includes our renewable generation, electric distribution and investments to support this generation, grid monetization, as well as programs like our main invented service replacement programs, which reduce methane emissions. In addition to our traditional rate base returns, our wind investments, renewable PPAs and demand and resources are supported by regulatory incentives above and beyond our ROEs. These incremental earnings mechanisms enhance our earned returns, and combined with our investments in clean energy, our growing percentage of our earnings mix. Our customer's ability to afford the investments in our system is complemented by our continued focus on cost savings. Over the last decade, we have reduced that utility bill as a percentage of the customer's wallet. And we continue to see further opportunity to reduce costs in the future. We had unique cost saving opportunities relative to peers and to above market PPAs, Palisades and MCV, which will generate nearly $140 million of power supply cost recovery in savings. This, coupled with the future retirement of our remaining coal facilities provides over $200 million savings for our customers. These structural cost savings combined with the productivity we'll deliver through the CE WAY will ensure we deliver on our capital plan and keep customer bills affordable. Now the great thing, the great thing about the CE WAY is it delivers more than cost savings. What makes us unique is our engaged coworkers. We value our best in sector employee engagement. And our 8500 coworkers work every day to deliver the best value for our customers. This engaged workforce has doubled productivity, which has enabled us to consistently increase our capital plan without significantly increasing our workforce. Furthermore, we have never served our customers better as we've moved from the bottom quartile to top quartile, not just in the utility industry, but across all industries. Slide nine serves as an excellent of how our team leverage the CE WAY to deliver on our triple bottom line. Our ability to deliver this level of excellence for our customers and investors is supported by Michigan's constructive regulatory environment. We benefit from a legislative and regulatory construct that supports our rate case proceeding and the statute that allows financial incentives above and beyond Karn authorized ROE. Michigan's regulatory jurisdiction has been ranked in the top tier since 2013. That's not by accident. It's a reflection of the hard work my coworkers do every day to earn the trust of our customers, policymakers, environmental groups and the MPSC staff. We are proud to have a commission that demonstrates strong leadership with diverse backgrounds, which was enhanced with the appointment of Commissioner Paratek. We welcome Commissioner Paratek and look forward to working with her in the future. Turning to slide 11. You know we have a light regulatory docket with no financially significant regulatory outcomes in 2021. With the approval of our Karn securitization and electric rate case in December of last year, we'll file our next electric rate case in the first quarter and our gas rate case in December of this year. Notably, we'll follow set iteration of our integrated resource plan in June. I'm sure many of you would like a sneak peek, but its too early. We're in the midst of the modeling phase. You can be confident that this next iteration will continue to build on industry-leading clean energy commitments. And we'll find ways to get cleaner, faster and incorporate storage and customer driven solutions as they become more cost effective. Beyond that, we'll ask you to stay tuned until our second quarter earnings call. We will provide more information after we filed. I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. Our investment thesis remains simple, but unique. It enables us to deliver for all our stakeholders, year-in and year-out. We remain committed to lead the clean energy transition, excellence through the CE WAY and delivering a premium total shareholder return through continued capital investment. The benefits that triple bottom line. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Good morning, Jeremy. Yes. Thanks for your question. Let's just talk broadly about the renewables and the likes. So first of all, we have industry-leading commitments. And I want to be clear about that is one of the best in the industry out there. And so it's aggressive plan from a build out perspective. In our current integrated resource plan, we have 1.1 gigawatts of solar, that is part of the build out with a broader plan of six gigawatts of solar. And then, in the course of this integrated resource plan is Rev 2, which we'll file in June, we'll continue to advance our aggressive plans and our leadership in the clean energy transition. And so what you're picking up in our capital plan an additional $1 billion, you're right on the mark, Jeremy, there's more renewables to the tune about $200 million of additional solar and renewables in that plan. There's 200 million of hydro. And that might be surprising for some, but that's the original renewable, that's carbon free. And if you think about our Ludington Pumped storage facility, which is the largest, fourth largest in the in the world, it provides an important role in intermittency. There's 300 million for electric reliability can improve service out there, but also prepare the grid for the future. And then the balance is made up of investments in our gas system to further decarbonize. And so those are the important pieces. When we think about our -- on slide 22, specifically, and the investments there. Right now, our integrated resource plan is a 50/50 split between purchase power agreement and build, own, transfer. Now, because there are -- our renewable energy plan commitments, and we're building that wind to support that, so it's greater than 50/50. But let's talk about the 50/50 for a minute. All those PPAs, we are one of the few in the industry, and certainly leader in the industry to get a financial compensation mechanism associated with that. And the rest come through build, own, transfer. Now, as we think about our second IRP, we're going to take a strong look at what that mix looks like. And so that will be for the future. And so that will be something we explore and grow and certainly will be part of our integrated resource plan for the future. Now, I'm go to pass it over to Rejji too, because I know he has some additional thoughts to offer on this as well. Hi, Constantine. Yes. Thanks for your question. We're in the process of our integrated resource plan, I call it 2.0 or Rev 2, looking at that, and so right now -- and maybe even take a step back. Over the course of my career, we had 12 coal plants, we're down to our remaining five, Karn 1 and Karn 2, IRP 1.0 retirement of 2023. And right now, in this IRP, for 2.0, we're looking at the potential for early acceleration, early retirement for Campbell 1 and 2. Right now, their date is 2031, and evaluating whether that pulls forward or not. And so, that modeling is underway. there are a number of things we look at in that modeling. We're looking at the reliability of the grid, looking at the impact of coworkers obviously benefit the plan, but also the balance sheet. And what's the remaining book value, securitisation impact, and how does that play on the credit metrics? And what is the capital build out? There's a variety of variables that go into that. But that is certainly something that's under consideration. Also, we put that in the context of what's going on with the Biden administration and some of the ambitions around that from the plan perspective, which we support. And so that also factors into our thinking on our coal plants. Well, I start off with the big picture, which is slide 16. And every year, when there's work to do, we get after it, and we flex our CE WAY muscle and find savings opportunities, and then we reinvest it. And so, again, we've positioned well for 2021. That's the broad message, I mean, specifically from a sales perspective. Residential sales, as we talked in Q3, and still here in Q4 are a bit sticky, as people are working from home, and many schools are still virtual. But as we see this pandemic playing out, we anticipate that those will decline, as you might expect as people go back to the traditional workplace. And as kids return to school. Also, we expect the commercial sales to grow a little bit. Restaurants have been opened up here recently, some limited capacity, but those will continue to grow, particularly as vaccines is more readily available and distributed across Michigan. And so, again, there's not aggressive assumptions in there. It's very conservative assumptions, as you might expect from us, and really returning to some pre-pandemic levels, just as we shared. From an O&M flex perspective, as I shared earlier, we feel like we're well positioned for 2021. We've done a lot of reinvestment for our customers at the end of the year toward to the tune of $0.18, that only helps our customers and provides benefit, but it de risks 2021. Now, the weather could be mild in the winter, it could be a cool summer and there's still pandemic out there, but rest assured what we do each and every year is we don't reset, we don't carve out. We get after it and we flex that CE WAY muscle and deliver. And so, no matter what the year throw at us, I'm prepared, we're prepared as a team, and I'm confident in the guidance we've provided. Hi, Michael. We're still -- our approach is still to go with an annual rate case approach for a couple of reasons. One, as we work our CE WAY and we find opportunities for savings, it provides opportunity to give that back to our customers. And that creates headroom, which allows for our aggressive capital investment plans. And so that's the strategy that works for us. It works for our commission, continue on that path for some time. No. There's nothing legally that's blocking it. And we've explored it at times. And again, we feel this is the best option for our strategy, the annual rate case. Julien, thanks for your question. I think it's going to feel like a little bit of a reiteration for me on this answer, but we got an aggressive plan. It's net zero by 2040. And, obviously, we're looking at the potential to accelerate part of that plan with Campbell 1 and 2, as part of this plan. But we're also in the broader context of the Biden administration in the 2035. And even our Governor's goals within the State of Michigan, we're also considering what does that mean, and what does that look like? And so right now, Campbell 3 at 2039. And so, we will continue to take a look at what it means for Campbell 3. But again, there's a ton of analysis that needs to go into this. I mean, in addition to what I shared earlier, we're looking at what is the cost of renewables out in the future. We want to feather in those renewables over time to take advantage of the cost as those cost come down. We want to take a look at storage. Right now, storage is not at the right price. And so how does this storage come in? How do we feed into that in over time. Because if we go too fast in this, there's going to be risk from a reliability perspective. And frankly, when you get out to the end part of that plan it counts on that last 8%. It counts on technology in terms of carbon -- capturing carbon sequestration they makeup with the balance. And so, important part of this is making sure that we also not only be carbonized, but we ensure affordability, and we ensure the reliability on both affordability. And I think we can answer all three. It's just that we have to pace it and allow technology. And so, when it comes to the Biden administration not only with CMS but our industry will pushing for more R&D and more technology advancements, to be able to have the aspirations and meet the aspirations that the new administration is putting out, which frankly we support from a planet perspective. And I'll offer than in terms of plan. And I know Rejji had some thoughts on this too. So Rejji. That's exactly right. So our philosophy has not changed at all. We want to maintain solid investment grade credit ratings and we think that mid-teens that afforded debt level again, I'll be tailored for rating agency should to stay there. Yes. Thanks for your question, Durgesh. So I had the opportunity to listen two industry events, separate industry event, John Kerry, who is part of the Biden administration and for the climate envoy, as well as the Gina McCarthy, is also part of the Biden administration here engage in the planet ambitions. Furthermore, our relationship with former Governor Granholm and now likely lead at the Department of Energy here shortly. So it gives us a good context around some of these emissions. And what we've heard clearly is from and net zero perspective for all sectors by 2025, I mean, 2050, and for the electric sector by 2035, from a net zero perspective. And, John Kerry was specific to say that it was an all in approach. And that also these ambitious -- these ambitious goals. But again, it was going to be about R&D type development and technology development to move it forward. And then he also offered the thought. This was not a regulatory approach, because that takes too long, and it would be incentives based on the market to spur and increase the market. And so, I believe we're well positioned for that. Again, where we stood at 2040 to 2035, we can do that. But again, the important piece, really from an industry perspective is that we maintain the affordability, reliability, and decarbonization, all three of those can be addressed. And it's going to require more R&D from a federal policy perspective. And so that when we develop the technology, but it also moves at scale, so we can get the economics of it for all our customers. And so that's an important piece. And we'll be leaning in from an industry perspective to shape that. Thanks for your question. Yes. This has been one of our biggest years in support for our customer. So let me talk about the numbers. So when I look at current to 30 days, right now, our customer -- 87% of our customers are in that bucket, in current 30 days. That compares with 2019, which was 88% in 2017 -- I'm sorry, 2018, which was 89%. And so there is an impact there. But as you see, it's pretty light in terms of what is kind of from historical receivables to 30 days. And so -- and really, we believe that's by design. One, we've worked closely with the commissioners and made sure that one, we didn't have a mandatory moratorium shut offs. It's been a voluntary. We work closely with Commission to do that. We put invested a number of dollars in both payment forgiveness as well as foundation help, specifically $15 million in 2020. We put another $24 million into our foundation, which is also started to provide some of that benefit in 2021. And so, we continue to increase that work. In fact, I was on the phone with the Attorney General's office this week. And we're looking at how can we work together on this issue to do even more in 2021. And so there are a variety of ways we've helped out those particularly in need during this time. And we will continue through particularly around Michigan, because we are in the midst of this pandemic. But I think there is a lot of bright things that are occurring both from a COVID perspective, but also Michigan's economy perspective. One, we got great distribution of the vaccine. And if you look at our numbers, the State of Michigan has improved in that performance. And so we've seen restaurants open. We've seen this movement of kids going back to school. That's already underway. But I even take a bigger picture perspective and look at some of the economic things that I've seen here in Michigan. I sit on two economic development boards, 126 megawatts of new load, $2.5 billion of investment for 4000 new jobs. That's not just a highlight from this year. If I look back in the last three to four years, it's been very similar to that. And if you go to a place like Kalamazoo, Michigan, Kalamazoo Michigan, this is where they manufacturing the vaccine of Pfizer. That place is going gangbusters. And all the industries that support that are going gangbusters. Many people paint us as the automotive state. We truly have an automotive background, which is risk rich. But we're one of the leading states in the growth of life sciences, like we see at Pfizer and other place. And so, although we're in the midst of a pandemic, and they're certainly we need to be sensitive about those that are low income and are working through that, and we're doing our efforts there. I'm also optimistic about what Michigan offers in the growth that I've seen here over the last four or five years. That's correct. It's $25 billion with $3 billion to $4 billion opportunity. And if there's events that warrant it we'll make adjustments. Good morning, Travis. Well, one thing I spoke to the forestry outcome, that's going to be an great improvement. And again, the number one cause of outages in our state is tree trimming. And so that's a big, big lift. We've done a lot of great work on electric capital. And we made a great case and received a good portion of our electric capital investments that will prepare the grid for the future from a renewable perspective, as well as also improve reliability on the electric grid. We got some good outcomes in a distributed generation. And our approach to that which reduces the subsidy that is paid from our customers. In furthermore, we haven't spoke much about electric vehicles, but our powerMIFleet, which is where I think there's a great opportunity in electric vehicles, that's a space where we got approval for. And so -- and there's a whole host of other positives that would offer in there. From an opportunity perspective, we do see this as an opportunity perspective. We can do more work to justify our capital plans, particularly from a facilities perspective and a fleet perspective. We're a little short of our expectations there. And that's an area where we can build out better business cases and get better outcomes. I also think there's a better opportunity to have our commission not go look at historical five-year IT, because when IT and what we invest in that work, with how fast that is changing, when you do a historical, look, it doesn't provide the right amount of O&M you need. And so, there's more work we need to do with our staff, with the staff at the MPSC and with the commission to make a better case for O&M related to IT investments. And so those are a couple examples of things that we need to strengthen. And I'll pass it over Rejji. I know Rejji has some thoughts as well. So what I'd offer, and I mean, this is really a preliminary piece here. We have nice scalable programs on the fleet side and the residential side that are continue to grow as electric vehicle grows. And I'd put up a level out there about 150 just as an early marker. And I think what is the important key about this fleet. And I'm really excited about what came out of the electric rate case, because we're going to offer a concierge service to help businesses make the choice. That'll be a big difference and how this moves. Because some of these fleets when you have to expand by two to three to four megawatts, you're talking about transformers and substations and other upgrades associated with that. And so, depending on the fleet mix is really -- it's an important variable, I'm figuring out what that capital build out looks like. As GM announced here, it was about a week and a half ago, there's a inflection point between when it makes sense to be an electric vehicle fleet for some of your trucking versus going to hydrogen. And I think that point, right there is an important point that we need to understand a bit more. And we're working to do that. And that's the importance of this fleet program we got in the last electric rate case. And we'll see more on that grow and be able to better pinpoint our capital investment opportunities. And Rejji, go ahead on that one, and we got more to add. Thanks for your question, Travis. Thanks David. I love this question, David. Next week and this coming week and I should say, the next couple day, its going to be zero and negative one and one here in Michigan. And I have electric key pump at home. And I'll tell you what. It does not keep up. And so, I've got a supplement with gas to be able to keep my house warm. And in fact 75% of Michigan's resident count on natural gas. And so I'm so glad you ask that question. Because I think its really important when we think decarbonization, we're thinking not only about the electric but the gas business. And that's exactly what we're doing. And so, we do have a 10-year plan, as you pointed out to get to net zero by 2030. These investments which are represented in our five-year plan, and those in our 10-year, which will have the opportunity to grow, as we move forward, are exactly what delivers that net zero. We invest in taking out old metal and old materials out there, we replace it with plastic across our distribution system, which provides for safety that is so critical in our gas business. And we continue to maintain reliability, affordability, and decarbonization, because you can do all across that. Also, within that plan, you add a little bit of renewable natural gas, we have some on our system, we're going to add a little bit more renewable, natural gas that'll help to decarbonize that stream. That will get us to net zero methane by 2030. I'll tell you what, there's more opportunity to decarbonized natural gas. We've got energy efficiency programs that we have ran for 10 plus years, which are great. It's a win for our customers, saves them money. We get an incentive on it. It helps the plant all the above win win win. We have the ability to expand those programs on our gas business. And you can think about the technology in home envelope equipment. And we spent a lot. I won't go through them all now because I'm getting away from your questions. But yes, that investments spin right there. And we have a little bit more opportunity in future cases will we even there will deliver a net-net thing 2030 target. Yes. So we'd like to put it on our system and have it be part of our gas supply cost recovery efforts there. And that'll be work we'll do. We've got some on our system, but as we add more we'll look at different opportunities. I think there's opportunities to think about individual customers who have a specific renewable natural gas need as part of their sustainability targets. And so I think there's customer programs we would consider as well. Yes. The work that you're referencing that in the Michigan power grid. There are a number of activities and actions are looking at everything from interconnections to what it means to achieve net zero by 2050, that's our Governor's goal is the carbon neutrality by 2050. And so there are a variety of things that they're taking a look at. And so it's not -- part of it is performance based ratemaking. But I would offer this to our commission and staff continue to be very thoughtful in their approach. And for example, some of it is just frankly, updating. One of the things that's part of our performance metrics we already have in place, is average speed of answer. That's a call center metric. Most of our communications and most of our activity as I shared with you earlier are digital in nature. And so to measure average speed of answer in today's time period, it's not really relevant. And so part of this too, is a thoughtful updating wells to and getting the land around those. And so, again, it's still in development. That's currently where we are, and I believe our commission and regulatory construct will continue to be thoughtful in that approach. Well, we already have average speed of answer. That's already a performance metric, which we work with and we measure our performance too and work with staff and the commission on. And so, right now, it's really too soon to tell. I mean, this power grid work and the work that's going on is -- there's a lot of avenues of this and it's just -- there's more groups that are underway. We simply don't know what it looks like from a performance based rate making perspective. Thank you. I'm doing well, Paul. Thank you. Yes. I can take those. So with respect to the PPA related savings. To give you the quick answer both Palisades and MCV, when you look at energy and capacity, they're both priced around $55 to $60 per megawatt hour. And so, we looked at that relative to replacement costs. And so for palisade specifically, that is worth about $90 million run rate per year. MCV is a bit more nuanced. That's more just the fact that the capacity price embedded in the contract steps down, post 2025. It effectively cuts in half, and that's worth about $50 million. So that's the essence of the savings there for those two. Now, with respect to securitization, I just want to make sure I understand the spirit of where you're going. Is that with respect to when we tried to terminate Palisades early a few years ago, or 126, I just want to make sure what you're referencing there? Yes, Sophie. Appreciate the question. And I thank you for the opportunity for us to really promote our activities over the last, not just last year, but a couple of years where similar to our mindset around flexing up on the income statement side. We also choose to flex up on the operating cash flow side. And last year, we saw pretty good upside largely driven by cost performance, a little bit from the Cares Act that allowed us to have some upside on OCF. And so we took the liberty to put about $700 million to work in discretionary pension contributions, most of which were in January of last year, but we did a good portion late in Q4. And that's allowed us to fully fund the pension. And so where we sit today, we don't anticipate certainly not any -- we certainly don't anticipate any involuntary contributions. And I think if there are any embedded in the five-year plan, I would say, they're relatively de minimis. And so, where we sit today, we think there should be really like contribution requirements over the next five years. And then, clearly there are variables. So if you're seeing discount rates come down. If you see asset performance underwhelmed or under performed that could require additional contributions. So where we sit today, we feel good about the lack, where limited amount of contributions over the courses five-year plan. So there's no real material impact embedded in our equity issuance assumptions. But again, these variables toggle and we have recalibrate every year. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like over the next couple of year. Is that that helpful. Thanks Rocco. And I'd like to thanks everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. I'll be back out on a virtual role shortly. And I look forward to connecting with you. I'm hoping we can meet face-to-face safely before the years over. Take care and be safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through November 5th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Sri, and good morning everyone. We hope you\u2019re all doing well and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. This morning I\u2019ll share our financial results and outlook for the first nine months of the year. I\u2019ll also introduce our 2021 guidance, review our catalogue plan which supports our de-carbonization efforts and I\u2019ll touch briefly on our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and as always we will call for Q&A. We\u2019re happy to report that for the first nine months of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.11, up 17% from the same period in 2019. Our year-to-date results were driven by our team\u2019s best-in-class cost management through the CE way. Given the risk mitigation in place for this year and our visibility into next year, we\u2019re pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint and introduce our adjusted guidance for 2021 of $2.82 to $2.86, up, you guessed it 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our current guidance range. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again with a bias to the midpoint, which I\u2019ll remind you reflects both consistent and industry leading growth. We remain grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom-line of people, planet and profit. We\u2019re committed to diversity, equity and inclusion and are doubling our spend on diversifiers over the next five years after having tripled our spend over the last seven. Just last month, the Governor of Michigan announced the State\u2019s goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 which supports our clean energy plan and all the actions we\u2019ve already taken to protect our planet and reduce our carbon footprint. And before moving on, I want to highlight we\u2019re over $100 million in cost reductions realized year-to-date through the CE way. This is a true testament to the maturity of our CE way mindset and just what this team is capable of when called to action. My quick story of the month is from our team at Filer City generating station, who identified a shorter route throughout the building to perform operator rounds. This eliminated over one hour or 2,500 steps on each shift. The annual mileage savings are equivalent to the distance from the southern border of our state all the way to Mackinac Bridge. Now that\u2019s [indiscernible] about. Step-by-step, minute-by-minute, dollar-by-dollar it all heads up to the CE way. Our team has proven that we can put the pedal to the medal on cost performance to deliver the required results now and in the future. Our commitment to the triple bottom-line chime through in our capital investment plan that focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system while keeping customer bills affordable, protecting our planet and delivering for our customers and investors as we move toward net zero. We benefit from a regulatory constructed Michigan and a statue that allows for the financial incentives above and beyond our current authorized ROE. These include a 20% return on our energy efficiency spend as we help customers reduce energy waste and lower their monthly bills. A financial mechanism equal to our weighted average cost of capital on new renewable PPAs and a premium ROE of 10.7% on renewable investments to meet our 15% renewable portfolio standard in Michigan. All of which illustrates that we can deliver reliably on the triple bottom-line what\u2019s good for our people and the planet can also deliver top tier profits. It\u2019s no wonder we\u2019re considered a leader in ESG. By 2024, we will have added 1,100 megawatts of solar to our system on top of 1 gigawatt of RPS renewables since 2011. Our clean energy plan calls for a total of 6 gigawatts of solar additions to our system or $3 billion to $6 billion of investment opportunities through 2040. As we move forward and file our next IRP in 2021, we will look to realize some of this opportunity and pulled into our plan as utility scale renewables continue to make triple bottom-line sense. Our commitment to serving all our stakeholders has not gone unnoticed. We\u2019ve been recognized nationwide for our good efforts and slide 7 celebrates that recognition, including that as of 2019, CMS Energy received an MSCI ESG rating of AA. Moving onto our regulatory calendar. We settled our gas rate case last month and agreed not to file another gas rate case before December of 2021. We expect an order in our electric rate case and an outcome on our securitization filing by the end of this year. Following that we will not have any general rate case decisions impacting our 2021 earnings which provide further visibility and economic certainty throughout next year. Turning to my favorite slide, slide 9 reminds you of how we manage the work intra year to mitigate risk in future years and deliver the financial results you\u2019ve come to expect. So in a year like this year when we\u2019ve seen an enormous amount of headwinds, our team hunkered down and exercised our lean operations to find and eliminate waste at every level. To-date we\u2019ve realized over a $100 million in saving through these efforts and I\u2019m so very proud of all my co-workers for demonstrating world-class cost performance and enabling us to deliver savings through the CE way so that we can continue to deliver a world-class customer experience and consistent industry leading financial performance. Now, you might be wondering if that $100 million of savings would make us deviate from our bias toward the midpoint of the guidance range. It does not. We\u2019re sitting in the driver seat as we put the pilot savings to work for 2021 and 2022 and begin to de-risk those years. It is precisely this cost discipline which rollercoaster for you and instead delivers the consistent top tier annual growth rate every year, not just the easy ones. 7% year after year after year. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success and the year after that. We ride the rollercoaster so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you expect. And now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. In the third quarter we delivered adjusted net income of $221 million which translates to $0.77 per share. Our third quarter results were $0.04 above our third quarter 2019 results largely due to cost performance, constructive regulatory outcomes and favorable weather at the utility. It is worth noting that our adjusted earnings for the quarter excludes non-recurring items primarily related to retention cost associated with the pending retirement of our current coal facilities which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date we\u2019ve delivered adjusted net income of $605 million or $2.11 per share, up 17% from the same period in 2019. As Patti noted, we\u2019re trending well in large part due to our company wide efforts in cost reduction largely driven by the CE way. As you know, we continue to monitor our electric sales and utility closely given that the pandemic is not yet fully contained and we remain encouraged with the trends we observed across each customer class over the course of 2020. On slide 11, you will see that weather normalized electric sales were up roughly half of a percent for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2019 with the residential segment continuing to lead the way up 6% for the quarter versus the comparable period in 2019. The commercial and industrial segments continue to recover down 4% and 3.5% respectively versus the prior year, which aligns well with the phase reopening of Michigan's economy. As noted in the past the weather normalized industrial and total electric sales I just quoted, exclude the effects of one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter in 2021, we're cautiously optimistic about the normalized trends we've seen so far in 2020 with normalized load for the residential segment continuing to outperform expectations, which I'll remind you offers a higher margin than those of our commercial industrial segments and has historically represented over 60% of our customer contribution. Turning to our waterfall chart on slide 12, you can see the current and expected drivers of our year-over-year financial performance. As mentioned, cost performance continues to be a key factor to our financial results for 2020 and as Patti noted we have delivered over $100 million of savings to date, the vast majority of which is represented in the $0.28 per share of cost savings highlighted in the table on the left hand side of the page and more than offsets the pandemic related expenses incurred to-date and mild weather experience in the first quarter. Rate relief net investments and less storm activity relative to the comparable period in 2019 provided $0.13 and $0.05 per share of positive variance respectively in the first nine months of the year. With three months to go in 2020, we'll plan for normal weather as we always do, which implies $0.02 per share of negative variance versus the prior year and is more than offset by the constructive outcome we achieved in our gas rate case settlement which equates to $0.07 per share of pickup in the fourth quarter. Needless to say we will remain paranoid by maintaining sufficient contingency to mitigate the inherent risk to our business such as weather and storms as well as a potential resurgence of virus in Michigan and will concurrently reinvest any estimated excess contingency to provide near and long-term value to our customers, co-workers and investors. As we look out longer term even with our significant success reducing costs in 2020 and in years prior there are still ample opportunities to reduce costs to create headroom in customer bills for future capital investments. As a reminder, the expiration of our large PPAs and the retirement of our coal fleet offer sustainable cost reduction opportunities over the next several years. We'll also realize capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems and will continue to reap the benefits of the ongoing maturation of the CE way. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right-hand side of slide 13, which highlights that we've kept customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan from 2007 to 2019 while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in our gas and electric systems over that timeframe. In fact, in 2019 our utility bills made up approximately 3% of household expenditures in Michigan, down a 4 percentage point from the 2007 level. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long-term given the widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal, energy and/or environmental policy. You name the risk and I can assure you we've heard it before. Well, the reality is that change is the one constant that you can count on in this business and we'll continue to adapt to the inherent risks and other external factors that may impact our business and still deliver for our customers, co-workers, the planet and our investors as we have for almost two decades now as illustrated on page 14. And with that I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Rejji. Simply this, our model holds together well and that's why this thesis remains strong. With that Rocco please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. \nPatricia Poppe: Good morning Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: I just want to start off, if you might be able to provide us some thoughts on what the next IRP filing could look like and any more color if you see opportunities to further accelerate coal retirement, integrate renewables more and include storage as part of the resource mix there?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes Jeremy, great question. We are excited about our next filing of IRP which will be made a year 2021. We're still in the modeling phase. So no early read just yet. So I will say we're hopeful that an outer years in particular in our first filing we had about 450 megawatts of storage. I would love to see more storage in the outer years. We were requested in our settlement and agreed to study earlier requirements of some of the other coal plants, but right now our plan remains the same, but certainly when we know will let you know and we're excited about the potential that new IRP and what it offers to benefit the planet and the cost structure and our customers. It's really a great time in this business.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. Thanks for that and then separately just wondering if you could provide a bit more detail on the benefit that a 6% uptick and residential sales has had on the electric margins and really just, with this increased residential skew and cost for mix and sales and the cost cuts you've achieved so far just wondering how we should think about that and how that might impact the upcoming rate filing?\nRejji Hayes: Yes Jeremy. We talked about in the past the impact that the residential segment has in our electric business and so the general \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about the annual impact is 1% change and residential equates to $0.03 of EPS accretion and that's symmetric so up or down. And for industrial and other side it's about half a penny for 1% change commercial rule close to residential. So it does have a pretty good impact and as you think about the road ahead I'll just remind you the electric case that we have pending that has a 4 test here which reflects all of 2021 and so we are contemplating a subsequent file of this electric rates case and so that will obviously have an impact on 2022. But if we continue to see a trend like we've seen over the course of this year, it could provide a potential tailwind in 2022, but we're still at obviously the early stages of our planning process for 2021. But I'd say the electric rate cases that\u2019s pending, the order on that will obviously dictate a lot of our economics going in 2021 in the existing gap settlement that we've already got provides a lot of economics going into 2021. Does that address your question?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, that's very helpful. Thanks for taking my question.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Jeremy. \nOperator: Next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse, please go ahead.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning Michael.\nOperator: Michael your line is on mute perhaps.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. Sorry about that. Here I am. Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on whether you might be considering some type of multiyear rate plan going forward. I know you have forward test years and annual rate cases have worked out well for company, especially in Michigan, which is pretty favorable state for investors. But has there been any consideration for some type of multiyear situation going forward?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Michael you make a really good point in fact that we do have forward-looking test gears. And so what we like about our annual filing is first of all, just because we file a rate case doesn't necessarily mean customers bills are going up and as Rejji described in his prepared remarks, we can do capital investment and this business model of ours where cost savings are passed along to customers has to occur in those proceedings. And so our annual filing provides us two what I think are big advantages particularly given the certainty of the regulatory environment here in Michigan. One that we have alignment with the commission before we spend it. So we have no risk post a rate order that will have disallowances. We have alignment on the work that we're going to do. We have alignment on the investments that we're going to make and so that is a real certainty going forward. But two, it also allows us to adjust the plan as conditions change and we can pass along the cost savings that the team achieves while we're adjusting those plans. So we can build the budget, we can build an operating plan that matches and agreed upon framework with the commission. And so I think that's good regulation. I think that's the right kind of transparency, the right kind of certainty and yet at the same time demonstrates agility as we move forward and conditions change around us. I do think it's in the best interest of our customers.\nMichael Weinstein: Great and also for The DIG plan, as you go forward with the by the Michigan Supreme Court, do you think you'll be trending more towards the upper end of that opportunity range of 3 to 750 going forward?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Exactly Michael in October 21, for example, we secured some contracts for planning year 24 and 25 and 25 and 26 at the $4.25 kilowatt month. We secured about 30 megawatts. So we're definitely seeing pick up that wasn't all the way at comp. But with the LCR, there's only all the few places within zone 7, which is Michigan's lower peninsula where an alternative energy supplier can secure that capacity and DIG is one of those places and so we've absolutely already seen a little bit of that upside. \nMichael Weinstein: Great and I guess that's about it for now. Thank you very much.\nPatricia Poppe: Great. Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Good morning guys.\nPatricia Poppe: Morning Shahr.\nShahriar Pourreza: Just couple of questions here. So just on equity you obviously had, you don't have any equity in 19 that was deferred to 2020. And then you've got 250 millions planned for this year. What is, can you remind us what is your new 21 guidance embed in terms of equity and how we think about sort of the perpetual need is it should be just assume around 150 million per year level set for 2020 excluding the 2019 that you deferred into 2020?\nRejji Hayes: Yes Shahr just to be clear, we haven't provided a point of view based on our latest modeling for equity needs in 21 and beyond but I think the working assumption that we provided as we rolled out our five-year plan in the first quarter of this year. We said 250 this year as you rightly note, and then we send run rate 150 per year that presuppose a $12.2 billion five year capital plan at the utility. And so as you know, we provide a new five-year look in Q1 and every year on our fourth quarter earnings call and so it will calibrate, will look at what the capital plan looks like from 21 through 25. And if that dictates additional equity needs then we will adjust accordingly, but I will say this, I feel very confident that this has been our general rule of thumb that we will be able to continue. We need to increase equity need to fill line of the capital plan. We should be able to continue to avoid block equity and really just be able to execute our equity needs to our dribble program, which I generally like to think is around 1.5% to 2% of our market cap. So we feel that the equity needs may change. We'll see what the math ends up in our 5-year plan, but I don't expect us to be issuing material amount equity every year going forward.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. And then just on the cost savings, you call that 100 million savings in 2020 actively being reinvested. How much of that is the first mortgage bonds and opportunistic refinancing year-to-date and how do we think about sort of that being one time versus sort of perpetual nature? I mean what types of things are you learning as you move past the crisis stage of COVID?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. It's a great question Shahr and so I think generally, we look at identify and realize cost savings are two classes. There are operating cost savings and non-operating cost savings. What we highlighted in our prepared remarks and this has been an ongoing theme over the course of this year as well in Q2. The vast majority of the savings realized to-date have been operating savings. There have been some not operating savings. So you probably saw in a waterfall slide that we had about 7% the benefits. Those are clearly non-operating and then Sri and the team and treasury have been really quite opportunistic in executing on a very attractively priced financing of the course this year. I can come back on the exact EPS amount. I think we had about a penny or two of upside this year and we do anticipate a good portion of that being ongoing and sustainable because the reality is if you price the bond below plan particularly with the recent plan you obviously have their savings over the life of the bond. And now obviously our debt financing needs will increase to fund capital and so you have some new money in there, but to refi those lower bond financing particular when we pull forward a bond maturities we have in the past those savings you should get it for several years.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it, perfect. And then just one last one for me on sort of the load growth obviously reported very healthy weather adjusted load numbers in the third quarter. Curious on what you're embedding in the guidance for 21. What are you assuming as far as COVID-related backdrop to keep kind of slightly alluded to it a little bit in the prepared? But are you assuming sort of V-shaped recovery, which is I think what a lot of your peers is saying or are you seeing sort of a more gradual pick up like what's kind of embedded in plan you touched a little bit on the contingency there but it seems like from what you're highlighting even if you see another protracted downturn or even a weakening in the residential market that you have enough lovers to offset sort of that headwind but I don't want to leave the witness ready. So you go.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So let me approach that in a couple of ways Shahr. So first there are I'll say the sales assumptions embeded in the pending election rate case which will capture all of fiscal year 2021 and so we're past the evidentiary phase. I don't want to pre-judge or foreshadow where the commission may end up. But I think clearly there is a change in the assumptions embedded in the rate case and then what we've observed over the course of 2020 and as we've talked about the last several quarters now we are seeing a favorable mix in the form of residential in excess of expectations and C&I I'll say slightly down. Now the variables which could lead to a tailwind in 2021, it's clearly residential. We've seen just this sustained level of residential non-weather uptick and I think it has a lot to do with remote working a number of companies have sustained that and we said we have a sense they may sustain it even post-pandemic and so that could provide a bit of a tailwind going into next year. And then the rate or pace at which C&I has recovered over the course this year has also been a little bit of surprise to the upside. And so going into the next year there's what's invented in the rate case and so there may be a little bit of upside there but then if you think about okay now that we're 10 months smarter since we filed our rate case what are we seeing and how do we think that compares to what we've seen over the course of 2020. And I'll say it's fair to assume that the pandemic started out in the kind of mid March timeframe in Michigan and we had the shelter in place in late March and so a lot of the effects of the pandemics are flowing through our 2020 forecast. And so when you think of the year-over-year comparison, I don't expect we'll see a material bump in residential versus what we've experienced so far in 2020 because again a lot of that's already reflected in our numbers but I do think C&I will see I think it could be flatish. I hate to put a letter to any type of shape of a recovery. I would say the Nike Swoosh seems to me to be the most applicable shape. I've also heard people talk about a K-shape because you will have some sectors that bounce back quickly and some that do not and so I hate the hazard to guess at this point. But I think it'll be a gradual recovery and a continued recovery for C&I. Again we've been surprised to be upset but pandemic has yet to be contained. So we'll obviously plan cautiously as we always do.\nShahriar Pourreza: Terrific. Thanks guys. Congrats again. \nPatricia Poppe: Thank you. \nRejji Hayes: Thank you Shahr.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nDurgesh Chopra: Hi good morning team. Two big picture questions, one election around the corner just can I get your thoughts the opportunities and risks the climate plan and a potential tax change I appreciate early but just any thoughts there?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. You bet just at the highest order as we have always said we work with everyone and so we're sure that America will sort out all of this election business. Now we know I think what to expect from Donald Trump and his administration and that's been working fine for us. If Joe Biden is elected and there's a stronger push for a clean energy transition or a carbon-free electric sector, we have a plan that's pretty aggressive already. We have a plan that gets to net zero by 2040. And so even when he says 2035 in kind of campaign ads the idea of it really being national at 2035 seems aggressive. But we could actually work to adapt. One thing we'd like to remind people about this is that as we make this clean energy transition and we've been very ambitious as you know we've retired seven of our 12 coal plants already reduced our carbon emissions by 40%. Our net zero plan for 2040 puts us again about a decade ahead of most in the industry and so given that we feel like there's a need for some technology advancements in those outer years and when those breakthroughs occur and as the cost of solar and potentially storage continues to decline we'll look forward to accelerating our plans. And we know that that can be good for both for our triple bottom-line people, planet and profit. So we're pretty agnostic on the outcome of the elections. We think there's our clean energy plan stands on its own. Rejji maybe you want to talk about some of the tax implications of Biden administration? \nRejji Hayes: I'd be happy to. So Durgesh as you know the Biden team has rolled out at least a preliminary look on fiscal policy and so what we've seen is a potential increase in the marginal tax rate from 21% to 28% and since federal tax reform is in the two distant past you may recall just sort of the puts and takes that we saw there and so I think conceptually you can anticipate that there may be a rate increase and that's obviously the inverse of what we saw when we went from a 35% tax rate down to 21% and so there would potentially be a rate increase and the commission in Michigan was very thoughtful and how they incorporated that into our filing process and I anticipate that they'll probably take a similar approach. And so obviously that will eat into headroom, but I think we've proven time and time again irrespective of the headwind we'll manage the cost to make sure that our customers bills stay at or below inflation. And so there will be a likely rate impact that you see an increase in tax rate. Now the upside is that there was cash flow and credit metric degradation on the heels of federal tax reform. So if you see a 7% increase in the marginal tax rate you should see a cash flow benefit as well as some credit metric accretion on the other side of that and that will presumably lower our funding costs and that too will offset some of the rate impact. So I think you'll see some pros and cons and it's almost the inverse of what we saw when we had federal tax reform in 17.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood guys. Thanks for all the color. One quick follow-up, just on strategy and long-term strategy so a couple transactions here year-to-date portfolio optimization companies kind of sort of streamlining the businesses, selling non-regulated businesses. Just your mostly latest thoughts on interbank and your other round regulated businesses how does it fit into your long-term value proposition? And then just flipping the coin and perhaps even opportunities for expansion given sort of the multiple you're trading at versus peers?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, great questions Durgesh. First of all the interbank team, shout out to that team they're performing well and benefiting from this year actually from the uptick in home improvement. I've heard in fact it's called investing and nesting and interbank is being participating in that. So that's been good, but really the bottom-line is this we're very content with our business mix where it is. And I just want to remind everyone that our utility is far and away the driver of our growth at CMS energy with 90% of our business mix and really so to that end there is really nothing new to share about our non-regulated businesses and we just, we manage them very much like we manage our utility business with consistency, high quality off-takers long-term contracts, leveraging our core competency, downside risk management, no big bets we like our mix.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent and just maybe any thoughts on potential expansion M&A?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, it just ends up not really being on the top of our list given our organic growth strategy. We've got ample CapEx to deploy. People ask us because of the CE way is that something you could deploy and maybe someday we would want to but that's a long time from now. We really, we have a solid five year capital, ten year capital plan and the next five years we have got real visibility to our ability to deliver growth and shareholder value.\nDurgesh Chopra: Appreciate the time Patty. Thanks so much. \nPatricia Poppe: You're welcome. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Arnold: Hi good morning guys. \nPatricia Poppe: Hey Jonathan. \nJonathan Arnold: Hi. Just a quick one on the $3 billion to $6 billion Patti that you called out and the renewables or it sort of sits on the on top of the 2040 bar on that slide. I am just curious how much of that is in the 10 year plan versus sort of in the subsequent years?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, great question. We have a billion dollars, actually $1.8 billion in renewables in the five-year plan and the 10-year plan we have a potential for additional maybe even up to $3 billion of total renewables in the 10-year plan and so when we think about the three to six think of 2040 that's another 10 years. But our solar deployments are front end loaded. We have of our 6,000 megawatts of solar we intend to deploy by 2040. 5,000 of it is by 2030. So that really makes up and that's already in our 10-year plan but we'll share more visibility to that when we update the capital plan at the year-end call.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. Thank you for that. And then just a little more high level you've been very clear that you're going to be using the outperformance you've had this year and the sales help to reinvest and not just in 2021, but also beyond. And so but I'm curious to why have a range on earnings growth and why not just target seven and then yes sort of secondary to that what could potentially push you to age in a given year seeing how you're handling this year for example?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes Jonathan. I will remind you that our six to eight are $0.04 range. So a single point we're practically a single point as it is. But we do think that this top tier 7% EPS growth for the sector is among the best and particularly when you factor in the consistency of it and I just think as a utility that you can count on for six to eight with a $0.04 range. The push to 8% it has a temporary benefit but we would prefer to have an annual take it home, take it to the bank, sleep at night we ride that straight, we ride that rollercoaster so you can plan on that straight line and so the idea of pushing it to eight what we've always said in fact when we first announced that we were going to six to eight years ago we said there might be a year that there were surprises to the upside. But what I want to be really clear about is that this year we have ample opportunity to redeploy those savings into protecting outer years and that's always our first priority. And so I don't want to mislead anyone and make them think there's going to be a sugar high in 2020. This is the perfect kind of year to plan for uncertainty we're heading into for 2021 and making sure that 22 can be delivered too. \nJonathan Arnold: We like that stability so thanks for the reminder. \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thank you Jonathan. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nStephen Byrd: Good morning.\nRejji Hayes: Good morning Steven.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning.\nStephen Byrd: Congrats on the continued strong execution. A lot of my questions have been addressed. I wanted to go back to the point about in the event that there is a democratic sweep and there's clean energy legislation and I just wanted to talk a little bit more about your resource mix. You have a resource plan as you mentioned coming up in mid-21 and if there was legislation that extended tax credits for wind and solar perhaps created a new tax credit for storage. Is it your sense that that would be enough to essentially sort of tip the scales further meaningfully in favor of renewables adoption more quickly and phasing out fossil fuels more quickly just given the magnitude? How do you kind of think about the sort of magnitude of impact of that kind of support on your kind of thinking on your resource plan?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes Stephen great question. A couple things. One I do think further tax incentives on storage would be beneficial. I think what's going to be more beneficial is the amount of R&D that's underway in storage. You and I have talked many times about the electric vehicles and all the research happening there on battery storage. Some of the research that's being done on hydrogen, both for fuel cells for vehicles but more importantly for us from a perspective of hydrogen as a fuel cell version of storage on our system. Those kinds of whether it's tax treatment or R&D investments can accelerate the deployment of clean energy and we look forward to that. There is a real problem with the ITC with solar that utilities can't because of normalization can't take full advantage. I think if there were some fixes from a tax perspective on the ITC for solar that could be interesting for utilities and could potentially make solar deployments more economic faster. And so I do think there will be some interesting developments with them if there is in fact a blue wave here in a couple weeks.\nStephen Byrd: That's helpful. \nRejji Hayes: The only thing I will add to Patti's comment is that obviously the tax credits can help address the cost related problem or cost-related challenge and that's a big element of thee equation, but the other elements of the equation obviously are resource adequacy and I'll also add balance sheet to that equation. And so I think if you're getting at whether that could lead to an accelerated retirement of coal, you'd have to see an improvement in the cost and again tax credits may get that but also the efficacy of those alternative resources if you really want to be comfortable taking out say two gigawatts of coal on an accelerated basis and then balance sheet Moody still continues to impute securitization as debt. And so again if you think about the rate base we have in our coal facilities and that potentially becoming dead in an accelerated fashion there are balance sheet issues as well. So I think cost is a huge component that tax credits could solve but we have to make sure that all elements of the equation add up to the interest of the triple bottom-line.\nStephen Byrd: Yes Rejji, it's a good point about sort of the balance sheet treatment if you're required to do a PPA and the negative impacts to your balance sheet. I guess if I were to thinking through what you both said if there were a way for utilities to actually really utilize the tax credits which could require modification well let's assume that that modification could happen and if there was a way by tax credits to reduce the cost of storage. Would those types of changes together potentially permit a somewhat more aggressive shift shutdown of coal and more aggressive deployment of renewable storage? Are those the kinds of changes that could actually kind of make a difference in your thinking?\nPatricia Poppe: Those are some of the changes. I think we have to prove the efficacy of these distributed resources Stephen. There's a lot of theories about it. I think we need to prove to ourselves that with a distributed resource mix we can provide the reliability that customers want. We can't have rolling curtailments because we didn't plan and don't have the resources necessary. So I think the timing when we think about our 2040 net zero plan that feels to us like a good timeline to really build out these new technologies and including the energy efficiency and demand response. Those things take time to enroll customers and get the right behaviors. And so I do think there's a two prong there's the cost as we've talked about but there's also as Rejji mentioned the efficacy of those resources and making sure that we can provide the reliability that customers expect and so that you have to actually build the stuff and prove it to ourselves before we can scale the whole system.\nStephen Byrd: That makes sense. Thanks so much for the thoughtful comments. That's all I had. \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thanks Stephen.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. \nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you. \nPatricia Poppe: Morning Travis. \nTravis Miller: I was wondering if you could give your thoughts on the role that you'll play in the healthy climate plan. I know you've got a lot of the goals already out there and the investments out there that correspond to the goals in that plan. But just wondering next year if you'll be involved specifically in the planning and goal setting around that and then kind of any other thoughts in terms of how it might affect say your next five years in the early stages of the plan?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. We will definitely be involved. We're a trusted resource here in Michigan as a clean energy leader and the clean energy advocates. I think it's just reaffirming to our clean energy plan that we filed and it certainly is an ambitious goal for Michigan, but we really intend to continue to be leaders and our IRP is very much in support of the governor's ambition.\nTravis Miller: Okay. What do you think about the political viability of that I mean when you're talking about 20 plus years of a policy obviously politics can change here? What are your thoughts around that and the buy-in from all the different parties in Michigan and industries even to five year plan?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. You make a great point because there's a couple things that are going to be challenging I think for Michigan but one of the things we've learned here in Michigan. The actual law that we passed in 2008 and then I'd say upgraded in 2016 is where the actual targets get set that drive actions and they're more near-term clearly. Our RPS for example in 2016 well in 2008 was 10% by 2015 and then 2016 we passed a law to take it to 15% by 2020. Those incremental concrete targets get passed in legislation. So you're absolutely right there needs to be a full appreciation and adoption and energy legislation here in Michigan has been typically happening about every eight years or so. So it would take some time I think to get new legislation passed. But nonetheless the other challenge here in Michigan with natural gas for example for home heating is very economic and so I think a politically a difficult uphill battle to tell all Michiganders are going to pay twice as much for their home heating I think that's a challenge that politically would be hard to overcome without a significant change over time.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So Patti you just mentioned your gas LDC and so I have two questions about it. One is this is really the first season that your gas LDC will be going through COVID like conditions so and obviously it's a bit of a guessing game. But do you have a similar customer mix on the gas side, the electric side and then so the trends that you've seen in volumes could be replicated at the gas utility you think?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. We don't expect the same kind of uptick in use. Most people heat their homes and keep them at that level they might lower it a couple degrees during the day while they're at work. But we don't expect sort of the increase that we've seen on the electric side. However, we are more residential mix on the gas business but we have ample supplies here in Michigan. We are blessed with robust energy, natural gas storage fields here in Michigan and we have no concerns about having any inability to meet the needs of our customers for their winter heating.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay and my second question is you just mentioned the economics of gas-based heating versus electric heat pumps in Michigan. But on the other hand we have seen this meaningful de-rating of standalone gas LDCs you guys own a big one. It's coupled with electric utility so you haven't seen an impact. But if you look at your longer term growth plans do you feel the need to shift some of your spending away from the gas LDC towards the electric utility because that's basically the preference of investors and also that's more of a trend to dig up decarbonize the entire entity?\nPatricia Poppe: Well, there's a couple thoughts as we look at our capital planning. Number one a safe and reliable gas system is extraordinarily valuable today and will be in the coming decades. Safety is always number one. And the replacements that we are doing are like for life. We're not adding capacity. We're making our system safer and by the way at the same time reducing methane emissions. So it's both good for people and the planet and then those investments obviously have reliable returns. So it's our triple bottom-line thinking there. I would also say that the electric utility, the combo the fact that we're a combo utility does make us hedge to some degree if there is a big push for electrification, if electric home heating becomes a real trend then we will be able to benefit from that and in fact the earnings potential is even greater in that perspective. But when we think about it from a triple line, bottom-line perspective we think we can do the net zero methane target for 2030 as we've stated through our capital investments in the gas system without hazarding sort of stranded assets and I guess I would just offer in a state like Michigan with the kind of temperatures we experience and the value that customers receive for the cost of natural gas we'll be the last to go. I mean, our customers are really going to, they appreciate our natural gas as a home heating source and so I think it'd be a long time before there's a big change there but when that change happens as a combo utility we're in a good position to weather that.\nAngie Storozynski: Great, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from [indiscernible] please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning Patti, good morning Rejji.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning. \nUnidentified Analyst: I know you addressed it earlier Durgesh\u2019s question, but you're comfortable with your business mix. I think utility is the one that's really growing like a 90% mix between regulated and non-regulated businesses. But if you start to see other utilities and I know you're not going to comment on DT, but if DT would go like 100% regulated or it seems that all utilities even that small slice of 10% of non-regulated earnings are CMS's benefit from maybe being one of the more robust valued companies, but would that cause you to look again at the business mix that you have?\nPatricia Poppe: You know like I said Anthony and I'll just reiterate we're really comfortable with our business mix 90:10 and when we think about our enterprises business in particular we learn a lot from customers having them in the family. We get a chance to understand what the competitive marketplace looks like and it makes us a better utility and so we're very satisfied as I mentioned with our business mix.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nPatricia Poppe: You're welcome. Thanks Anthony. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from David Fishman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nDavid Fishman: Good morning Patti and Rejji.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning David.\nDavid Fishman: Just a quick question on the IRP filings, I believe had about 1.1 gigawatts or so of solar 50% own 50 PPAs. I was just wondering if you could discuss if your thinking has evolved at all around maybe the appropriate balance between PPA and utility ownership in the future especially as CMS has started getting a little more scale and renewables and just how you might be able to deliver a better value for customers?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. We will refile an IRP every three to five years and so as I mentioned we're preparing for next summer to file our next one. The agreement that we made for 50:50 ownership and purchasing PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism we felt was a great outcome for customers. It's a competitive marketplace. We're getting to see and observe the landscape. We do continue to learn and it'll be interesting to continue to learn. So I guess I would say it's too soon to say that we would recommend a change because we feel like it has provided a huge benefit to customers and investors given the FCM combined with the ownership and the PPAs. So I would just suggest it is too early to say that we would recommend any kind of change there and we continue to learn and balance that triple bottom-line.\nDavid Fishman: I think that makes a lot of sense and just one quick follow-up on that. I know in the past you guys have kind of discussed how you like have a smoother less lumpy CapEx kind of project profile. Would having too many large renewable investment opportunities at once kind of be going away from that or is that something that you can get comfortable with just theoretically?\nPatricia Poppe: No. It is one of the things we love about renewables is that they are modular just in nature and so we can phase them in and as demand grows we can move them faster. If demand diminishes we can install them more slowly. We're not going to have just one big project. We're going to have lots of call it 200, 300 megawatt projects, maybe 100 megawatt projects and that gives us real modularity and I think that's a huge advantage to this clean energy transition over the old traditional just building big central station power plant, you were locked in. Once you dug that first hole there you went and that was going to be a real challenge if conditions changed and so we do love renewables for that feature.\nDavid Fishman: Perfect. Very helpful. Those are all my questions. Congrats on great quarter.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. Good morning everybody. A lot of good details so I've just got two quick one\u2019s for you. One housekeeping and one big picture. First it looks like the overall liquidity fell by about a billion dollars mostly related to lower unrestricted cash balance. Is that a timing issue and will it reverse or are you comfortable with the overall liquidity at around 2 billion versus over 3 previously?\nRejji Hayes: Andrew, I'll answer your last question first. I mean the quick answer is very comfortable with 2 billion net liquidity position and I mentioned in Q2 that the 3 billion that we had at that point there was a bit of timing in that where we had some looming maturity that just didn't flow through our second quarter numbers and they were pending and you'll see that if you compare the maturities in this document versus what we shared in the second quarter. We feel very good about the 2 billion. My sense it'll come down a little bit more again because in the nation stages of the pandemic we really wanted to err on the side of having excess liquidity particularly given the cost of funds but longer term again we will not have a bunch of lazy capital just sitting on our balance sheet. We'll put it to work and that's what we look to do over the next couple of quarters.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes. There is definitely a capital raising bonanza in March and April. That makes sense. My other question is maybe a little esoteric but you talked a bit about Michigan's naturally occurring natural gas storage fields in the context of hydrogen potentially being one of the next big things. Do you know geologically could those storage fields store hydrogen?\nPatricia Poppe: We are studying that. We understand that it's likely that they can and so we do find that intriguing and as we're doing our long-term gas planning, wandering and looking for opportunities to pilot being able to use hydrogen in a different way whether it's as a portion of our mix, whether we would use it in some blend in our power generating at our natural gas power plants or just in the system. So we're doing a lot of homework and study on hydrogen right now. We've joined with [indiscernible] and their carbon studies. So we're excited about learning more and we have a feeling that Michigan is going to be extraordinarily well-positioned if in fact that transformation starts to occur.\nAndrew Weisel: Good to hear. Thank you very much. \nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Andrew. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any final remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks Rocco and thanks again everyone for joining us today. I'd love to take just a moment to highlight that we will be working with [indiscernible] again this year to continue our efforts. We're never satisfied and so we're going to continue to pursue world-class performance including an investor relation. So be on the lookout for an email from the team for more details on that survey and we look forward to your honest feedback and continued support. We wish you all please be safe, be well and make sure to wear your darn mask. Thanks so much. Have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you ma'am. Today's conference is not concluded. We thank you for your participation. You may not expect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and good morning everyone. We hope you're all doing well and thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. This morning I'll share our financial results and outlook for the first nine months of the year. I'll also introduce our 2021 guidance, review our catalogue plan which supports our de-carbonization efforts and I'll touch briefly on our regulatory calendar. Rejji will add more details on our financial results and as always we will call for Q&A. We're happy to report that for the first nine months of the year, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.11, up 17% from the same period in 2019. Our year-to-date results were driven by our team's best-in-class cost management through the CE way. Given the risk mitigation in place for this year and our visibility into next year, we're pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint and introduce our adjusted guidance for 2021 of $2.82 to $2.86, up, you guessed it 6% to 8% from the midpoint of our current guidance range. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%, again with a bias to the midpoint, which I'll remind you reflects both consistent and industry leading growth. We remain grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom-line of people, planet and profit. We're committed to diversity, equity and inclusion and are doubling our spend on diversifiers over the next five years after having tripled our spend over the last seven. Just last month, the Governor of Michigan announced the State's goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 which supports our clean energy plan and all the actions we've already taken to protect our planet and reduce our carbon footprint. And before moving on, I want to highlight we're over $100 million in cost reductions realized year-to-date through the CE way. This is a true testament to the maturity of our CE way mindset and just what this team is capable of when called to action. My quick story of the month is from our team at Filer City generating station, who identified a shorter route throughout the building to perform operator rounds. This eliminated over one hour or 2,500 steps on each shift. The annual mileage savings are equivalent to the distance from the southern border of our state all the way to Mackinac Bridge. Now that's [indiscernible] about. Step-by-step, minute-by-minute, dollar-by-dollar it all heads up to the CE way. Our team has proven that we can put the pedal to the medal on cost performance to deliver the required results now and in the future. Our commitment to the triple bottom-line chime through in our capital investment plan that focuses on enhancing the safety and reliability of our system while keeping customer bills affordable, protecting our planet and delivering for our customers and investors as we move toward net zero. We benefit from a regulatory constructed Michigan and a statue that allows for the financial incentives above and beyond our current authorized ROE. These include a 20% return on our energy efficiency spend as we help customers reduce energy waste and lower their monthly bills. A financial mechanism equal to our weighted average cost of capital on new renewable PPAs and a premium ROE of 10.7% on renewable investments to meet our 15% renewable portfolio standard in Michigan. All of which illustrates that we can deliver reliably on the triple bottom-line what's good for our people and the planet can also deliver top tier profits. It's no wonder we're considered a leader in ESG. By 2024, we will have added 1,100 megawatts of solar to our system on top of 1 gigawatt of RPS renewables since 2011. Our clean energy plan calls for a total of 6 gigawatts of solar additions to our system or $3 billion to $6 billion of investment opportunities through 2040. As we move forward and file our next IRP in 2021, we will look to realize some of this opportunity and pulled into our plan as utility scale renewables continue to make triple bottom-line sense. Our commitment to serving all our stakeholders has not gone unnoticed. We've been recognized nationwide for our good efforts and slide 7 celebrates that recognition, including that as of 2019, CMS Energy received an MSCI ESG rating of AA. Moving onto our regulatory calendar. We settled our gas rate case last month and agreed not to file another gas rate case before December of 2021. We expect an order in our electric rate case and an outcome on our securitization filing by the end of this year. Following that we will not have any general rate case decisions impacting our 2021 earnings which provide further visibility and economic certainty throughout next year. Turning to my favorite slide, slide 9 reminds you of how we manage the work intra year to mitigate risk in future years and deliver the financial results you've come to expect. So in a year like this year when we've seen an enormous amount of headwinds, our team hunkered down and exercised our lean operations to find and eliminate waste at every level. To-date we've realized over a $100 million in saving through these efforts and I'm so very proud of all my co-workers for demonstrating world-class cost performance and enabling us to deliver savings through the CE way so that we can continue to deliver a world-class customer experience and consistent industry leading financial performance. Now, you might be wondering if that $100 million of savings would make us deviate from our bias toward the midpoint of the guidance range. It does not. We're sitting in the driver seat as we put the pilot savings to work for 2021 and 2022 and begin to de-risk those years. It is precisely this cost discipline which rollercoaster for you and instead delivers the consistent top tier annual growth rate every year, not just the easy ones. 7% year after year after year. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success and the year after that. We ride the rollercoaster so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you expect. And now I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thanks Rejji. Simply this, our model holds together well and that's why this thesis remains strong. With that Rocco please open the lines for Q&A. Good morning Jeremy. Yes Jeremy, great question. We are excited about our next filing of IRP which will be made a year 2021. We're still in the modeling phase. So no early read just yet. So I will say we're hopeful that an outer years in particular in our first filing we had about 450 megawatts of storage. I would love to see more storage in the outer years. We were requested in our settlement and agreed to study earlier requirements of some of the other coal plants, but right now our plan remains the same, but certainly when we know will let you know and we're excited about the potential that new IRP and what it offers to benefit the planet and the cost structure and our customers. It's really a great time in this business. Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning Michael. Yes, Michael you make a really good point in fact that we do have forward-looking test gears. And so what we like about our annual filing is first of all, just because we file a rate case doesn't necessarily mean customers bills are going up and as Rejji described in his prepared remarks, we can do capital investment and this business model of ours where cost savings are passed along to customers has to occur in those proceedings. And so our annual filing provides us two what I think are big advantages particularly given the certainty of the regulatory environment here in Michigan. One that we have alignment with the commission before we spend it. So we have no risk post a rate order that will have disallowances. We have alignment on the work that we're going to do. We have alignment on the investments that we're going to make and so that is a real certainty going forward. But two, it also allows us to adjust the plan as conditions change and we can pass along the cost savings that the team achieves while we're adjusting those plans. So we can build the budget, we can build an operating plan that matches and agreed upon framework with the commission. And so I think that's good regulation. I think that's the right kind of transparency, the right kind of certainty and yet at the same time demonstrates agility as we move forward and conditions change around us. I do think it's in the best interest of our customers. Yes. Exactly Michael in October 21, for example, we secured some contracts for planning year 24 and 25 and 25 and 26 at the $4.25 kilowatt month. We secured about 30 megawatts. So we're definitely seeing pick up that wasn't all the way at comp. But with the LCR, there's only all the few places within zone 7, which is Michigan's lower peninsula where an alternative energy supplier can secure that capacity and DIG is one of those places and so we've absolutely already seen a little bit of that upside. Great. Thanks Michael. Morning Shahr. Thank you. Yes. You bet just at the highest order as we have always said we work with everyone and so we're sure that America will sort out all of this election business. Now we know I think what to expect from Donald Trump and his administration and that's been working fine for us. If Joe Biden is elected and there's a stronger push for a clean energy transition or a carbon-free electric sector, we have a plan that's pretty aggressive already. We have a plan that gets to net zero by 2040. And so even when he says 2035 in kind of campaign ads the idea of it really being national at 2035 seems aggressive. But we could actually work to adapt. One thing we'd like to remind people about this is that as we make this clean energy transition and we've been very ambitious as you know we've retired seven of our 12 coal plants already reduced our carbon emissions by 40%. Our net zero plan for 2040 puts us again about a decade ahead of most in the industry and so given that we feel like there's a need for some technology advancements in those outer years and when those breakthroughs occur and as the cost of solar and potentially storage continues to decline we'll look forward to accelerating our plans. And we know that that can be good for both for our triple bottom-line people, planet and profit. So we're pretty agnostic on the outcome of the elections. We think there's our clean energy plan stands on its own. Rejji maybe you want to talk about some of the tax implications of Biden administration? Well, great questions Durgesh. First of all the interbank team, shout out to that team they're performing well and benefiting from this year actually from the uptick in home improvement. I've heard in fact it's called investing and nesting and interbank is being participating in that. So that's been good, but really the bottom-line is this we're very content with our business mix where it is. And I just want to remind everyone that our utility is far and away the driver of our growth at CMS energy with 90% of our business mix and really so to that end there is really nothing new to share about our non-regulated businesses and we just, we manage them very much like we manage our utility business with consistency, high quality off-takers long-term contracts, leveraging our core competency, downside risk management, no big bets we like our mix. Yes, it just ends up not really being on the top of our list given our organic growth strategy. We've got ample CapEx to deploy. People ask us because of the CE way is that something you could deploy and maybe someday we would want to but that's a long time from now. We really, we have a solid five year capital, ten year capital plan and the next five years we have got real visibility to our ability to deliver growth and shareholder value. You're welcome. Hey Jonathan. Yes, great question. We have a billion dollars, actually $1.8 billion in renewables in the five-year plan and the 10-year plan we have a potential for additional maybe even up to $3 billion of total renewables in the 10-year plan and so when we think about the three to six think of 2040 that's another 10 years. But our solar deployments are front end loaded. We have of our 6,000 megawatts of solar we intend to deploy by 2040. 5,000 of it is by 2030. So that really makes up and that's already in our 10-year plan but we'll share more visibility to that when we update the capital plan at the year-end call. Yes Jonathan. I will remind you that our six to eight are $0.04 range. So a single point we're practically a single point as it is. But we do think that this top tier 7% EPS growth for the sector is among the best and particularly when you factor in the consistency of it and I just think as a utility that you can count on for six to eight with a $0.04 range. The push to 8% it has a temporary benefit but we would prefer to have an annual take it home, take it to the bank, sleep at night we ride that straight, we ride that rollercoaster so you can plan on that straight line and so the idea of pushing it to eight what we've always said in fact when we first announced that we were going to six to eight years ago we said there might be a year that there were surprises to the upside. But what I want to be really clear about is that this year we have ample opportunity to redeploy those savings into protecting outer years and that's always our first priority. And so I don't want to mislead anyone and make them think there's going to be a sugar high in 2020. This is the perfect kind of year to plan for uncertainty we're heading into for 2021 and making sure that 22 can be delivered too. Yes. Thank you Jonathan. Good morning. Yes Stephen great question. A couple things. One I do think further tax incentives on storage would be beneficial. I think what's going to be more beneficial is the amount of R&D that's underway in storage. You and I have talked many times about the electric vehicles and all the research happening there on battery storage. Some of the research that's being done on hydrogen, both for fuel cells for vehicles but more importantly for us from a perspective of hydrogen as a fuel cell version of storage on our system. Those kinds of whether it's tax treatment or R&D investments can accelerate the deployment of clean energy and we look forward to that. There is a real problem with the ITC with solar that utilities can't because of normalization can't take full advantage. I think if there were some fixes from a tax perspective on the ITC for solar that could be interesting for utilities and could potentially make solar deployments more economic faster. And so I do think there will be some interesting developments with them if there is in fact a blue wave here in a couple weeks. Those are some of the changes. I think we have to prove the efficacy of these distributed resources Stephen. There's a lot of theories about it. I think we need to prove to ourselves that with a distributed resource mix we can provide the reliability that customers want. We can't have rolling curtailments because we didn't plan and don't have the resources necessary. So I think the timing when we think about our 2040 net zero plan that feels to us like a good timeline to really build out these new technologies and including the energy efficiency and demand response. Those things take time to enroll customers and get the right behaviors. And so I do think there's a two prong there's the cost as we've talked about but there's also as Rejji mentioned the efficacy of those resources and making sure that we can provide the reliability that customers expect and so that you have to actually build the stuff and prove it to ourselves before we can scale the whole system. Yes. Thanks Stephen. Morning Travis. Yes. We will definitely be involved. We're a trusted resource here in Michigan as a clean energy leader and the clean energy advocates. I think it's just reaffirming to our clean energy plan that we filed and it certainly is an ambitious goal for Michigan, but we really intend to continue to be leaders and our IRP is very much in support of the governor's ambition. Yes. You make a great point because there's a couple things that are going to be challenging I think for Michigan but one of the things we've learned here in Michigan. The actual law that we passed in 2008 and then I'd say upgraded in 2016 is where the actual targets get set that drive actions and they're more near-term clearly. Our RPS for example in 2016 well in 2008 was 10% by 2015 and then 2016 we passed a law to take it to 15% by 2020. Those incremental concrete targets get passed in legislation.

We're going to have lots of call it 200, 300 megawatt projects, maybe 100 megawatt projects and that gives us real modularity and I think that's a huge advantage to this clean energy transition over the old traditional just building big central station power plant, you were locked in. Once you dug that first hole there you went and that was going to be a real challenge if conditions changed and so we do love renewables for that feature. Thanks. We are studying that. We understand that it's likely that they can and so we do find that intriguing and as we're doing our long-term gas planning, wandering and looking for opportunities to pilot being able to use hydrogen in a different way whether it's as a portion of our mix, whether we would use it in some blend in our power generating at our natural gas power plants or just in the system. So we're doing a lot of homework and study on hydrogen right now. We've joined with [indiscernible] and their carbon studies. So we're excited about learning more and we have a feeling that Michigan is going to be extraordinarily well-positioned if in fact that transformation starts to occur. Thanks Andrew. Thanks Rocco and thanks again everyone for joining us today. I'd love to take just a moment to highlight that we will be working with [indiscernible] again this year to continue our efforts. We're never satisfied and so we're going to continue to pursue world-class performance including an investor relation. So be on the lookout for an email from the team for more details on that survey and we look forward to your honest feedback and continued support. We wish you all please be safe, be well and make sure to wear your darn mask. Thanks so much. Have a great day."

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you Patti and good morning everyone. In the third quarter we delivered adjusted net income of $221 million which translates to $0.77 per share. Our third quarter results were $0.04 above our third quarter 2019 results largely due to cost performance, constructive regulatory outcomes and favorable weather at the utility. It is worth noting that our adjusted earnings for the quarter excludes non-recurring items primarily related to retention cost associated with the pending retirement of our current coal facilities which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date we've delivered adjusted net income of $605 million or $2.11 per share, up 17% from the same period in 2019. As Patti noted, we're trending well in large part due to our company wide efforts in cost reduction largely driven by the CE way. As you know, we continue to monitor our electric sales and utility closely given that the pandemic is not yet fully contained and we remain encouraged with the trends we observed across each customer class over the course of 2020. On slide 11, you will see that weather normalized electric sales were up roughly half of a percent for the quarter versus the third quarter of 2019 with the residential segment continuing to lead the way up 6% for the quarter versus the comparable period in 2019. The commercial and industrial segments continue to recover down 4% and 3.5% respectively versus the prior year, which aligns well with the phase reopening of Michigan's economy. As noted in the past the weather normalized industrial and total electric sales I just quoted, exclude the effects of one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter in 2021, we're cautiously optimistic about the normalized trends we've seen so far in 2020 with normalized load for the residential segment continuing to outperform expectations, which I'll remind you offers a higher margin than those of our commercial industrial segments and has historically represented over 60% of our customer contribution. Turning to our waterfall chart on slide 12, you can see the current and expected drivers of our year-over-year financial performance. As mentioned, cost performance continues to be a key factor to our financial results for 2020 and as Patti noted we have delivered over $100 million of savings to date, the vast majority of which is represented in the $0.28 per share of cost savings highlighted in the table on the left hand side of the page and more than offsets the pandemic related expenses incurred to-date and mild weather experience in the first quarter. Rate relief net investments and less storm activity relative to the comparable period in 2019 provided $0.13 and $0.05 per share of positive variance respectively in the first nine months of the year. With three months to go in 2020, we'll plan for normal weather as we always do, which implies $0.02 per share of negative variance versus the prior year and is more than offset by the constructive outcome we achieved in our gas rate case settlement which equates to $0.07 per share of pickup in the fourth quarter. Needless to say we will remain paranoid by maintaining sufficient contingency to mitigate the inherent risk to our business such as weather and storms as well as a potential resurgence of virus in Michigan and will concurrently reinvest any estimated excess contingency to provide near and long-term value to our customers, co-workers and investors. As we look out longer term even with our significant success reducing costs in 2020 and in years prior there are still ample opportunities to reduce costs to create headroom in customer bills for future capital investments. As a reminder, the expiration of our large PPAs and the retirement of our coal fleet offer sustainable cost reduction opportunities over the next several years. We'll also realize capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems and will continue to reap the benefits of the ongoing maturation of the CE way. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right-hand side of slide 13, which highlights that we've kept customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan from 2007 to 2019 while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in our gas and electric systems over that timeframe. In fact, in 2019 our utility bills made up approximately 3% of household expenditures in Michigan, down a 4 percentage point from the 2007 level. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long-term given the widespread concerns about economic conditions or potential changes in fiscal, energy and/or environmental policy. You name the risk and I can assure you we've heard it before. Well, the reality is that change is the one constant that you can count on in this business and we'll continue to adapt to the inherent risks and other external factors that may impact our business and still deliver for our customers, co-workers, the planet and our investors as we have for almost two decades now as illustrated on page 14. And with that I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A. Yes Jeremy. We talked about in the past the impact that the residential segment has in our electric business and so the general \u2013 you're thinking about the annual impact is 1% change and residential equates to $0.03 of EPS accretion and that's symmetric so up or down. And for industrial and other side it's about half a penny for 1% change commercial rule close to residential. So it does have a pretty good impact and as you think about the road ahead I'll just remind you the electric case that we have pending that has a 4 test here which reflects all of 2021 and so we are contemplating a subsequent file of this electric rates case and so that will obviously have an impact on 2022. But if we continue to see a trend like we've seen over the course of this year, it could provide a potential tailwind in 2022, but we're still at obviously the early stages of our planning process for 2021. But I'd say the electric rate cases that's pending, the order on that will obviously dictate a lot of our economics going in 2021 in the existing gap settlement that we've already got provides a lot of economics going into 2021. Does that address your question? Yes Shahr just to be clear, we haven't provided a point of view based on our latest modeling for equity needs in 21 and beyond but I think the working assumption that we provided as we rolled out our five-year plan in the first quarter of this year. We said 250 this year as you rightly note, and then we send run rate 150 per year that presuppose a $12.2 billion five year capital plan at the utility. And so as you know, we provide a new five-year look in Q1 and every year on our fourth quarter earnings call and so it will calibrate, will look at what the capital plan looks like from 21 through 25. And if that dictates additional equity needs then we will adjust accordingly, but I will say this, I feel very confident that this has been our general rule of thumb that we will be able to continue. We need to increase equity need to fill line of the capital plan. We should be able to continue to avoid block equity and really just be able to execute our equity needs to our dribble program, which I generally like to think is around 1.5% to 2% of our market cap. So we feel that the equity needs may change. We'll see what the math ends up in our 5-year plan, but I don't expect us to be issuing material amount equity every year going forward. Yes. It's a great question Shahr and so I think generally, we look at identify and realize cost savings are two classes. There are operating cost savings and non-operating cost savings. What we highlighted in our prepared remarks and this has been an ongoing theme over the course of this year as well in Q2. The vast majority of the savings realized to-date have been operating savings. There have been some not operating savings. So you probably saw in a waterfall slide that we had about 7% the benefits. Those are clearly non-operating and then Sri and the team and treasury have been really quite opportunistic in executing on a very attractively priced financing of the course this year. I can come back on the exact EPS amount. I think we had about a penny or two of upside this year and we do anticipate a good portion of that being ongoing and sustainable because the reality is if you price the bond below plan particularly with the recent plan you obviously have their savings over the life of the bond. And now obviously our debt financing needs will increase to fund capital and so you have some new money in there, but to refi those lower bond financing particular when we pull forward a bond maturities we have in the past those savings you should get it for several years. Yes. So let me approach that in a couple of ways Shahr. So first there are I'll say the sales assumptions embeded in the pending election rate case which will capture all of fiscal year 2021 and so we're past the evidentiary phase. I don't want to pre-judge or foreshadow where the commission may end up. But I think clearly there is a change in the assumptions embedded in the rate case and then what we've observed over the course of 2020 and as we've talked about the last several quarters now we are seeing a favorable mix in the form of residential in excess of expectations and C&I I'll say slightly down. Now the variables which could lead to a tailwind in 2021, it's clearly residential. We've seen just this sustained level of residential non-weather uptick and I think it has a lot to do with remote working a number of companies have sustained that and we said we have a sense they may sustain it even post-pandemic and so that could provide a bit of a tailwind going into next year. And then the rate or pace at which C&I has recovered over the course this year has also been a little bit of surprise to the upside. And so going into the next year there's what's invented in the rate case and so there may be a little bit of upside there but then if you think about okay now that we're 10 months smarter since we filed our rate case what are we seeing and how do we think that compares to what we've seen over the course of 2020. And I'll say it's fair to assume that the pandemic started out in the kind of mid March timeframe in Michigan and we had the shelter in place in late March and so a lot of the effects of the pandemics are flowing through our 2020 forecast. And so when you think of the year-over-year comparison, I don't expect we'll see a material bump in residential versus what we've experienced so far in 2020 because again a lot of that's already reflected in our numbers but I do think C&I will see I think it could be flatish. I hate to put a letter to any type of shape of a recovery. I would say the Nike Swoosh seems to me to be the most applicable shape. I've also heard people talk about a K-shape because you will have some sectors that bounce back quickly and some that do not and so I hate the hazard to guess at this point. But I think it'll be a gradual recovery and a continued recovery for C&I. Again we've been surprised to be upset but pandemic has yet to be contained. So we'll obviously plan cautiously as we always do. Thank you Shahr. I'd be happy to. So Durgesh as you know the Biden team has rolled out at least a preliminary look on fiscal policy and so what we've seen is a potential increase in the marginal tax rate from 21% to 28% and since federal tax reform is in the two distant past you may recall just sort of the puts and takes that we saw there and so I think conceptually you can anticipate that there may be a rate increase and that's obviously the inverse of what we saw when we went from a 35% tax rate down to 21% and so there would potentially be a rate increase and the commission in Michigan was very thoughtful and how they incorporated that into our filing process and I anticipate that they'll probably take a similar approach. And so obviously that will eat into headroom, but I think we've proven time and time again irrespective of the headwind we'll manage the cost to make sure that our customers bills stay at or below inflation. And so there will be a likely rate impact that you see an increase in tax rate. Now the upside is that there was cash flow and credit metric degradation on the heels of federal tax reform. So if you see a 7% increase in the marginal tax rate you should see a cash flow benefit as well as some credit metric accretion on the other side of that and that will presumably lower our funding costs and that too will offset some of the rate impact. So I think you'll see some pros and cons and it's almost the inverse of what we saw when we had federal tax reform in 17. Good morning Steven. The only thing I will add to Patti's comment is that obviously the tax credits can help address the cost related problem or cost-related challenge and that's a big element of thee equation, but the other elements of the equation obviously are resource adequacy and I'll also add balance sheet to that equation. And so I think if you're getting at whether that could lead to an accelerated retirement of coal, you'd have to see an improvement in the cost and again tax credits may get that but also the efficacy of those alternative resources if you really want to be comfortable taking out say two gigawatts of coal on an accelerated basis and then balance sheet Moody still continues to impute securitization as debt. And so again if you think about the rate base we have in our coal facilities and that potentially becoming dead in an accelerated fashion there are balance sheet issues as well. So I think cost is a huge component that tax credits could solve but we have to make sure that all elements of the equation add up to the interest of the triple bottom-line. Andrew, I'll answer your last question first. I mean the quick answer is very comfortable with 2 billion net liquidity position and I mentioned in Q2 that the 3 billion that we had at that point there was a bit of timing in that where we had some looming maturity that just didn't flow through our second quarter numbers and they were pending and you'll see that if you compare the maturities in this document versus what we shared in the second quarter. We feel very good about the 2 billion. My sense it'll come down a little bit more again because in the nation stages of the pandemic we really wanted to err on the side of having excess liquidity particularly given the cost of funds but longer term again we will not have a bunch of lazy capital just sitting on our balance sheet. We'll put it to work and that's what we look to do over the next couple of quarters."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning everyone and welcome to the CMS Energy 2020 Second Quarter Results. The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used on this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through August 10th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I will turn the call over to Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Sri, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call everyone it is great to be with you. This morning I will discuss our strong first half results and the actions we have taken to adapt to the challenges in the current year, while keeping an eye on delivering our long-term growth in 2021 and beyond. Rejji, will add more details on our financial results, including impacts related to COVID-19 and offsets we are seeing from the CE way among other items. And as always, we will close with Q&A. For the first half, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 up 25% from the same period in 2019. Our first half results were primarily driven by best-in-class cost management, favorable sales mix and timely regulatory recovery as we continue to respond to the ongoing and ever changing circumstances presented by COVID-19. As we have demonstrated through our commitment to the triple bottom line and the CE way, we can tackle unsurpassed extreme challenges, operationally and financially presented by this pandemic and its resulting economic impact. Given the better visibility we have on the pandemic and Michigan's economy reopening, we are pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Again, with a bias to the midpoint. While ESG has been a more prominent topic recently. For us it is nothing new. Our long-term thesis is built and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people planet and profits underpinned by performance, which is our way of talking about and activating ESG in our decision making processes. It starts with people, of course, our co-workers, our customers and the communities that we serve. We continue to provide an essential service during these unpredictable times, while keeping our co-workers safe. Through smart work practices, including working-from-home, direct to job site reporting, social distancing, in our work locations and ensuring we have adequate testing and PPE. During this pandemic, the social awakening and the local flooding in Midland, Michigan. We have leveraged our foundation to support our customers and communities. Our ability to respond and deeply care for our coworkers and communities is made possible through the diverse team we have here at CMS Energy. We have maintained a strong commitment to diversity at CMS for many years. And this is reflected in the makeup of our Board and our Management team. But our work is far from complete, which is why I'm excited about our recent promotion of Angela Tompkins as our Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. While all of us owns the efforts to improve Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at all levels. Angela's leadership will be vital for us now and in the future. Angela co-authored our DENI strategy in conjunction with the senior management team over the past several years. As a result of this focus, we were prepared for this time and the important conversations that are underway inside our company and nationwide. Our focus on the planet has not wavered. We have net zero plans for both our gas and electric businesses, which are among the most aggressive in the industry, both in terms of magnitude and timing. While our efforts in the future are ambitious, including over six gigawatts of added solar over the next 20-years, I would like to remind folks, we have already made an enormous amount of progress with the closure of our seven of our 12 coal plants, with the next two scheduled for closure in 2023. In addition to new renewable, we are replacing our retiring capacity with new and innovative solutions, such as our demand response program we ramped up this year, with our first of its kind partnership with Google to offer 100,000 Nest thermostats free to our customers. We believe in a clean and lean energy future and we plan to lead the way. All our efforts and success wouldn't be possible without the capital you provide. So that last piece for profit is always top of mind. As you can see in the numbers, and as we are highlighting for you this morning, our co-workers have been busy since we last updated you successfully identifying over $65 million of operating cost reductions since the pandemic began. In addition to a variety of year-over-year savings totaling $0.19 year to-date, and our foot is on the gas. Our lean operating system provides the ability to create reductions like these in the current year, and enable delivering in the years to come as the savings carry forward. And backed by popular demand, it is time for my story of the month. This one comes from our Jackson Generating Station where twice a year we replace couplings that helped maintain lubrication on each of the six gas engines there. So that is 12 replacements over the course of the year. Now, while this is often routine work, the team at the plant didn't just follow the routine. They brought their 18-years of on the job experience to the table and recommended an alternative coupling, which had the same performance and life expectancy but as a fraction of the cost. The team took ownership with the CE Ways as they propose this cost saving idea. This simple but important change lead over $30,000 of annual savings. Now, some of you may be saying Patti, come on $30,000 is not a lot of money. But what you forget is that there are thousands of stories like this across our company. And when you add up nickels and dimes, you get dollars in size. So I would like to give a shout out to my three co-workers who made this happen Ted, Dave and Bush thank you guys for taking full ownership of our Company's financial and operational targets, and delivering for all of our stakeholders. This is just one example of how our co-workers are feeling empowered to apply the CE Ways to their everyday work and ultimately improving performance throughout the whole company. The visual on Slide 6, my personal favorite serves as another reminder of our team's ability to adapt to deliver the financial results you have come to expect, regardless of the headwinds. 7% EPS growth every year is not an accident. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success. Consistency is our Hallmark. And this year is no different. We continue to ride that roller coaster and it has been a wild ride so far this year, so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you have come to expect. Looking to regulatory matters. Commissioner Dan Scripps was recently named Chair of the Public Service Commission here in Michigan. He has taken over for Commissioner Talberg, who is being considered for a new role at the Ercot Board beginning in January 2021. We want to thank Tally for her leadership and look forward to continuing to work with her through the remainder of her time on the Commission. We congratulate Dan Scripps as he transitions into his new role. We will remind you that the Commission ordered utilities to defer uncollectible accounts and track those expenses above what is currently approved in rates which speaks to our constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. We are thankful to be able to work with the Commission to serve our customers in a caring way during this very uncertain time. We also have pending Gas and Electric rate cases and the MPFC staffs position in both demonstrate great alignment with our capital investment plan and rate base growth. We expect an order in our gas case in October and on our electric case by the end of the year. Thanks to low price commodities. Our cost saving capability and no big bets investment philosophy. We can both invest in safety, reliability and resilience of our infrastructure and protects customers from price spikes and surprises through tough economic times like these. The needs of our system do not change, because of a global pandemic and our customers' expectations don't either. Our business model allows us to serve both. Now turning to enterprises, where I'm pleased to highlight the measured growth of our contracted renewables business. As you may have seen last week, we acquired a majority ownership of a 525 megawatt contracted wind project. Construction of the project is largely complete and has an expected commercial online data set for later this month. The project will offer utility like returns and is largely committed to Facebook and McDonald's as customers. The bulk of the project is being financed with tax equity, and the remainder will be financed with cash-on-hand from our upsize hybrid offering and without the need to issue incremental equity beyond our plans $250 million this year. This project continues our track record of developing renewables for key corporate customers, while minimizing risk and providing attractive returns to complement our existing portfolio of assets, including DIG.\nOperator: As you are well aware, especially this year, conditions are always changing. Our entire team has demonstrated our ability to adapt for the good of the people we are privileged to serve. This agility has enabled us in the past and will enable us in the future to deliver consistent industry leading performance year after year after year. With that, I will turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Patti. And good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $139 million which translates to $0.49 per share. Our second quarter results were $0.16 above our Q2, 2019 results largely due to cost performance, favorable weather and rate relief net of investment related costs utility. Our non-utility business performed as expected. As EnerBank had increased origination volume and enterprises had planned outages at its [indiscernible] facilities. Our adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude select non-recurring items primarily related to severance and retention costs associated with the pending retirement of our coal facilities and expenses resulting from a voluntary co-worker separation program, both of which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $384 million or $1.35 per share up 25% from the same period in 2019 as Patty noted. All-round we are tracking as planned and navigating the impacts of the pandemic by delivering on cost reduction initiatives and planning conservatively. As highlighted during our first quarter call, we are closely monitoring our electric sales of the utility, which has historically been our most sensitive financial metric during economic downturns, particularly in the commercial industrial segments. At the end of April when we were in the initial stages of the pandemic, with extensive social distancing measures in place statewide, and most businesses closed, we experienced significant declines in our commercial, industrial normalized load, while residential load increase as people stay at home. I'm pleased to report that with a phase reopening of Michigan's economy over the past few months, C&I Electric sales have begun to recover, particularly in the higher margin commercial segment. And what we are witnessing in Michigan is that while businesses reopen they are maintaining high levels of mass tele-working, which drives power consumption at homes during business hours. So our residential sales have remained elevated while commercial industrial sales are starting to return to their pre-pandemic levels. Our normalized low trends for the quarter reflects some of this, we are even more encouraged by what we have observed in July, given the visibility afforded by our smart meter technology. The bar chart on the upper left hand side of Slide 11, highlights our year-to-date normalized load trends, which show total electric sales down about 5% exclusive of one large low margin customer. However, the aforementioned favorable sales mix has largely mitigated the year-to-date decline in normalized load. And I will remind you that every 1% change in residential sales equates to over $0.03 of EPS impact on a full-year basis. And our combined electric and gas customer contribution skews towards the residential segment. Our sales outlook for the full-year reflects a sustained level of favorable mix in residential sales up around year-to-date levels and with conservative assumptions around the recovery of the commercial industrial segments. Lastly, given that the Corona Virus is not yet fully contained. The low end of our sales outlook range incorporates a stress scenario, which assumes a second wave during the latter part of the year. Switching gears to EPS. You can see the key items impacting our financial performance relative to 2019 and our waterfall chart on Slide 12. If I could summarize in two words the key driver of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, it would be cost performance. As noted in the table on the left-hand side of the page, as Patty noted, we delivered $0.19 of positive variance versus 2019 by reducing operating and non-operating costs throughout the business, which more than offset the $0.07 of negative variance due to weather in the first half of the year, and the C&I sales degradation and emerging costs directly attributable to the pandemic. It is also worth noting that the levels of cost savings achieved and just the first half a year exceed previously referenced historical levels of cost performance over the past 10-years. As we step into the second half of the year, as always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case implies $0.07 of negative variance versus the prior year. We are also assuming a constructive outcome in our pending gas case, which equates to $0.02 per share of pickup. Lastly, we are ever mindful of a potential resurgence of the virus in Michigan, and other common sources of risk to our business such as mild weather and storms. As such, we are planning conservatively by continuing to deliver on our cost reduction initiatives to establish sufficient contingency to any of the aforementioned risks arise. You can see on the table on the right hand side of the page, RS into the potential EPS impacts of the forecasted sales range I referenced on the prior slide, which, as noted incorporates a potential second wave in Michigan, as well as additional expenses related to the pandemic, which we estimate at $0.09 per share in aggregate. To offset these potential cost and potential risks. We are on-track to deliver another $0.10 per share of cost savings, which is further supported by an additional $0.10 per share of weather related tailwinds that we have observed in our July electric sales. This Slide path provides good financial flexibility heading into the final five months of the year to mitigate risks that emerge in 2020, while beginning to de-risk 2021 and beyond through operational costs pull ahead and other means to the benefit of customers and investors. Now on the capital, our customer investment plan remains on-track for the year as we have continued to make progress on our numerous electric and gas supply and infrastructure projects, while keeping our co-workers safe, by adhering to the CDC guidelines. We are often asked whether we have seen disruptions in our supply chain for renewable projects and I'm pleased to report that we remain on-track on all fronts. In fact, our Gratiot and Hillsdale wind farm projects, which will collectively supply over 300-megawatts and help us meet Michigan 15% renewable standard by 2021 on course for commercial operation in 2020. Generally, we continue to make progress towards the 1100-megawatts of new solar supply through build transfer agreements and contracted solutions by 2024. As a reminder, this represents the first tranche of the 6000-megawatt program that Patti noted as approved in our integrated resource plan in June of last year. Longer term, our current plan calls for approximately 12 and a quarter billion dollars of customer investments over the next five-years, and supports rate based growth of 7% over that period. This capital plan reflects the continued monetization of our electric and gas infrastructure, as well as increase investments to de-carbonize our electric generation assets. We will also remind you there a five-year customer investment plan is not limited by the needs of our system, but instead buy balance sheet constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability. To elaborate on the point around customer affordability as we work toward delivering on cost reduction initiatives in 2020. Our bias remains toward projects that deliver sustainable savings to create long-term headroom and customer bills. As you will note on Slide 14, our $5.5 billion cost structure offers ample opportunities to reduce costs through the exploration of high price PPAs. the retirement of our full fleet capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems, and the continued maturation of the CE Way. The long-term headroom created in our electric and gas bills by these efforts will support our substantial customer investment needs of the utility to the benefit of customers and investors. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right hand side of the slide, which illustrates how we have managed to keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan law investing over $17 billion of capital over that timeframe. As I have said in the past, paying $5 to $6 per day, for clean, safe and reliable electricity natural gas is an extraordinary value proposition due in no small part to our cost discipline and triple bottom line mindset. Switching gears to our financing plan, we are quite active in the second quarter, opportunistically tapping the market to complete the vast majority of our planned financings for the year. From an equity financing perspective we announced our Q4 call, our plan to issue up to $250 million of equity all of which is priced under existing equity for contracts. And we exercise $100 million of that capacity late March with the remaining $150 million tranche still outstanding. We also filed a perspective supplement during the quarter for $500 million to refresh our ATM program, which is intended to cover our equity needs over the next three years. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help de-risk the future. We have also maintained a healthy bias toward liquidity management, with over $3 billion of net liquidity available in the event the capital markets become choppy again. As we look ahead, we will continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodative market conditions when they emerge. And with that, I will pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Rejji. Our team is committed to delivering for customers and you, our investors. The capital you provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. We remain good stewards of our balance sheet with prudent planning and already this year we have executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. We continue to rely on the CE Way and lean into their lean operating system we have in place. And as a result, we improve both our cost structure and our customer experience each and every day. Michigan continues to remain a top tier regulatory jurisdiction with forward looking test years and 10-month rate cases, we are fortunate to have much constructive regulatory framework in statute. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. We are fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs retiring. None of this comes at a price to our planet, and our home state of Michigan. Our net zero carbon and methane plans remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well and that is why the thesis remains strong. And that is why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this ongoing pandemic, just as it has in the past and will do in the future. With that Rocco, will you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you very much, Patti. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from James Thalacker with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJames Thalacker: Good morning, guys. How are you?\nPatricia Poppe: Great. Good morning to you.\nRejji Hayes: Hey, James.\nJames Thalacker: Just real quick follow-up. Maybe this one is for you, Rejji. Clearly July has been hot and you have actually had the benefit of the mix with revenue continuing to be very, very strong, commercials kind of trending on the on the lower end of where your forecast was. But industrial is kind of on the higher end. As you as you think about sort of the full-year, it seems like those things have kind of bounced out and kind of kept in check, as you have pushed cost savings through but, Rejji mentioned kind of sort of maybe we see a double dip on COVID as we go into the back half of the year. How are you thinking about those sales forecasts, as we think about the second half, in case we do have sort of a resurgence in the virus?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, James, good question. So, we did take that into account. And so I will point you to Slide 11, where we show the downside range embedded in our full-year forecast in the lower left hand corner of the page. And so you can see we are taking into account a potential second dip and a stress scenario and so that shows commercial backing up to around 12% on full-year basis, which obviously means that the latter two quarters will be quite bad. And then you can see industrial at 18%, again on the low end. And that excludes one large low margin customer, which would even make that number a little lower. And so we are taking that into account. And I will also point you to the next slide, Slide 12, we estimate what that margin impact will be at $0.07 of EPS dilution. We are also mindful of the potential emerging costs that may come around if there is a second dip. And so we are taking into account quarantine related expenses, potential sequestration related costs and we think that that is probably another $0.02. And so all in we think there is about $0.09 of EPS related delusion in the event, there is a double death. And so when we look at July sales based on our smart meter data coupled with our cost savings that we feel very good about achieving over the second half of the year, we feel like we have sufficient cushion to stomach that downside case. Now obviously, it is a pandemic and so you this is unprecedented, but we feel good about the road ahead just based on our current calibrations.\nJames Thalacker: Okay, great. Thanks for pointing that out. I appreciate it. Congratulations on a great quarter.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning, Jonathan.\nRejji Hayes: Hey.\nJonathan Arnold: Rejji could I just ask you, if you can give us a little bit more of a sense of the sort of trajectory that you have seen on the sales in different classes. You are obviously showing us here today. We have the second quarter and the release. And then you made some comments about July, sort of trending better, I think, before we talk about the weather, but just a feel for kind of how you maybe the sort of latter part of this period is looking relative to the Q2 average?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, sure. I would say it is been a very nice progression. If you think about the months in Q2, obviously April, I would say represented the bottom bottoming out. And so as we highlighted in our Q1 call where we had pretty good visibility on April, we were down about 20% to 25%. And then as we progressed into May and June, we saw a very nice progression as the state reopened. And so first you had the industrial sector start to come back around mid-May, and then non-essential retail shortly thereafter. And so with the graduate reopening of the state, we are now seeing C&I levels really come in. And so to give you a data point, for June for commercial, we were about 9% down. And we were basically 20% to 25% down in April. So, there is been a nice recovery and the July trends at this point, it is early days, and so I really try not to overreact to Smart Meter data, but we are looking at about 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels for our commercial industrial sales. And so there is been a very nice, gradual recovery month-over-month, over the course of Q2 and now into July. So we are cautiously optimistic. And you can see that reflected in the full-year forecast. But needless to say, we plan conservatively. And so in the event, there is a double dip, twin peak, whatever you want to call it. We are going to make sure we have enough cost savings and other sources of contingency to mitigate that risk. Is that helpful, Jonathan?\nJonathan Arnold: That is great. Thank you for that. And then just on - there was a number mentioned $65 million on cost saving. And I heard it was Patti's prepared remarks that was incremental to what you delivered in the first half, but could you just tie that 65 back to what you showing on Slide 12 for example. Where is that? \nPatricia Poppe: Yes, Jonathan that is embedded in $0.19 year-to-date savings. But part of the $65 million will carry through and be realized as the year progresses. So there really is sort of apples and oranges. But let me be clear about a couple things. $55 million is definitely not the finish line. And again, as you have noted, it doesn't reflect all of the year-over-year savings year-to-date. The team's identified $65 million in operational cost reductions so far this year. And so when we add in other year-over-year additional non-operational savings, that is again, what Rejji's point about $0.19 year-to-date. But again, that is not the full-year number. And it is a little bit apples and oranges. But one of the things to remind you is that, our best ever performance was $0.15 for a full-year. We talked about that in Q1. And so you can see why we are so proud of this team. And why I'm glad that we started preparing for this year four years ago when we launched the CE Ways. You can't make a friend when you need one. And it takes time. And so I'm grateful that we are launching a cost savings program this year. We are relying on our friends, the CE Ways, and she is delivering record levels this year right on time. So, I would be happy to give some additional color to that. But just like the story of the month, that literally is happening all over the company. And it is been four years in the making so proud of the team.\nJonathan Arnold: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Congratulations on continued success as you say on CE Ways. But if I can perhaps start with the last question left off? Can you talk about how much contingency you have left in your program? Obviously, I imagine and even prepared for a second quarter results, the way that the July weather has trended already has shifted to meet and your overall expectations for contingency even relative to the $0.10 that you were after the back half of the year. So can you talk about how this even positions you in the 2021 based on what even you are disclosing here if that is a fair way to ask the question as well.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, it is a great question, Julian, because we are thinking about it all the time. Rejji talked about the $0.10. And so that is sort of in our pocket in the event of greater risk as the year progresses, but we are always redeploying cost savings back into the business. So it is never a question of what is sustainable for us or whether we are constantly finding those savings. We are constantly eliminating waste and then we redeploying those savings as needed. What is cool about these smaller savings and the way we do it is it gives us optionality. We will improve the number of miles trimmed for example per dollar or reduce the cost per visit service replaced. But then if we can trim more trees or replaced more services we will whether that is in the current year, because we have got favorability or in the future year because in fact, we pull ahead work. So, we have got $0.19 year-over-year cost savings or about $75 million, which again, that is not an accident. We are in the process of planning for 2021. But the key is like every year, we maintain a significant amount of flexibility to manage our business to meet both the commitments to customers. And to you, our investors and great analysts like Julian, you know we ride this roller coaster so that no one else has to. Everyone else, all of you get to toe on those consistent, predictable outcomes because we are making those choices year-in and year-out. So, now when we look at what we have achieved year-to-date and expect for the rest of the year. Quite a bit of that can carry over into next year. But again, we always fine tune and in a particular year we aligned the plan also to our what is in rates. So, we are just continuing to conclude our rate cases which we will be able to align with our approved plans, and then our cost savings can be deployed as required. Is that helpful?\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Absolutely, thank you. If I can pivot a little bit more to the strategic question here, obviously, you guys are getting deeper into the contracted win signed outside of rate base. Can you speak a little bit more to how you see that business evolving in capital commitments within that, and maybe if I can ask it this way. How do you think about that as a percent of the total growth overtime. Is it six to eight or just really kind of supplementary complimentary however you want to think it or frame it, curious, just given how large this initial investment is on the platform?\nPatricia Poppe: Great question, Julian. I will start and then I will let Reggie add some more of additional details. The key criteria for us as we look at these opportunities. They are always opportunistic, given the market conditions, given the demands, we need to make sure that three things are true. Number one, that they are customer driven. We aren't doing one-off auctions to acquire assets. We are not way back in the development phases of projects. We are working with customers to have a repeatable business. And so for the example of Aviator wasn't an option. We knew the developer and these customers have a desire to grow their renewable energy and we are in a great position to further those needs. It is a key component of the planet part of our triple bottom line. Number two, they have to had utility like or better returns, our utility business has a lot of demands for capital, it is got a lot of opportunity for growth. So, a project like Aviator has to compete with other utility projects. Given that the bulk of our growth for the company is driven by the utility. These projects have to be really good for them to get a yes from us here. Number three, they need to not add risk to the consolidated business. So, this project, for example, has two high quality credit worthy off takers. You saw in the press release McDonald's and Facebook, the term of the PPAs are greater than 10-years. So, that is a good example of an opportunistic project that came to us, because we have got a reputation of being able to close the deal and operate it well. And when it meets that criteria, then we continue looking at it. And so when we think, though about the long-term growth of the company to your question about the role it plays in six to eight, the enterprises business plays about a 5% of our earnings now. We don't expect to have n-regulated growth beyond that 10% of our total Company portfolio. So, the bulk of our growth is utilities. That is our bread and butter. That is what we focus the bulk of our time on. But where enterprises can grow with the utility doing what we do well, which is operate renewable projects and we serve customers well, then it is a nice compliment to the - and a portion a - piece of that 6% to 8%.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Julian, the only thing I would add to Patti's good comments. Patti mentioned in her prepared remarks that there was a slug of tax equity. And that was not an insufficient slug. And so, if you look just on the surface and see 525 megawatts and then apply what you think is the standard cost per kilowatt, you can think the investment is quite sizable, but again, there is a pretty material slog of tax equity. And we are also a joint owner of the common equity for lack of a better characterization. And so, this really is not all that significant and investment from our perspective. In fact, it is quite comparable to the size investment we did for Northwest Ohio a year and a half ago. And so, we are being as Patti noted, opportunistic. We are trying to hit singles and doubles here. We are not swinging into fences. And so, we will approach this as the type of business where again it can be I think here where it is complimentary or supplement our portfolio, but again, we are not triples in homerun here.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Fair enough. I will leave it there. Thank you. \nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted ask a little bit more about the financing year-to-date in Page 15. It looks like you are well ahead of the initial plan. And a lot of that seems like it was done since the 1Q call. So wasn't purely reaction to your uncertainties around COVID I'm sure. Can you just walk us through why you were so aggressive with the debt, what your plans are for those term loans and how you think about the liquidity at over $3 billion.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So, Andrew, I will take the last part of your question first. I mean, at the end of the day we do not intend to have a bunch of lazy capital sitting on our balance sheet. And so we fully expect the $3 billion to come down quite a bit by the end of the year. But again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we are biasing towards liquidity management because the viruses and get contained. And so in the event, there is increased or continued volatility in the capital market, we want to just make sure we have sufficient liquidity. Now, as you think about the components on page 15. You can see from a first mortgage bond perspective at the OPCO, we are well in excess of what we hadn't planned at $1.2 billion But I will just note that there are a couple of maturities that we are dressing that will make those numbers look a bit more normalized. And so we have a term loan that you can see that we have yet to repay again, in the interest of just erring on the side of extra liquidity, particularly given the relatively low cost. And so that is a $300 million term loan. We also pulled forward a maturity at the OPCO in 2022 that had a five handle and so a very nice bit a positive carry in that trade. And so you take the two of those together that year-to-date, first mortgage bond issue to-date looks much more normalized relative to what we have in plan. And again, thinking about that same logic at the HoldCo. We did the hybrid, which is a lot higher than what we anticipated. But that is again, we have some flexibility in prepaying a term loan before it comes due or as it comes due. So I wouldn't overreact. We have just been opportunistic and really, again, erring on the side of liquidity. But again by the end of the year, I would be surprised if we were at that level of excess liquidity again by year in particular given the capital needs we have at the utility.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay, great, that is helpful. Next, just to be very clear, on page 12, the waterfall for the six months ago. That risk and opportunity box, obviously you are showing somewhere between $0.02 and $0.09 of negatives versus $0.20 of positives. That I believe the minus $0.07 to minus $0.03 you have for cost savings usage and other. Am I reading this right that you are basically saying that negative is kind of what you are expecting from COVID, but you have $0.10 of additional cost offset and $0.10 of July, whether that should help you out. And if that is the case, if nothing else changes, would you be able to reinvest those $0.20 by year-end?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so the quick answer is we feel quite good about the contingency that we have expect to have accumulate over the - particularly when you take July weather. So, you have effectively some excess contingency based on the numbers we are seeing. What I will note that just for full clarity is that cost savings as you can see - there is a lot more than just the items we have enumerated in that table. And so it is a hodgepodge of things. But we just highlighted here what we think is most noteworthy. And again we have taken into account in this math in the table, a stress scenario which obviously is in our base case, what we are seeing even in the event that we start to see margin erosion for commercial industrial like we on Page 11 - we still think that couples with cost that both could come again, if you have a second wave, we feel like we have generated and will generate enough cost savings, as well as with the July weather where we have sufficient contingency. But, Patti, if you would like to add to that, by all means,\nPatricia Poppe: Well, I will just get to the latter half of your question, Andrew. We expect that we will be able to redeploy funds this year, for the benefit of customers, and we are always planning for next year. So, we just want to make sure that we always and we have great capability to deploy those funds as required and pull ahead expenses and so we have got ample time between now and year end to make those adjustments. And we have had some success with some regulatory treatment, near year end where we can push forward some programs and some benefits for customers into future years. And so we really think that there is a good opportunity for us to leverage any favorability that we would have this year to serve customers and investors.\nAndrew Weisel: Good positioned to be and I'm sure your trees will be well trimmed by year-end?\nPatricia Poppe: Our customers love that and so do we.\nAndrew Weisel: Great. One last one if I can on the rate cases, your neighbors in Michigan recently settled their natural gas case and differ the electric case by a year. I know that no two utilities or rate cases are the same. But do you see potential for something similar for your rate cases? Are there certain factors that may preclude taking actions like this?\nPatricia Poppe: You know it is a creative option leveraging those deferred income taxes and so certainly would be open to considering it. We will keep looking at it. We have got good alignment with the staff on both our electric and our gas cases they are both in flight as we speak. And so we would look at it. But I will remind you that we don't object to annual filings for two reasons. Number one, it allows us to flex the Capital Planning, all of our rate cases are forward looking. And so as needs of the system change, as conditions emerge and because we don't have a big bet capital plan, we can modify our plan on manual basis to best reflect the greatest needs for customers. And so that is important to us. But I would also say that our rate cases are also opportunities to pass on cost savings to customers. And so when we think about the last seven years, for example, we have invested $15 billion of capital and our electric bills are down 5% and our gas bills are down 30%. I mean, that is the math that backs-up our business model that says, we can invest capital, particularly capital that saves customers money in the transition to cleaner energy and the reduction of these large PPAs that are coming forward. Skipping rate cases actually prevents us from passing along savings to customers. So we certainly are taking a look at the deferred income tax and perhaps delaying a case, but it isn't necessary for us to protect the affordability for our customers.\nAndrew Weisel: Great. Thank you so much. \nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nPatricia Poppe: Good morning Shar.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It is actually [Indiscernible] here for Shar. Congrats on great quarter.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nUnidentified Analyst: A lot of questions have been already answered. And it has been very comprehensive. But just going back to the Aviator project. Just wanted to kind of get some thoughts on kind of given that the decoration was prompted kind of relatively outside of plan I guess. Does that imply returns above utility ROE. And part of this acquisition said within the current CapEx plan.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so I can tell you the [Indiscernible] and thanks for the question. So as Patti noted, I think we evaluate all these projects, when we are looking at capital allocation across the company. Because it is quite competitive internally. We make sure that the returns are comparable to those of the utility if not better. And so we feel quite good about the economic profile of this project. And again, as Patti noted, we also want to make sure that we are not ascribing a lot of terminal value to these types of projects. And that there is very good credit worthy uptick. And we feel like this project checks those boxes. Now, we do not conflate utility capital investments with these types of projects in the $2.25 billion that we highlighted in our Q4 2019 call. We are still on-track to deliver that. And this is again opportunistic, it is not changing our financing plan, as Patti noted. And so, we feel like this is a nice opportunity to take advantage of. It is not a triple or a homerun, it is a single or double and this aligns with how we would like to evaluate and take on projects like this going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi, guys.\nPatricia Poppe: Hi Mike.\nRejji Hayes: Hey Mike.\nMichael Weinstein: A lot of my questions were answered. But wanted to get on Slide 21. Just the NOLs and credits that are increasing overtime that because you have more renewable projects that you are expecting to bring in overtime, or is that just from the existing project portfolio?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, it is more to form. I mean, we have always had a good balance of NOLs and credits. But we do see a little bit of accretion in that balance because of some of the renewables we expect. So that is larger, but that is Michael.\nMichael Weinstein: So I mean, that would imply that you are probably not going to have much of a tax appetite and you would probably have to continue using tax equity as you invest in these renewables.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, where we sit at this point, we don't expect to be really a meaningful federal taxpayer until around 2024. And so our sense is that tax equity will likely be this financing vehicle for some time.\nMichael Weinstein: And is it possible, could you give us a sense of the cost that you are seeing for it out there? Where is the cost of capital.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I will say it is attractive. as you know obviously, it is not as cheap as a debt - plain or common debt financing. But also, it is not as expensive as traditional common equity. And so it is in between and we think the rates that we have negotiated for this particular transaction are quite competitive.\nMichael Weinstein: And so I mean you are not seeing for instance, a decline in investor appetite due to the lower tax rates?\nRejji Hayes: No. like I said this a pretty meaningful slug of tax equity that is been in this project and for other projects that we evaluate from time-to-time. We haven't seen any contraction in the market for tax equity, but we will see. I mean, obviously, if there is another bit of volatility in the market, because there is a double dip or twin peak, whatever you want to call it, now market may back up for now, it is been quite accommodative.\nMichael Weinstein: Okay. And one last question. I mean, with the increase in NOLs that you have - in tax credits are in that on Slide 21. How many more projects do you think that sort of implies by 2024?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I wouldn't say it is that, I wouldn't say our financial planning is that prescriptive. Again, we intend to be opportunistic on these types of projects. And so we are assuming I think, a modest level of additional project flow and that is where you see again a modest bit of credit accretion. So again, we are not swinging for the fences here and assuming that there is going to be material increase in our NOLs or our credit specifically because of projects like this.\nMichael Weinstein: Got you. Alright, thanks a lot, Rejji. Thanks a lot Patti.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: And our question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning.\nPatricia Poppe: Hey. Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Yes. Good morning. Just one question for me here. With the bank side, just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more color on how things shaped up the second quarter relative to your expectations there and just general thoughts and trends to the balance of the year on the bank side would be helpful?\nRejji Hayes: Sure. I think the quick answer is the bank is on-track. And so we have got it to $0.18 to $0.20 for the full-year and they are on course to deliver that. Now, you will see for the quarter, and for the period-over-period comp, they were behind by about a penny that was per plan, because they started the year quite well. And obviously we have implemented the new accounting standard current expected credit losses and so that has a material impact on the provision for loan losses. And so when you comp it to 2019 you may see in the third quarter a little bit of leakage quarter-over-quarter. But we are fully on-track we have continued to see very good origination volume across most of the projects that we provide financing for and I think June was a historical month of loan approvals and loan originations. And so we are trending on plan and really haven't seen much backup, but for I would say April to for a little period of time.\nJeremy Tonet: That is very helpful. Thank you for taking my question.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. \nTravis Miller: Good morning, everyone.\nRejji Hayes: Hey Travis.\nTravis Miller: Not to be laver this here, but going back to Slide 12, again, and just want to triple check, I'm understanding. So the $0.19 you have saved so far this year, and then going over to the right side of the $0.10. Are those the same number such that when you talk about redeploying operating costs or anything other - any other savings that the $0.19 done for the muted $0.10 for the full-year, or is there something else going on I\u2019m not understanding?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so just to be clear, Travis, so in the first half of the year, that $0.19, remember that is a comp relative to 2019. And so you have a few things flowing through that from non-operating savings, you can see some flex and work optimization. The $0.10 that you see on the right hand side that aligns with the 65 million that Patti noted or released a good portion of it that we have identified and realize to-date, and so that is what you see in the year to go is really the vast majority of the 65 million of operating cost savings that we have delivered through the CE Way. So, the lean operating system, supply chain, a little bit of work mix that was favorable as we take own resources over to capital projects, particularly during the shoulder months, and we were quite effective at that. And so that $0.10 is largely the 65 million again that Patti noted in her prepared remarks.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Very good. And is there a scenario where if you continue to have the favorable weather, then you could actually have that number come down such that you pull ahead or cost than you might have incurred in 2021or 2022, as you have in the past years.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, that is great. That is right Travis. We definitely pull ahead those savings and when we can prepare for 2021. And so to get really specific $0.19 plus the $0.10 that is all opportunity. And so when you look at our Slide 6, which is what I sometimes refer to as the swish-swish slide, it is the roller coaster slide. We will, as the year materializes have options about how to deploy those savings, whether they are to the benefit of this year or to the benefit of 2021 and 2022. So we are definitely in forward planning right now for next year on how best to de-risk 2021 with the upside that we have identified through these cost savings.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. I appreciate. That is all I had.\nPatricia Poppe: Yes, thanks.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey guys. Good morning. A lot of discussion. I just have one question. Going back to these O&M savings. How should we think about how are they handled in your ongoing rate cases? Are there - so Patti you mentioned 2021. So as we think about 2021, should we assume that this will be reflected in your rate plans? In other words, some of this or most of this goes back to the customers, how you sort of dealing with that in your ongoing rate cases?\nPatricia Poppe: Yes. Because we have forward looking ratemaking we always align our rates in our O&M. So, internally when our rate cases approved, then we align the spending to match it. And so when we have favorability or we have cost savings that are in addition to what is in a rate case in year, then in that current year we may have a short-term benefit of that. But that is why we will take those short-term benefits and reinvest them, for example, trim more trees or do more maintenance or pull ahead some expenses from next year. But we are always because of that forward-looking test year, we really are able to align our spending and our rate outcomes.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. I appreciate it guys. Great quarter. Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this includes the question and answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Patti Poppe for final remarks.\nPatricia Poppe: Thank you, Rocco. Great to be with everyone today. Thanks so much for tuning in. And please be safe and be well. I hope you and your families are able to come together and be healthy during this very challenging time.

            "name": "Patricia Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call everyone it is great to be with you. This morning I will discuss our strong first half results and the actions we have taken to adapt to the challenges in the current year, while keeping an eye on delivering our long-term growth in 2021 and beyond. Rejji, will add more details on our financial results, including impacts related to COVID-19 and offsets we are seeing from the CE way among other items. And as always, we will close with Q&A. For the first half, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.35 up 25% from the same period in 2019. Our first half results were primarily driven by best-in-class cost management, favorable sales mix and timely regulatory recovery as we continue to respond to the ongoing and ever changing circumstances presented by COVID-19. As we have demonstrated through our commitment to the triple bottom line and the CE way, we can tackle unsurpassed extreme challenges, operationally and financially presented by this pandemic and its resulting economic impact. Given the better visibility we have on the pandemic and Michigan's economy reopening, we are pleased to reaffirm our adjusted guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68 with a bias to the midpoint. We continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Again, with a bias to the midpoint. While ESG has been a more prominent topic recently. For us it is nothing new. Our long-term thesis is built and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people planet and profits underpinned by performance, which is our way of talking about and activating ESG in our decision making processes. It starts with people, of course, our co-workers, our customers and the communities that we serve. We continue to provide an essential service during these unpredictable times, while keeping our co-workers safe. Through smart work practices, including working-from-home, direct to job site reporting, social distancing, in our work locations and ensuring we have adequate testing and PPE. During this pandemic, the social awakening and the local flooding in Midland, Michigan. We have leveraged our foundation to support our customers and communities. Our ability to respond and deeply care for our coworkers and communities is made possible through the diverse team we have here at CMS Energy. We have maintained a strong commitment to diversity at CMS for many years. And this is reflected in the makeup of our Board and our Management team. But our work is far from complete, which is why I'm excited about our recent promotion of Angela Tompkins as our Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer. While all of us owns the efforts to improve Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at all levels. Angela's leadership will be vital for us now and in the future. Angela co-authored our DENI strategy in conjunction with the senior management team over the past several years. As a result of this focus, we were prepared for this time and the important conversations that are underway inside our company and nationwide. Our focus on the planet has not wavered. We have net zero plans for both our gas and electric businesses, which are among the most aggressive in the industry, both in terms of magnitude and timing. While our efforts in the future are ambitious, including over six gigawatts of added solar over the next 20-years, I would like to remind folks, we have already made an enormous amount of progress with the closure of our seven of our 12 coal plants, with the next two scheduled for closure in 2023. In addition to new renewable, we are replacing our retiring capacity with new and innovative solutions, such as our demand response program we ramped up this year, with our first of its kind partnership with Google to offer 100,000 Nest thermostats free to our customers. We believe in a clean and lean energy future and we plan to lead the way. All our efforts and success wouldn't be possible without the capital you provide. So that last piece for profit is always top of mind. As you can see in the numbers, and as we are highlighting for you this morning, our co-workers have been busy since we last updated you successfully identifying over $65 million of operating cost reductions since the pandemic began. In addition to a variety of year-over-year savings totaling $0.19 year to-date, and our foot is on the gas. Our lean operating system provides the ability to create reductions like these in the current year, and enable delivering in the years to come as the savings carry forward. And backed by popular demand, it is time for my story of the month. This one comes from our Jackson Generating Station where twice a year we replace couplings that helped maintain lubrication on each of the six gas engines there. So that is 12 replacements over the course of the year. Now, while this is often routine work, the team at the plant didn't just follow the routine. They brought their 18-years of on the job experience to the table and recommended an alternative coupling, which had the same performance and life expectancy but as a fraction of the cost. The team took ownership with the CE Ways as they propose this cost saving idea. This simple but important change lead over $30,000 of annual savings. Now, some of you may be saying Patti, come on $30,000 is not a lot of money. But what you forget is that there are thousands of stories like this across our company. And when you add up nickels and dimes, you get dollars in size. So I would like to give a shout out to my three co-workers who made this happen Ted, Dave and Bush thank you guys for taking full ownership of our Company's financial and operational targets, and delivering for all of our stakeholders. This is just one example of how our co-workers are feeling empowered to apply the CE Ways to their everyday work and ultimately improving performance throughout the whole company. The visual on Slide 6, my personal favorite serves as another reminder of our team's ability to adapt to deliver the financial results you have come to expect, regardless of the headwinds. 7% EPS growth every year is not an accident. We wrote the book on adapting to changing conditions and delivering results in the current year that enable next year success. Consistency is our Hallmark. And this year is no different. We continue to ride that roller coaster and it has been a wild ride so far this year, so that you can count on the predictable EPS and dividend growth you have come to expect. Looking to regulatory matters. Commissioner Dan Scripps was recently named Chair of the Public Service Commission here in Michigan. He has taken over for Commissioner Talberg, who is being considered for a new role at the Ercot Board beginning in January 2021. We want to thank Tally for her leadership and look forward to continuing to work with her through the remainder of her time on the Commission. We congratulate Dan Scripps as he transitions into his new role. We will remind you that the Commission ordered utilities to defer uncollectible accounts and track those expenses above what is currently approved in rates which speaks to our constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. We are thankful to be able to work with the Commission to serve our customers in a caring way during this very uncertain time. We also have pending Gas and Electric rate cases and the MPFC staffs position in both demonstrate great alignment with our capital investment plan and rate base growth. We expect an order in our gas case in October and on our electric case by the end of the year. Thanks to low price commodities. Our cost saving capability and no big bets investment philosophy. We can both invest in safety, reliability and resilience of our infrastructure and protects customers from price spikes and surprises through tough economic times like these. The needs of our system do not change, because of a global pandemic and our customers' expectations don't either. Our business model allows us to serve both. Now turning to enterprises, where I'm pleased to highlight the measured growth of our contracted renewables business. As you may have seen last week, we acquired a majority ownership of a 525 megawatt contracted wind project. Construction of the project is largely complete and has an expected commercial online data set for later this month. The project will offer utility like returns and is largely committed to Facebook and McDonald's as customers. The bulk of the project is being financed with tax equity, and the remainder will be financed with cash-on-hand from our upsize hybrid offering and without the need to issue incremental equity beyond our plans $250 million this year. This project continues our track record of developing renewables for key corporate customers, while minimizing risk and providing attractive returns to complement our existing portfolio of assets, including DIG. Thanks, Rejji. Our team is committed to delivering for customers and you, our investors. The capital you provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. We remain good stewards of our balance sheet with prudent planning and already this year we have executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. We continue to rely on the CE Way and lean into their lean operating system we have in place. And as a result, we improve both our cost structure and our customer experience each and every day. Michigan continues to remain a top tier regulatory jurisdiction with forward looking test years and 10-month rate cases, we are fortunate to have much constructive regulatory framework in statute. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. We are fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs retiring. None of this comes at a price to our planet, and our home state of Michigan. Our net zero carbon and methane plans remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well and that is why the thesis remains strong. And that is why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this ongoing pandemic, just as it has in the past and will do in the future. With that Rocco, will you please open the lines for Q&A? Great. Good morning to you. Good morning, Jonathan. Yes, Jonathan that is embedded in $0.19 year-to-date savings. But part of the $65 million will carry through and be realized as the year progresses. So there really is sort of apples and oranges. But let me be clear about a couple things. $55 million is definitely not the finish line. And again, as you have noted, it doesn't reflect all of the year-over-year savings year-to-date. The team's identified $65 million in operational cost reductions so far this year. And so when we add in other year-over-year additional non-operational savings, that is again, what Rejji's point about $0.19 year-to-date. But again, that is not the full-year number. And it is a little bit apples and oranges. But one of the things to remind you is that, our best ever performance was $0.15 for a full-year. We talked about that in Q1. And so you can see why we are so proud of this team. And why I'm glad that we started preparing for this year four years ago when we launched the CE Ways. You can't make a friend when you need one. And it takes time. And so I'm grateful that we are launching a cost savings program this year. We are relying on our friends, the CE Ways, and she is delivering record levels this year right on time. So, I would be happy to give some additional color to that. But just like the story of the month, that literally is happening all over the company. And it is been four years in the making so proud of the team. Yes, it is a great question, Julian, because we are thinking about it all the time. Rejji talked about the $0.10. And so that is sort of in our pocket in the event of greater risk as the year progresses, but we are always redeploying cost savings back into the business. So it is never a question of what is sustainable for us or whether we are constantly finding those savings. We are constantly eliminating waste and then we redeploying those savings as needed. What is cool about these smaller savings and the way we do it is it gives us optionality. We will improve the number of miles trimmed for example per dollar or reduce the cost per visit service replaced. But then if we can trim more trees or replaced more services we will whether that is in the current year, because we have got favorability or in the future year because in fact, we pull ahead work. So, we have got $0.19 year-over-year cost savings or about $75 million, which again, that is not an accident. We are in the process of planning for 2021. But the key is like every year, we maintain a significant amount of flexibility to manage our business to meet both the commitments to customers. And to you, our investors and great analysts like Julian, you know we ride this roller coaster so that no one else has to. Everyone else, all of you get to toe on those consistent, predictable outcomes because we are making those choices year-in and year-out. So, now when we look at what we have achieved year-to-date and expect for the rest of the year. Quite a bit of that can carry over into next year. But again, we always fine tune and in a particular year we aligned the plan also to our what is in rates. So, we are just continuing to conclude our rate cases which we will be able to align with our approved plans, and then our cost savings can be deployed as required. Is that helpful? Great question, Julian. I will start and then I will let Reggie add some more of additional details. The key criteria for us as we look at these opportunities. They are always opportunistic, given the market conditions, given the demands, we need to make sure that three things are true. Number one, that they are customer driven. We aren't doing one-off auctions to acquire assets. We are not way back in the development phases of projects. We are working with customers to have a repeatable business. And so for the example of Aviator wasn't an option. We knew the developer and these customers have a desire to grow their renewable energy and we are in a great position to further those needs. It is a key component of the planet part of our triple bottom line. Number two, they have to had utility like or better returns, our utility business has a lot of demands for capital, it is got a lot of opportunity for growth. So, a project like Aviator has to compete with other utility projects. Given that the bulk of our growth for the company is driven by the utility. These projects have to be really good for them to get a yes from us here. Number three, they need to not add risk to the consolidated business. So, this project, for example, has two high quality credit worthy off takers. You saw in the press release McDonald's and Facebook, the term of the PPAs are greater than 10-years. So, that is a good example of an opportunistic project that came to us, because we have got a reputation of being able to close the deal and operate it well. And when it meets that criteria, then we continue looking at it. And so when we think, though about the long-term growth of the company to your question about the role it plays in six to eight, the enterprises business plays about a 5% of our earnings now. We don't expect to have n-regulated growth beyond that 10% of our total Company portfolio. So, the bulk of our growth is utilities. That is our bread and butter. That is what we focus the bulk of our time on. But where enterprises can grow with the utility doing what we do well, which is operate renewable projects and we serve customers well, then it is a nice compliment to the - and a portion a - piece of that 6% to 8%. Thanks, Julian. Good morning Andrew. Well, I will just get to the latter half of your question, Andrew. We expect that we will be able to redeploy funds this year, for the benefit of customers, and we are always planning for next year. So, we just want to make sure that we always and we have great capability to deploy those funds as required and pull ahead expenses and so we have got ample time between now and year end to make those adjustments. And we have had some success with some regulatory treatment, near year end where we can push forward some programs and some benefits for customers into future years. And so we really think that there is a good opportunity for us to leverage any favorability that we would have this year to serve customers and investors. Our customers love that and so do we. You know it is a creative option leveraging those deferred income taxes and so certainly would be open to considering it. We will keep looking at it. We have got good alignment with the staff on both our electric and our gas cases they are both in flight as we speak. And so we would look at it. But I will remind you that we don't object to annual filings for two reasons. Number one, it allows us to flex the Capital Planning, all of our rate cases are forward looking. And so as needs of the system change, as conditions emerge and because we don't have a big bet capital plan, we can modify our plan on manual basis to best reflect the greatest needs for customers. And so that is important to us. But I would also say that our rate cases are also opportunities to pass on cost savings to customers. And so when we think about the last seven years, for example, we have invested $15 billion of capital and our electric bills are down 5% and our gas bills are down 30%. I mean, that is the math that backs-up our business model that says, we can invest capital, particularly capital that saves customers money in the transition to cleaner energy and the reduction of these large PPAs that are coming forward. Skipping rate cases actually prevents us from passing along savings to customers. So we certainly are taking a look at the deferred income tax and perhaps delaying a case, but it isn't necessary for us to protect the affordability for our customers. Yes. Thank you. Good morning Shar. Hi Mike. Thanks, Michael. Hey. Jeremy. Thanks, Jeremy. Yes, that is great. That is right Travis. We definitely pull ahead those savings and when we can prepare for 2021. And so to get really specific $0.19 plus the $0.10 that is all opportunity. And so when you look at our Slide 6, which is what I sometimes refer to as the swish-swish slide, it is the roller coaster slide. We will, as the year materializes have options about how to deploy those savings, whether they are to the benefit of this year or to the benefit of 2021 and 2022. So we are definitely in forward planning right now for next year on how best to de-risk 2021 with the upside that we have identified through these cost savings. Yes, thanks. Yes. Because we have forward looking ratemaking we always align our rates in our O&M. So, internally when our rate cases approved, then we align the spending to match it. And so when we have favorability or we have cost savings that are in addition to what is in a rate case in year, then in that current year we may have a short-term benefit of that. But that is why we will take those short-term benefits and reinvest them, for example, trim more trees or do more maintenance or pull ahead some expenses from next year. But we are always because of that forward-looking test year, we really are able to align our spending and our rate outcomes. Thank you. Thank you, Rocco. Great to be with everyone today. Thanks so much for tuning in. And please be safe and be well. I hope you and your families are able to come together and be healthy during this very challenging time. We do look forward to seeing you face-to-face someday we can't wait and we miss you all. Thanks so much for tuning in."

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Patti. And good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $139 million which translates to $0.49 per share. Our second quarter results were $0.16 above our Q2, 2019 results largely due to cost performance, favorable weather and rate relief net of investment related costs utility. Our non-utility business performed as expected. As EnerBank had increased origination volume and enterprises had planned outages at its [indiscernible] facilities. Our adjusted earnings for the quarter exclude select non-recurring items primarily related to severance and retention costs associated with the pending retirement of our coal facilities and expenses resulting from a voluntary co-worker separation program, both of which commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019. Year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $384 million or $1.35 per share up 25% from the same period in 2019 as Patty noted. All-round we are tracking as planned and navigating the impacts of the pandemic by delivering on cost reduction initiatives and planning conservatively. As highlighted during our first quarter call, we are closely monitoring our electric sales of the utility, which has historically been our most sensitive financial metric during economic downturns, particularly in the commercial industrial segments. At the end of April when we were in the initial stages of the pandemic, with extensive social distancing measures in place statewide, and most businesses closed, we experienced significant declines in our commercial, industrial normalized load, while residential load increase as people stay at home. I'm pleased to report that with a phase reopening of Michigan's economy over the past few months, C&I Electric sales have begun to recover, particularly in the higher margin commercial segment. And what we are witnessing in Michigan is that while businesses reopen they are maintaining high levels of mass tele-working, which drives power consumption at homes during business hours. So our residential sales have remained elevated while commercial industrial sales are starting to return to their pre-pandemic levels. Our normalized low trends for the quarter reflects some of this, we are even more encouraged by what we have observed in July, given the visibility afforded by our smart meter technology. The bar chart on the upper left hand side of Slide 11, highlights our year-to-date normalized load trends, which show total electric sales down about 5% exclusive of one large low margin customer. However, the aforementioned favorable sales mix has largely mitigated the year-to-date decline in normalized load. And I will remind you that every 1% change in residential sales equates to over $0.03 of EPS impact on a full-year basis. And our combined electric and gas customer contribution skews towards the residential segment. Our sales outlook for the full-year reflects a sustained level of favorable mix in residential sales up around year-to-date levels and with conservative assumptions around the recovery of the commercial industrial segments. Lastly, given that the Corona Virus is not yet fully contained. The low end of our sales outlook range incorporates a stress scenario, which assumes a second wave during the latter part of the year. Switching gears to EPS. You can see the key items impacting our financial performance relative to 2019 and our waterfall chart on Slide 12. If I could summarize in two words the key driver of our financial performance in the first half of 2020, it would be cost performance. As noted in the table on the left-hand side of the page, as Patty noted, we delivered $0.19 of positive variance versus 2019 by reducing operating and non-operating costs throughout the business, which more than offset the $0.07 of negative variance due to weather in the first half of the year, and the C&I sales degradation and emerging costs directly attributable to the pandemic. It is also worth noting that the levels of cost savings achieved and just the first half a year exceed previously referenced historical levels of cost performance over the past 10-years. As we step into the second half of the year, as always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case implies $0.07 of negative variance versus the prior year. We are also assuming a constructive outcome in our pending gas case, which equates to $0.02 per share of pickup. Lastly, we are ever mindful of a potential resurgence of the virus in Michigan, and other common sources of risk to our business such as mild weather and storms. As such, we are planning conservatively by continuing to deliver on our cost reduction initiatives to establish sufficient contingency to any of the aforementioned risks arise. You can see on the table on the right hand side of the page, RS into the potential EPS impacts of the forecasted sales range I referenced on the prior slide, which, as noted incorporates a potential second wave in Michigan, as well as additional expenses related to the pandemic, which we estimate at $0.09 per share in aggregate. To offset these potential cost and potential risks. We are on-track to deliver another $0.10 per share of cost savings, which is further supported by an additional $0.10 per share of weather related tailwinds that we have observed in our July electric sales. This Slide path provides good financial flexibility heading into the final five months of the year to mitigate risks that emerge in 2020, while beginning to de-risk 2021 and beyond through operational costs pull ahead and other means to the benefit of customers and investors. Now on the capital, our customer investment plan remains on-track for the year as we have continued to make progress on our numerous electric and gas supply and infrastructure projects, while keeping our co-workers safe, by adhering to the CDC guidelines. We are often asked whether we have seen disruptions in our supply chain for renewable projects and I'm pleased to report that we remain on-track on all fronts. In fact, our Gratiot and Hillsdale wind farm projects, which will collectively supply over 300-megawatts and help us meet Michigan 15% renewable standard by 2021 on course for commercial operation in 2020. Generally, we continue to make progress towards the 1100-megawatts of new solar supply through build transfer agreements and contracted solutions by 2024. As a reminder, this represents the first tranche of the 6000-megawatt program that Patti noted as approved in our integrated resource plan in June of last year. Longer term, our current plan calls for approximately 12 and a quarter billion dollars of customer investments over the next five-years, and supports rate based growth of 7% over that period. This capital plan reflects the continued monetization of our electric and gas infrastructure, as well as increase investments to de-carbonize our electric generation assets. We will also remind you there a five-year customer investment plan is not limited by the needs of our system, but instead buy balance sheet constraints, workforce capacity and customer affordability. To elaborate on the point around customer affordability as we work toward delivering on cost reduction initiatives in 2020. Our bias remains toward projects that deliver sustainable savings to create long-term headroom and customer bills. As you will note on Slide 14, our $5.5 billion cost structure offers ample opportunities to reduce costs through the exploration of high price PPAs. the retirement of our full fleet capital enabled savings as we modernize our electric and gas distribution systems, and the continued maturation of the CE Way. The long-term headroom created in our electric and gas bills by these efforts will support our substantial customer investment needs of the utility to the benefit of customers and investors. You can see the long-term effects of our historical cost reduction efforts in the chart on the right hand side of the slide, which illustrates how we have managed to keep customer bills low on an absolute basis and relative to other household staples in Michigan law investing over $17 billion of capital over that timeframe. As I have said in the past, paying $5 to $6 per day, for clean, safe and reliable electricity natural gas is an extraordinary value proposition due in no small part to our cost discipline and triple bottom line mindset. Switching gears to our financing plan, we are quite active in the second quarter, opportunistically tapping the market to complete the vast majority of our planned financings for the year. From an equity financing perspective we announced our Q4 call, our plan to issue up to $250 million of equity all of which is priced under existing equity for contracts. And we exercise $100 million of that capacity late March with the remaining $150 million tranche still outstanding. We also filed a perspective supplement during the quarter for $500 million to refresh our ATM program, which is intended to cover our equity needs over the next three years. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help de-risk the future. We have also maintained a healthy bias toward liquidity management, with over $3 billion of net liquidity available in the event the capital markets become choppy again. As we look ahead, we will continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodative market conditions when they emerge. And with that, I will pass it back to Patti for some closing remarks before we open up the lines for Q&A. Hey, James. Yes, James, good question. So, we did take that into account. And so I will point you to Slide 11, where we show the downside range embedded in our full-year forecast in the lower left hand corner of the page. And so you can see we are taking into account a potential second dip and a stress scenario and so that shows commercial backing up to around 12% on full-year basis, which obviously means that the latter two quarters will be quite bad. And then you can see industrial at 18%, again on the low end. And that excludes one large low margin customer, which would even make that number a little lower. And so we are taking that into account. And I will also point you to the next slide, Slide 12, we estimate what that margin impact will be at $0.07 of EPS dilution. We are also mindful of the potential emerging costs that may come around if there is a second dip. And so we are taking into account quarantine related expenses, potential sequestration related costs and we think that that is probably another $0.02. And so all in we think there is about $0.09 of EPS related delusion in the event, there is a double death. And so when we look at July sales based on our smart meter data coupled with our cost savings that we feel very good about achieving over the second half of the year, we feel like we have sufficient cushion to stomach that downside case. Now obviously, it is a pandemic and so you this is unprecedented, but we feel good about the road ahead just based on our current calibrations. Thanks. Hey. Yes, sure. I would say it is been a very nice progression. If you think about the months in Q2, obviously April, I would say represented the bottom bottoming out. And so as we highlighted in our Q1 call where we had pretty good visibility on April, we were down about 20% to 25%. And then as we progressed into May and June, we saw a very nice progression as the state reopened. And so first you had the industrial sector start to come back around mid-May, and then non-essential retail shortly thereafter. And so with the graduate reopening of the state, we are now seeing C&I levels really come in. And so to give you a data point, for June for commercial, we were about 9% down. And we were basically 20% to 25% down in April. So, there is been a nice recovery and the July trends at this point, it is early days, and so I really try not to overreact to Smart Meter data, but we are looking at about 90% to 95% of pre-pandemic levels for our commercial industrial sales. And so there is been a very nice, gradual recovery month-over-month, over the course of Q2 and now into July. So we are cautiously optimistic. And you can see that reflected in the full-year forecast. But needless to say, we plan conservatively. And so in the event, there is a double dip, twin peak, whatever you want to call it. We are going to make sure we have enough cost savings and other sources of contingency to mitigate that risk. Is that helpful, Jonathan? Yes, Julian, the only thing I would add to Patti's good comments. Patti mentioned in her prepared remarks that there was a slug of tax equity. And that was not an insufficient slug. And so, if you look just on the surface and see 525 megawatts and then apply what you think is the standard cost per kilowatt, you can think the investment is quite sizable, but again, there is a pretty material slog of tax equity. And we are also a joint owner of the common equity for lack of a better characterization. And so, this really is not all that significant and investment from our perspective. In fact, it is quite comparable to the size investment we did for Northwest Ohio a year and a half ago. And so, we are being as Patti noted, opportunistic. We are trying to hit singles and doubles here. We are not swinging into fences. And so, we will approach this as the type of business where again it can be I think here where it is complimentary or supplement our portfolio, but again, we are not triples in homerun here. Yes. So, Andrew, I will take the last part of your question first. I mean, at the end of the day we do not intend to have a bunch of lazy capital sitting on our balance sheet. And so we fully expect the $3 billion to come down quite a bit by the end of the year. But again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks we are biasing towards liquidity management because the viruses and get contained. And so in the event, there is increased or continued volatility in the capital market, we want to just make sure we have sufficient liquidity. Now, as you think about the components on page 15. You can see from a first mortgage bond perspective at the OPCO, we are well in excess of what we hadn't planned at $1.2 billion But I will just note that there are a couple of maturities that we are dressing that will make those numbers look a bit more normalized. And so we have a term loan that you can see that we have yet to repay again, in the interest of just erring on the side of extra liquidity, particularly given the relatively low cost. And so that is a $300 million term loan. We also pulled forward a maturity at the OPCO in 2022 that had a five handle and so a very nice bit a positive carry in that trade. And so you take the two of those together that year-to-date, first mortgage bond issue to-date looks much more normalized relative to what we have in plan. And again, thinking about that same logic at the HoldCo. We did the hybrid, which is a lot higher than what we anticipated. But that is again, we have some flexibility in prepaying a term loan before it comes due or as it comes due. So I wouldn't overreact. We have just been opportunistic and really, again, erring on the side of liquidity. But again by the end of the year, I would be surprised if we were at that level of excess liquidity again by year in particular given the capital needs we have at the utility. Yes, so the quick answer is we feel quite good about the contingency that we have expect to have accumulate over the - particularly when you take July weather. So, you have effectively some excess contingency based on the numbers we are seeing. What I will note that just for full clarity is that cost savings as you can see - there is a lot more than just the items we have enumerated in that table. And so it is a hodgepodge of things. But we just highlighted here what we think is most noteworthy. And again we have taken into account in this math in the table, a stress scenario which obviously is in our base case, what we are seeing even in the event that we start to see margin erosion for commercial industrial like we on Page 11 - we still think that couples with cost that both could come again, if you have a second wave, we feel like we have generated and will generate enough cost savings, as well as with the July weather where we have sufficient contingency. But, Patti, if you would like to add to that, by all means, Thank you. Yes, so I can tell you the [Indiscernible] and thanks for the question. So as Patti noted, I think we evaluate all these projects, when we are looking at capital allocation across the company. Because it is quite competitive internally. We make sure that the returns are comparable to those of the utility if not better. And so we feel quite good about the economic profile of this project. And again, as Patti noted, we also want to make sure that we are not ascribing a lot of terminal value to these types of projects. And that there is very good credit worthy uptick. And we feel like this project checks those boxes. Now, we do not conflate utility capital investments with these types of projects in the $2.25 billion that we highlighted in our Q4 2019 call. We are still on-track to deliver that. And this is again opportunistic, it is not changing our financing plan, as Patti noted. And so, we feel like this is a nice opportunity to take advantage of. It is not a triple or a homerun, it is a single or double and this aligns with how we would like to evaluate and take on projects like this going forward. Hey Mike. Yes, it is more to form. I mean, we have always had a good balance of NOLs and credits. But we do see a little bit of accretion in that balance because of some of the renewables we expect. So that is larger, but that is Michael. Yes, where we sit at this point, we don't expect to be really a meaningful federal taxpayer until around 2024. And so our sense is that tax equity will likely be this financing vehicle for some time. Yes, I will say it is attractive. as you know obviously, it is not as cheap as a debt - plain or common debt financing. But also, it is not as expensive as traditional common equity. And so it is in between and we think the rates that we have negotiated for this particular transaction are quite competitive. No. like I said this a pretty meaningful slug of tax equity that is been in this project and for other projects that we evaluate from time-to-time. We haven't seen any contraction in the market for tax equity, but we will see. I mean, obviously, if there is another bit of volatility in the market, because there is a double dip or twin peak, whatever you want to call it, now market may back up for now, it is been quite accommodative. Yes, I wouldn't say it is that, I wouldn't say our financial planning is that prescriptive. Again, we intend to be opportunistic on these types of projects. And so we are assuming I think, a modest level of additional project flow and that is where you see again a modest bit of credit accretion. So again, we are not swinging for the fences here and assuming that there is going to be material increase in our NOLs or our credit specifically because of projects like this. Sure. I think the quick answer is the bank is on-track. And so we have got it to $0.18 to $0.20 for the full-year and they are on course to deliver that. Now, you will see for the quarter, and for the period-over-period comp, they were behind by about a penny that was per plan, because they started the year quite well. And obviously we have implemented the new accounting standard current expected credit losses and so that has a material impact on the provision for loan losses. And so when you comp it to 2019 you may see in the third quarter a little bit of leakage quarter-over-quarter. But we are fully on-track we have continued to see very good origination volume across most of the projects that we provide financing for and I think June was a historical month of loan approvals and loan originations. And so we are trending on plan and really haven't seen much backup, but for I would say April to for a little period of time. Thank you. Hey Travis. Yes, so just to be clear, Travis, so in the first half of the year, that $0.19, remember that is a comp relative to 2019. And so you have a few things flowing through that from non-operating savings, you can see some flex and work optimization. The $0.10 that you see on the right hand side that aligns with the 65 million that Patti noted or released a good portion of it that we have identified and realize to-date, and so that is what you see in the year to go is really the vast majority of the 65 million of operating cost savings that we have delivered through the CE Way. So, the lean operating system, supply chain, a little bit of work mix that was favorable as we take own resources over to capital projects, particularly during the shoulder months, and we were quite effective at that. And so that $0.10 is largely the 65 million again that Patti noted in her prepared remarks. Thank you. Thank you."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through May 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Alison. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Patti Poppe, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Patti.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We hope that you're staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter results and long-term outlook, as well as provide an update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rejji will add more details on our financial results later and discuss sensitivities related to COVID-19. And as always, we'll close with QA. I'd like to start by acknowledging that this health crisis is affecting scores of people in really unimaginable ways. My heart is with each of you, and I know that there will be a post COVID. May your family and friends be stronger, closer and at peace when all of this is behind us. You know what always keeps my team and I anchored is our focus on the long-term, and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. We have a track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance and we have solid fundamentals in our favor that have served us well in years past and will enable us to navigate today and in the future. Now, let's get to the numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 in the first quarter, despite challenging weather conditions and the onset of this unprecedented global pandemic. Our first quarter results were $0.11 better than 2019 results for the same period, mostly driven by cost management, regulatory outcomes and our ability to adapt to changing conditions, whether it be the temperatures outside or adjusting to life under a stay at home order. As a stay home, stay safe order is still in place for Michigan and the situation is continuing to evolve, it's too soon to provide an update on our guidance we issued on January 30. So, given the fluidity of the situation, at this time, we're not changing our guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68.  Though the current circumstance is certainly challenging, our investment thesis remains intact and our business model resilient, both of which will support our long-term operational and financial objectives, as we continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Let's take a moment to get everyone up to speed on what we're seeing here in Michigan and what we're doing to lessen COVID related impacts on the communities that we serve. On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a stay at home order requiring all non-essential businesses to close until April 13, which has now been extended until mid-May with some loosening of retail and recreational restrictions previously in place. Schools are closed for the remainder of the academic year. Prior to the Governor's order, we established our Incident Command Structure or ICS. So, we were already functioning in our emergency response mode as conditions worsened, particularly in the southeast portion of the state. Early on, we retained a Chief Medical Officer to help guide our operational decision-making and ensure we could perform our necessary work safely. We instituted a travel ban for business activities and the necessary self quarantining for employees after any personal travel. We quickly transitioned to a remote workforce, and I'm pleased that the team responded with great agility. For team members and critical on-site operational roles including those working in control rooms, and that generating plants and natural gas compression stations, we've implemented numerous safety protocols following all CDC guidelines, including and in some cases sequestration. For the remaining workforce, our coworkers are either working from home or reporting directly to the jobsite from their homes to continue operations in the field and ensure their safety. At this time, we've experienced zero fatalities, and 11 of our over 8,000 coworkers, our work family have tested positive for COVID-19. Yet, we're thankful that seven of those coworkers have been able to return to work, and they each identified case has yielded fewer and fewer ancillary cases of contact, which means our social distancing is working. Our COVID-19 case rate is three times less than the broader Michigan rate. We believe that our safe work practices have been essential in protecting our coworkers from exposure to this virus. We're taking by-weekly poll surveys of our coworkers to see how they're doing during this time. And I'm very proud to report that over 90% of our team is satisfied with how we're handling the COVID-19 pandemic as a company. Our safety culture and commitment to our people has been a source of strength for all of us, and we'll remain deliberate in our efforts to keep our coworkers and our customers safe. Beyond safety, we know our customers are facing economic challenges and we've stepped up to support them. Some of the most deeply impacted at this time are our small business customers, who are the heart of Michigan's economic engine. When we get on the other side of this current crisis, and there will be another side, our small businesses will serve as an essential role in fueling the economy once again. We know and love these customers and understand the hardships they\u2019re going through, and they have tailored our services accordingly. We've redeployed our business customer care team to help our customers navigate the state and federal assistance programs. We trained our team on the federal and state funding available and created scripts and content specifically tailored to our small business customers. And on a personal level some of you may have seen, my husband Eric and I set up the Dream Maker Fund at the onset of the crisis with a personal contribution, which has provided emergency relief to our small businesses in Jackson, Michigan, where we live and where the company is headquartered. This has given us a front row seat on the small business impact of COVID-19 here in Michigan. The company and Consumers Energy Foundation have also taken a number of actions to help our vulnerable residential customers, including extending our payment protection plans through June 1, dispersing over a $1 million in grants and donations to facilitate the needs of our healthcare workers, supporting our local food banks and charities, as well as matching our coworkers donations to local charities. Needless to say, we haven't lost track of you our investors. We're mindful of the COVID related risks on our business. And we're always on the job identifying those risks and managing the work every year in every aspect of the business. We operate both in natural gas and electric business, and natural gas represents one-third of our revenues at the utility and is the fastest growing segment. The bulk of our gas business margin comes from our residential customers and is earned in the heating season which ended in March, and we expect residential gas sales to be normal in the fourth quarter. While our electric deliveries are certainly down year-over-year, we will remind you that we have a track record of mitigating financial risks given the inherent volatility in our business which I will cover on the next slide. We're grateful for the leadership and partnership our Public Service Commission has demonstrated. We're working together to make sure our coworkers are safe and our customers are cared for. The Commission is collecting and reviewing costs related to COVID-19, including uncollectible accounts and sequestration and quarantine related costs. The Commission established deferred accounting for uncollectible expense above what's currently approved in rates, which Rejji will elaborate on later and speaks to the constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. As we turn to slide six, we\u2019ll remind you that we've seen significant unforeseen challenges and double-digit EPS downside in previous years. In fact, in 2016 and 2017, we had as much as $0.13 and $0.16 of negative variance. And through conservative planning and a bottoms-up approach to cost management, we were able to deliver on our operational and financial objectives. With that said, as a result of anticipated COVID related financial risks this year, like most, we've implemented several cost control measures, such as a hiring freeze, reduced over time, and minimize travel and training expenses. Plus more sustainably, we\u2019ll rely on our ability to accelerate cost savings and waste elimination through our Consumers Energy Way to pursue our financial objectives without compromising customer service. Rejji will provide some of the sensitivities for the risks we've highlighted and potential offsets.  As we gain more visibility in Q2 and beyond, we'll adjust our plan accordingly to remain agile and make choices that mitigate the impact in 2020 and protect our long-term operational and financial performance. While we don't know the ultimate impact of COVID-19, we do know how to manage and operate a world-class business that delivers over the long-term. And that brings us full circle as we talk to you today. Our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged, despite the near term uncertainty presented by COVID-19. Over the years, we've been good stewards of the balance sheet, maintaining a healthy level of liquidity and we plan conservatively. We still have a large and ageing system and need a significant investment. We still have a constructive regulatory environment and we still have the CE way that enables us to serve our customers, while keeping their energy costs affordable. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you Patti, and good morning everyone. Let me first echo Patti's comments by wishing each of you and your loved ones safe passage through these trying times in which we live. As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2020. We delivered adjusted net income of $245 million or $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings excludes select nonrecurring items, primarily related to costs resulting from a voluntary coworker separation program which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the favorable reversal of an accrued expense related to tax reform. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.11 above our Q1 2019 results, largely driven by rate relief, the net investment related expenses of utility and solid cost performance throughout our business. Switching gears to the COVID-19 related financial risks, as Patti noted, we are ever mindful of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business and have begun to implement cost control measures to mitigate these risks. On slide nine, we've provided a summary of potential impacts, as well as several mitigating factors which should help reduce our exposure to some degree. First, I'll start with utility, which I'll remind you, represents over -- about 90% of our business. The effects of the pandemic in Michigan that Patti referenced have unsurprisingly reduced commercial industrial activity in the state, which has begun to materialize in our electric sales. Based on daily volumetric trends extracted from our smart meters over the past month or so, we've seen declines in weather normalized commercial industrial load of about 20% to 25%. The C&I load reduction has been partially offset by residential load, which is up over 5% over the same timeframe presumably due to mass teleworking and self quarantine measures.  As noted in the past, the residential customer segment offers our highest margins and represents over 60% of our customer contribution for electric and gas combined, which I'll discuss in more detail later. The other noteworthy financial risk, the utility, attributable with COVID-19 are potential increased costs and uncollectible accounts due to delays in customer payments and sequestration and quarantine related costs to ensure the safety of our coworkers. As mentioned, we are working hard to mitigate these risks and cost control measures and customer outreach programs. We also recently received an accounting order from the commission to apply to deferred accounting to uncollectible account expenses in excess of rates as Patti noted. And we will soon file a response to this initial order seeking approval to defer other costs related to COVID-19, including sequestration and quarantine related costs. As for non-utility businesses, which collectively represent about 10% of the earnings, the potential risks are largely on the revenue side and broadly speaking are fairly well mitigated. And enterprises a vast majority of its revenue streams are contracted at fixed prices with credit worthy counterparties. It is also worth noting that the Supreme Court of Michigan recently issued an order, upholding the MPSCs ability to enforce a local clearing requirement for all energy providers in the state. Longer term, this decision could create opportunities for DIG, given the favorable trends we've observed in the last two planning resource auctions in MISO for Zone 7 which just cleared the cost of new entry. With regards to EnerBank, the primary risk in the current environment are loan origination volume and a potential increase in charge offs. But it's important to remember that the business model EnerBank is unique. We are not underwriting mortgages or making auto or small business loans. EnerBank underwrites home improvement loans primarily to premium credit quality borrowers whose average FICO scores are above 750. This borrower base has proven to be relatively more resilient during economic downturns. And in fact, in 2008 EnerBank\u2019s originations increased given the relative inelasticity of its core borrower base and through market share gains at the expense of weaker capitalized competitors.  The final notable risk from an earnings perspective is in our parent and other segment, which is largely comprised of non-recoverable financing costs. I am pleased to report that due to proactive and cost effective liquidity management from our treasury team, we have no remaining maturities in 2020 and it fully priced our planned equity issuance needs for the year through forward contracts, which I'll elaborate on later. Circling back on the utility sales risk, which we've viewed the most substantial risk to our business in the current environment, slide 10 highlights the relative contribution mix of our customer segments and the load reductions we've witnessed since late March. As you'll note, the residential segment represents approximately 60% and 75% of the customer contribution for the electric and gas business respectively and over 60% of the total customer contribution at utilities I highlighted earlier. So, any uptick and growth in the residential segment should partially offset the expected declines we anticipate in the commercial and industrial segments. All-in, given the current sales trends we've observed since the public response to the pandemic, we estimate approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS dilution per month. As Patty noted, at this point, it's too early to tell how long and to what extent social distancing measures will remain in place or how strong the economic recovery in Michigan will be upon its conclusion. As such, we have provided this monthly sensitivity for your modeling purposes and we'll keep your breasts at any material changes to our plan. On slide 11 in our waterfall chart you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance relative to 2019. Despite an unusually warm winter which offered $0.23 of negative variance versus Q1 of 2019, the absence of the substantial service restoration costs due to storms we experienced last year, coupled with last September supportive gas rate order and cost performance throughout the business, delivered $0.11 of net positive variance versus the first quarter of 2019. Depending on the extent to which the financial risks of COVID-19 manifest, we believe the glide path illustrated on this slide could enable us to achieve our EPS guidance as we plan for normal weather and anticipate a constructive order and our pending gas case in mid-October. As mentioned, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on Michigan's economy and our business remains uncertain, so we have referenced the estimate monthly EPS dilution of $0.03 to $0.04 in the event the level of sales degradation that we have witnessed to date persists. Further, we will closely monitor the potential risk to our business, some of which have been mitigated through regulatory support. We have also added the historical range of annual financial risks that we have successfully mitigated over the past several years, which equates to approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share or $40 million to $70 million pre-tax. Clearly, we have a strong track record of managing the work and delivering cost reductions through our lean operating system the CE way and other initiatives. And as Patti noted, we've already implemented an initial wave of cost control measures. Needless to say, we are not here to represent that any downside scenario can be overcome, particularly given the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. However, we are confident that we can minimize the financial risk in 2020 without jeopardizing our long-term value proposition to our customers and investors. As we execute our risk mitigation strategies, you'll note on slide 12 that we have prioritized liquidity management and have over $2.3 billion of net liquidity available, which includes unrestricted cash and untaught -- untapped revolving credit facility capacity as of March 31.  We've always managed our balance sheet in conservative manner and so whether there've been a lot of concerns regarding access to the commercial paper market, I'll remind everyone that we do not rely on CP as a permanent layer of funding, nor do we have any outstanding at this time. As part of our funding strategy for the year, we put in place term loans to the parent and the utility for $300 million each and those don't mature until 2021. And in mid-March we issued $575 million of first mortgage bonds at a rate of 3.5%, which addressed our sole maturity across our debt issuing entities in 2020 and funds our capital programs.  From an equity financing perspective, we announced on our Q4 call, our plans to issue up to $250 million of equity, all of which is priced under existing equity forward contracts and we drew down approximately a $100 million of that capacity in late March. We expect future equity issuances can be completed through our ATM program, which we will likely refile in the coming months. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help derisk the future. As we look forward, we'll continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodated market conditions when they emerge. Highlight with our credit metrics on slide 13 which remained well above the thresholds for investment grade ratings among all three credit rating agencies. Our focused on maintaining a strong financial position coupled with a supportive regulatory environment and predictable operating cash flow growth supports our strong ratings, and we'll look to maintain our strong credit quality with an eye toward the future to the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing comments before we open up the lines for Q&A.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Rejji. My coworkers and I remained on the job every day for our customers and for you, our owners. We're focused on delivering an essential service to nearly 6.7 million of our fellow Michiganders. The capital you all provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. As I mentioned, we've been good stewards of our balance sheet, with prudent planning and our conservative liquidity management continues. Already for 2020 we executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. Our operational excellence shines through during times like these. As we continue to rely on the CE way and lean in on that lean operating system we have in place, we improve each and every day. We put to work efficiencies that drive down costs and eliminate waste. And I can tell you that system is in overdrive right now, which speaks to our agility as we shift accordingly depending on how this current environment evolves.  Since the 2008 energy law was established and updated again in 2016, Michigan has remained a top tier regulatory jurisdiction. With forward-looking test years and 10 months rate cases, we're fortunate to have such a constructive regulatory framework in statute. We also have a supportive commission. As you can see by the recent order responding to the pandemic for the protection of vulnerable customers while being mindful of utility, being able to fund its operations and attract low cost long-term capital. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades and that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. Again, we're fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs expiring. Finally, none of this comes at a price to our planet and the great state of Michigan we all love so dearly. Our net zero carbon and methane goals remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well. That's why this thesis remains intact and that's why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this current crisis just it has in the past and will do so in the future.  With that, Alison, will you please open the lines for Q&A?\nOperator: Thank you very much, Patti. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. One moment please. Thank you. And Shar, your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. \nShar Pourreza: Hey, good morning guys.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Shar.\nRejji Hayes: Morning.\nShar Pourreza: Couple of questions here. So, first off, you talked about the $0.03 to $0.04 impact per month based on the sales sensitivities that you provided on slide 10. You're obviously levelizing this, but should we expect any kind of peaks or troughs over the next two quarters? I mean, some utilities assume business closures in Q2, some return in Q3 and a bit more of a mean reversion in Q4. I know we're only two months into this, but just trying to get a sense on the monthly profile of your sensitivities you assume in plan or really what the guidance can withstand. Obviously, on slide four there seems to be a little bit of cautious language around the uncertainty of duration and the full impact of COVID. So I know -- what are your prelim thoughts even though it's very early stage?\nPatti Poppe: Shar, thanks for asking. We've tried to be really transparent here. We have a track record of offsetting negative impacts, the EPS, as you mentioned, ranging in as much $0.10 to 0.15. We also have a track record of transparency, which is why we've tried to be as direct and forthcoming as we can about the C&I sales that have dropped 20% to 25% versus expectations. And with then the offsetting residential sales up over 5%, the earnings impact, as you've mentioned and what we've said, is $0.03 to $0.04 per month under the current condition. Now, here's the variables. How fast will businesses bounce back? How soon will people gather in public spaces? How quickly will manufacturers be able to start making non-essential goods again? Our stay at home order is still in place till May 15. Will the government stimulus help so that the small businesses can come back after this? At this point, there's just too many unknowns, Shar. And so, while we'll continue to remain conservative, we don't feel that we know enough right now. And so I guess I would offer this thing. One thing you can count on us to do is to call it straight. We've never over promised and under delivered, and nor have we really under promised and over delivered. We do what we say. I'm comfortable in the fact that our long-term fundamentals are the same and our short term actions will stand the test of time. One of the things, Shar, I think about a lot is that our customers, our coworkers and our regulators will long remember how we handle these temporary times. I feel good about that because we're doing the right things and we like always are acting with the long-term in mind and the long-term outlook has not changed and our fundamentals remain sound. So, as we think about any adjustments we would make this year or any actions we would take this year, we're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so, we're balancing all of those factors and doing everything we can to serve the triple bottom line.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Let me just -- let's -- let's assume this is a little bit more protracted. Can you talk about sort of the incremental levers as you mentioned $0.12 to -- $0.10 to $0.15 of historical flex range on slide 11, do you have more?\nPatti Poppe: What I would say is our historical performance is a good indicator, but we've also -- now we're about four years into the CE Way and that thing is on overdrive. And our team is on the job. They're looking for waste elimination all across the organization. We have 1,254 projects already identified this year. Start the day, time reduction. Some of the things that we're doing now as a result of the crisis, such as jobsite reporting, are actually saving money. And so, it's both the combination of current factors. There's current environmental things that allow us to save money plus our CE Way and the waste elimination and our ability to deploy our team to as much long-term capital work are the kinds of ways that we see tackling this challenge in a sustainable way. We're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so the cost savings that we would do would only be those that don't do damage to the future. The one thing, we think about we're not going to pull out all the stops and do damage to future years to hit some kind of unreasonable outcome this year. We're going to be in it for the long haul. And I think that's why people trust us and invest in us. \nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, the volume reductions on the C&I side, the 20% to 25% reduction that you've seen since March. Can -- is that sort of auto, auto supplier related? what drove that?\nPatti Poppe: We have a limited exposure to auto, less than 2% tier one suppliers plus the automotive themselves to our margin. What we're seeing is more the stay home order closed all restaurants, it closed all retail other than non-essential retail like grocery. And so that's where we're really seeing a lot -- and small manufacturers that aren't making essential goods. As I mentioned, my husband and I did this fund and so we've had an opportunity to look at all of the applications just in Jackson County and it's a whole range of things, golf courses, restaurants, bakeries, retail, little manufacturing shops, welding shops. They're in a holding pattern right now, waiting for the order to be lifted. And some of those businesses, even after the order is lifted, will be affected by people's reticence to gather in groups. Others will get right back at it. And so, we see a balance between some of them just purely waiting for May 15, and they'll be back on it full time. And there'll be others that may have a demand reduction because of people's fear. And so, again, there's a lot of unknowns. And fortunately, our smart meter data is very accurate and we can see real-time what's happening and it helps us make better decisions and better choices.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. Thank you, guys. Stay safe and we'll see you soon.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research LLC. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Thank you. Patti, Rejji, Sri, hope you're all doing well and your families.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Steve. Good morning.\nRejji Hayes: Same to you Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Yeah. Good. So, just the first on the sales. That March to April data, do you have just an overall number across the - the overall sales change?\nPatti Poppe: Rejji, what's our total sales adjustment then?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah, so, we don't have -- if you're talking about post Q1 beyond March 31, we do not have a full read across all of our customers, because smart meter data\u2026\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nRejji Hayes: \u2026 [indiscernible] good portion of our customers are select classes of large industrial and commercial customers that do not have smart meter data available. We do get good anecdotal evidence from those customers and do get good visibility, but we don't get perfect information really until we get to the end of the quarter. So, there are some limitations in that. But I would say, Steve, going back to Patti's comments, the 20% to 25% we highlight here again that is not indicative of all of our customers, but it's a decent read for now for that monthly read that we've offered from late March through kind of mid to late April. So that's a -- again, it's not a every single customer, but it's a decent portion of them.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Yeah, just curious because when we've looked at regions, we're not really seeing any region down more than 10% or so, but obviously that doesn't get to individual states or territories. So, I'm just kind of trying to compare it to some of the regional data we've seen --?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, Steve, I would say 10% total is a decent bogey that -- for our customer base as well. You're in the neighborhood for sure.\nRejji Hayes: That's exactly right.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then on this $0.03 to $0.04 per month thing data, a lot of utilities have different per -- depending on the season, the earnings impacts of the same sales change can vary, like a summer month might be worth more than a shoulder month. So, could you just talk about the seasonality of that sensitivity and just thinking about it this year?\nPatti Poppe: Well, we always deal with seasonality and the weather and that's what we certainly -- weather and storms, we've done a good job overcoming. In this scenario, there are so many, I would suggest the bigger drivers than just the weather that seasonality is obviously clearly a variable, but not nearly as much as some of the unknowns associated with the rate the businesses return to action. I don't know, Rejji, you might want to add something to that though. Go ahead.\nRejji Hayes: The only thing I would add is that it's certainly the timing of this is -- somewhat fortunate because we do expect higher volumes as it starts to go a little warmer particularly in the residential class now. So, we'll see more industrial activity sort of as you get past those shoulder months. And so, the timing of this, I guess if you could it happen at any time, which you don't root for, this would be the time to have it. And so certainly there are greater expectations for load once you get beyond sort of the March/April timeframe.\nSteve Fleishman: Maybe I should have asked the question different.\nPatti Poppe: Well, I'll just chime in. One last thing, Steve, that one of the points that we recognize is that even after an order is lifted, it's likely -- and I'm hearing from a lot of businesses that they'll keep their staff, their people working from home if they can. And so that residential bump may continue into the summer months and obviously air conditioning load is a big driver in Michigan to sales in the summertime. And so, if all of those folks are still or if a lot of people are still working from home that obviously has a favorable impact in the summer months.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Maybe I should have just asked, do you have a summer/winter kind of rate differential, or is it pretty much the same rate all year?\nPatti Poppe: Generally the same rate all year.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nPatti Poppe: So, next year we'll be implementing a more of a summer peak rate, but it's generally about the same throughout the year.\nSteve Fleishman: Got it. Okay. And then one last question, just could you talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing so far on non-payments and kind of how notable that might be, any color there?\nPatti Poppe: We are watching that. The -- one of the things with the uncollectible accounts is they do lag. And so we can see to some degree, it's very early. If you can imagine, it's at a minim a 30-day lag so before we know if somebody didn't pay their bill. And so sometimes the uncollectible accounts really take almost three to six months to show up and to really be accounted for. And so, we're watching -- we're seeing a slight uptick, but it's early. It's -- we haven't even crossed all of the cycles for some of the customers. \nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Steve. Stay well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Weinstein: Hi. Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, just to follow-up on some of those last questions. Can you speak to how some of this will be handled in the ongoing rate changes? So, I can have an almost annual electric rate case and an ongoing case it was just saw in February. So, how does that case get updated for changes to load -- changes and changes uncollectible and everything?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah. The cases are filed. Our gas case we filed in December and our electric case we filed here in February. So, there's not a clean way to have a significant substantive change to sales and frankly it would be hard to do it because we have forward test years. So what sales figure would we predict? So, we expect that our rate cases will continue as planned and because we do annual filings in the future, if there's a permanent degradation to sales, then we would reflect it. But it's pretty hard to capture a temporary degradation in sales like the one we're seeing in any kind of active filing. The good news is that our commission has been very supportive, just a shout out to the Michigan Public Service Commission and all their folks for adapting so quickly to this changing condition. They've already started holding their meetings and conducting business remotely through webcast. They too have had a significant impact. So thanks to all of them for acting so quickly and working with us on this new order for the CV-19 costs as well as the uncollectible accounts and trying to make sure that we, as a utility, are in a position to serve our customers well, do what's right, care for our most vulnerable customers and know that we can still function in a strong financial position that that reflects the capital attraction that we need to demonstrate. And so, great partnership with the commission and all their team, working so hard to just figure out these unknowables together. \nMichael Weinstein: Gotcha. And could you contemplate lower capital spending, if necessary things drag on long enough. \nPatti Poppe: Yeah. Right now, we're not seeing that in the plan. And in fact, we're working hard to make sure that -- for example, our power plants because energy load and demand is down, are an economic reserve, a couple of our coal plants. And so that gives us an opportunity to pull ahead of capital outage at that plant earlier in the year than we had originally planned. So, I don't -- we don't have any plans in the near term to have any adjustment to our capital plan. In fact, we're going to really work hard to make sure we keep that plan on track. \nMichael Weinstein: Got it. And on DIG, just wanted to ask about the local clearing requirement. It doesn't look like the impact of that Supreme Court decision would probably have to [technical difficulty] itself beyond. I just wanted to make sure.\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, the -- it -- because DIG is basically fully contracted, it doesn't have any certain impact on 2020, minimal in 2021, but there could be some out year impact that could be beneficial. But again, just keep in mind the DIG is predominantly contracted as Rejji had mentioned with high quality off taker. We are pleased with the outcome of that order though, and shout out to our legal team took it all the way to, the Supreme Court of Michigan did a great job advocating for the Public Service Commission and their authority to require a local clearing requirement. The law that we worked so hard to pass back in 2016, that was a fundamental element of it to make sure that Michigan as a Peninsula Zone 7 has adequate supply to serve the load. And with our kind of hybrid retail open access 10%, it does put at risk reliability in the state. So very happy with that outcome and very thankful and proud of my legal team for the great work that they did. \nMichael Weinstein: Yeah. It looks good. Hey, one last question on AMT credits and acceleration and the stimulus bill, have you guys quantified that at all? \nPatti Poppe: Yeah. So, we've benefited -- and remember it's just a cash benefit, but about $30 million of AMT credits, we'll pull forward in 2020, that would have originally been refunded in 2021. Again, that just affects cash, not earnings in any way.\nMichael Weinstein: And that\u2019s all I have. Take care guys. Stay healthy.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Michael. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Julien Dumoulin Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Hey, good morning to you. Hope you all are well.\nPatti Poppe: Morning, Julien. You too.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Excellent. So, just wanted to follow-up. You all are maintaining your guidance. So when you think about the sales forecast that you're embedding in that, I understand the $0.03 to $0.4 here and sort of as a sensitivity, but what are you specifically thinking about in making that statement to reaffirm rather than withdraws? We've seen perhaps more so in other sectors. And to be even more specific about it, I think you've alluded to perhaps $0.15 or $0.16 of historical perhaps cost flexibility in your plans. Can you talk to that too as you think about what the latitude reaffirmed here?\nPatti Poppe: So, Julien and I know everyone wants precision in these uncertain times. And there's a reason why the word unprecedented is like the number one word in youth these days. We just haven't been here before. So, as we said, it's just too soon for us to update our guidance. And it would mean that we know exactly how to help -- how the health crisis ends, how the economy will look afterwards, and frankly we don't know. And so, there are reasons to believe in a bounce back. The federal stimulus is working or watching. It helps small businesses, but can the businesses get access to it? Construction, manufacturing, ag can bounce back quickly and work safely, but will there be demand? I talked to an office furniture CEO, most of the office furniture in the world is made right here in Michigan and I talked to one of the CEOs last week and they may be at all time highs because they save workplaces need to be reorganized and new furniture is going to be required or maybe none of us are reporting to an office ever again. There's just a lot of changes. Will there be a drive in residential electricity demand? We've talked about that already. Maybe there will be. The shelter in place order can be lifted, but how long will people feel -- will it be before people feel safe to congregate in a public gathering. I don't know. We don't know. But here's what we do know, Julien. We know that we need our coworkers healthy and motivated to do our capital plan and it's a good infrastructure plan that serves the people of Michigan. We need our regulators to trust that we're doing what's right and taking care of both our coworkers and our customers. We need our customers to be with us and to survive this pandemic and be open for business when it's over, which is why we're working so hard to serve them with new information and help them navigate the circumstances.  What we can do is continue to run this business and look to mitigate costs and risks as they come up and never lose focus. And as I mentioned earlier on the long-term fundamental they're solid, right? The fundamentals of the business are the same. How we handle it in this temporary condition, as I mentioned, will be long remembered and so the cost savings, additional cost savings, what we would do to mitigate it are all going to be with an eye on the future. We're not going to take short term risks on a tomorrow's performance. And so, we're going to do our darnedest, us, how we think and how we operate. Again, our CE way is a great source of comfort to me, because we've actually developed some real capability across the organization and just in overdrive as I mentioned. So, given all that, I would say, it's too soon to say, but trust me, we're not waiting on the sidelines to figure it out. \nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Got it. And then related question, super quick. I mean, you all are working proactively with the PSC here to address a recovery of certain items. How do you think about that being reflected again in numbers, specifically 20 here as you continue to move through the course of the year? I just want to be clear about that given some differences in the sector.\nPatti Poppe: Well, we're going to have to see. We'll be filing our response. They've asked for comments, which is a very important and constructive. We need to hear from a lot of people as we make these determinations. Once the accounting is clarified and we've got certainty about that, then we can account for it. And then we'll have benefits obviously in 2020. They've been pretty clear about the uncollectible expenses as a result of a mandate to not shut off our most vulnerable customers, our seniors and low-income through June 1. And so, they've been pretty clear about those uncollectible expenses and the accounting treatment thereof, but it's really some of the other expenses and exactly the timing of that uncollectible when it materializes et cetera. So, others will be weighing in, and certainly I can't speak for the MPSC, but I can just say that we're working together to make sure that we're able to serve the most vulnerable constructively.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: All right. Well, I'll leave it there. Thank you all very much.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks Julien. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrd: Hi. Good morning. \nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Stephen.\nStephen Byrd: Wanted to give congrats on all the community outreach efforts that you all are making. It looks like a lot of great stuff going on.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks.\nStephen Byrd: Wanted to -- a lot of my questions have been addressed, but just on the EnerBank side of things, could you just talk a little bit more about new business opportunities that you're seeing? I guess I'm certainly not a bank analyst, but I would have thought sort of home improvement activity would be going down a great deal, but I was just curious what you're seeing on certain new business.\nPatti Poppe: Well, I've been doing all the talking, so I'm going to hand it over to Rejji. He is the Chairman of the EnerBank Board. I'll let him speak about the great work that the EnerBank team is up to. Go ahead, Rejji. \nRejji Hayes: Thanks Patti. And good morning, Stephen. So Stephen, I would say that -- and that's certainly we did see a little bit of a slowdown in March on origination volume, but we've actually been encouraged with what we're seeing in April. And it's important to note a couple of things. So, every state has a different approach to the executive orders that have rolled out, but financial service is deemed an essential service and that's a federal mandate. And so, we've managed to continue our underwriting and also, construction projects that are work in progress or quipped. For all intents and purposes, those bits of work have also been permitted to continue on. And so, we really haven't seen the type of slowdown you would anticipate for some of the loans that EnerBank has historically underwritten.  So, I would say encouraged by what we're seeing in April unsurprisingly, a little bit of a slowdown in March. And we still think, they started the quarter off or the year off pretty well, about a penny above the prior year. And we're only asking for about a penny to two of growth year-over-year for them and they appear to be on track. And so, the other opportunities as you think about origination volume is also on the gain share side. And so what we've seen in the past, particularly in 2008/2009 is you had a lot of weaker capitalized competitors who kind of fell by the wayside. And we've already seen anecdotally some large customers come our way, because they know that EnerBank is in it for the long haul. This is their primary focus. And so, we've actually taken some share, which we also did in 2008/2009. And so, just existing originations and continuing to execute on our plan as well as taking share also create opportunities this year. And so, we feel good about the road ahead where we sit at this point. \nStephen Byrd: That's really helpful, Rejji. Thank you. And then just one other question on your 2020 EPS slide 11. More of a housekeeping item, but just you mentioned the historical flex range of $0.10 to $0.15 on that slide. And I just wondered what timeframe? Is that annual, is that for the nine months to go? I just want to make sure I understood that.\nPatti Poppe: Rejji, you can go ahead.\nRejji Hayes: Sure. Great. So, yeah, we look at that range and it's based on what we've done historically over the last several years. And so, we've seen that level of negative variance in a quarter. We've seen over the course of the year, but we've managed to and in historical context, overcome levels of flex of that magnitude or levels of negative variance of that magnitude. As I look at this year we certainly think that $0.10 to $0.15 year to go is certainly within us. And let's just think about what that math equates to. So, on the low end about $40 million pretax, on the high end call it $60 million to $65 million. And when you think about our year to go spend, we've got about a $1 billion of, I'll say, actionable opportunities between operating and non-operating cost pools. So that reduction equates to a little more than 5%, which is certainly within us. And so not to suggest it's easy and to Patti's earlier point, we're not going to do anything that's rash or detrimental to the years to come. And so, we do feel like it's within us, but at the end of the day we'll have to see how this situation in Michigan materializes, and we'll make prudent decisions as we always do.\nStephen Byrd: That's great. Thank you. That's all I have.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nPatti Poppe: Hi, Jonathan.\nOperator: One moment please. And Jonathan, your line is open. Please proceed. \nJonathan Arnold: My question was just answered. Thank you.\nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: All right.\nJonathan Arnold: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next -- and our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. One moment please. Okay. Mr. Weisel, your line is open. \nAndrew Weisel: Hi. Good morning everyone.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: To go back to this $0.03 to $0.04 monthly EPS impact from lower volumes, if I'm reading that correctly, that's only on the electric side. Do you have preliminary April data for gas demand? And what that might mean for a monthly run rate? It's a shoulder season, of course, but do you have any kind of ballpark rule of thumb for the gas side?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, first of all, as I mentioned, Andrew, the bulk of our gas is certainly during the heating season and that is behind us. That ends in March. And so, the $0.03 to $0.04 represents electric and gas for your sensitivity. \nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Good. Thank you. Then last question is for the two rate cases outstanding, have the conversations changed much given COVID-19? I know you're always laser focused on affordability. But are you hearing more concerns about things like the jump in unemployment and that were presumably in a recession? And as part of that, do you see any potential for the timing to be elongated, whether that's due to logistics or affordability concerns?\nPatti Poppe: Affordability is always factored into our filings to begin with. And so, for example, gas, our gas bills or customer's bills are down 30%, because of commodity benefits. And so, I personally think there's no time like now with the commodity prices where they are and how it's clear they're going to remain where they are, that we make the system safer. The system safety and the priority of the infrastructure investments on that system don't change because of this. And thankfully the commodity price is so low, so we can continue to keep our bills affordable both on the electric and the gas. And net-net, we're starting to really pay attention to the percent of household wallet that our bills play and they're in the 3% to 3.5% combined gas and electric. And we feel like that's extremely affordable. And so that's always been the focus in our cases and it will continue to be, but we feel good given the combination of the commodity price plus the value that the infrastructure investments has for customers.\nRejji Hayes: Andrew, you also asked about just process and timing. And the only thing I would add to that end is that the commission has -- like a lot of organizations and businesses and Michigan has transitioned quite nicely to mass teleworking and they have not missed a beat to date. And so, we've had very close communications with them. They have managed to keep up their adjudicated processes. And we also highlighted that they had a meeting on the 15th where they gave us that very constructive order on the COVID-19 related costs. So, they are on track, but it's also worth noting that per the statute, there was a 10-month stipulated period. And so in the event there are delays. We do have the legal right to self implement at that 10-month period, which for gas is around mid March and for electric it's in very late December.\nAndrew Weisel: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And just to clarify though on affordability, I think that was a great recap of your side of it. My question was more from interveners or regulators themselves or staff, has there been any kind of heightened concern about it, given what's going on in the economy?\nPatti Poppe: I think their concerns are consistent with concerns in the past that we will be concerned and they are too. And so we're pretty well aligned in that attention and focus. \nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. Thank you. \nRejji Hayes: Andrew, one more thing, just to circle back, apologies, but the gas -- the timing of that is mid October, I mentioned mid-March. Mid October, excuse me. \nOperator: Okay. And our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. \nTravis Miller: Thank you. Good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: Okay. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the renewable side. How much were you expecting in terms of project completion or contracts to sign this year? And what are your thoughts? What are you seeing in terms of being able to get to those numbers plus or minus your expectations for the year? \nPatti Poppe: Yeah, our big projects this year are a couple of wind projects that are scheduled to close by year-end. And both of those are on track. We have been issued force majeure letters, but that doesn't mean that work stops. It's just sort of a forewarning that there may be a shortage in access to equipment, whether it's turbines or some other equipment. So we have been notified, but to date the projects have not been delayed. And so we are on track. We've continued construction through this time period. And so, as of now everything is on track. \nTravis Miller: Okay. What about contracts signed or are the other projects, third party projects, they're saying, are they going along also? \nPatti Poppe: Yeah. Everything's on track for this calendar year. Yeah.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then real quick on the dividends, obviously the board decided the dividends well before we knew the seriousness of the COVID situation. Any chance, any metrics that they might be looking at here in the next couple quarters in terms of making a dividend change given the raise last quarter?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, I would suggest that there's no plan changed or dividend policy or strategy. Things would have to change very dramatically for there to be a change in that light. So, we have a board meeting next week. We'll be reviewing with them. Certainly our -- or later this week rather, we've got a board meeting, and so we'll obviously be talking with them about a range of scenarios, but none of those scenarios at this time contemplate any change to the dividend policy. \nTravis Miller: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning. Thanks for sneaking me here. And I appreciate the granularity in this slides is always. Just wanted to stay with a quick clarification. I think I am understanding this correctly, but in response to Steve's question, you mentioned 10% decline. Is that across all classes? So the sensitivity of $0.03 to $0.04 EPS hit per month has based on the commercial industrial 20%, 25%. That's what you're seeing is March, but the 10% is across all classes. Is that right?\nPatti Poppe: Correct.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, you mentioned you previously have been able to offset double-digit EPS headwinds through some of the cost mitigation efforts. Could you point to something in terms of what can you do? Are those things one-time in nature or could you take costs out of the business longer term? Any examples or any color would be helpful?\nPatti Poppe: Well, Durgesh, thank you for asking. I've been waiting to share my story of the month. I'm just going to assume that's what you're asking me for. So, here we go. Even in these times. So in fact, I think this one might be the story of this era. We've discovered that we can work remotely. So, let me just give you some numbers. So, in an annual period, we typically spend about $10 million a year reimbursing mileage. We have a large geographic service area and people have felt compelled to be in person for meetings and events. Frankly, I'm the one who makes them. I like to see people, I like to be with people. So I say, hey, come on out, be in person. But based on this circumstance in the COVID-19, we've been forced to learn to use technology and it's working actually. And it's sort of a triple bottom line story of the month, because first of all, people are safer certainly at this time because of COVID, but also minimizing mileage and driving, reduces the risk of a vehicle accident. The plan is better off with less vehicle emissions and our profits are better because the costs are lower. So, we can do video calls. They work. I used to avoid the face to face video calls. We just do the dial in and they're not the same. And we've learned and frankly I think there's a business to be had for the Judy Jetson masks. And if you're too young to know what I'm talking about, just YouTube Judy Jetson mask. There's an opportunity because sometimes we don't want to see our messy hair and without the salons being open, everyone's hair's looking pretty messy and the dog's barking. But the truth be told. We set this big ambition that we come together by staying apart and we're finding our culture is getting activated. People actually are coming closer. It's very interesting time. But on the fundamental cost, $10 million in mileage, you can bet we're going to be reimbursing less than that. There's other things that we do on the waste elimination. We've got a host, as I said 1,254 projects. Some of it is shortening our -- what's called non-premise time. When a crew goes to a service center, shows up to pick up materials and then reports to the jobsite, there can be an hour there that is considered non-premise time. That's expense. Their capital work doesn't commence until they start on the jobsite. So, the fact that we can get people to jobsites more quickly and we're re redesigning our supply chain so the materials can be available on site as opposed to people having to come to service centers is actually another great example of how this current circumstances is creating innovation, but permanent waste elimination that we can deploy in years to come.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Definitely did. Thank you so much. I appreciate it. \nOperator: Our next question today will come from Ryan Levine of Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. \nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Do any of your O&M or CapEx contracts have force majeure contract provisions that are impacted by this pandemic?\nPatti Poppe: Well, as I mentioned, we've had force majeure notices on some of our large renewable projects, but they're not affecting the timing or the outcome of those projects at this time.\nRyan Levine: So there was no impact on O&M contracts or any of the other contracts?\nPatti Poppe: We've not had any notifications of that on our other contracts.\nRyan Levine: Okay. And then can you provide more color on the potential items included in the cost reduction initiative flex that you highlighted, and what portion are more temporary nature versus long-term?\nPatti Poppe: Yeah, so a hiring freeze is obviously temporary, but things like -- we've started using technology and we were just starting this before the pandemic. That's why I'm so grateful that our CUA has been in place now for several years, because we've been deploying capabilities to our top waste opportunities. So, here's a great example. We've been what's called auto dispatching a storm proof. So, in the past we would wait for, in that -- call it a year ago -- we would have a customer call us, notify that their power was out. We would start to aggregate all that data in a dispatch center and then a person would determine, okay, we have this many outages on this circuit and they would schedule a crew. Well, now, we have automated all of that. We've used our digital capabilities, our IT team and our engineering and operations teams have been working together and agile teams actually all across the company. But this is one example of how they now auto dispatch storm crews. It saves 30 minutes on an outage per customer. And it eliminates the actual work of doing the dispatching, because it's done by a computer. It's more accurate and it's cheaper. So, it's just things like that all across the company. I think it's tempting for management teams to want to have big line items. We're a believer in the CUA and our continuous improvement mindset says little line items all across the company are going to be more sustainable and have grander benefits in the long run to both the experience for customers, as well as our fundamental cost structure.\nRyan Levine: Thanks. And then last question for me. What are you seeing in terms of working capital fluctuations in light of the 10 -- directionally 10% or decline post COVID-19, any meaningful fluctuations that impact your financing plan? \nPatti Poppe: Rejji, do you want to talk through the financing plan a little bit?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah, happy to. Yeah. So the quick answer is, working capital actually has been fairly smooth or I'll just say aligning with plan. As mentioned we have no CP outstanding and generally that would be, I'll say, a supplemental source of financing if we saw unpredictable working capital swings. But we obviously have been able to manage the working capital volatility to date, and there hasn't been much of that. And so we have not seen at this point any really material changes in working capital. But as Patti highlighted earlier, there's a bit of a lag when it comes to receivables aging. And so we'll continue to keep an eye on that. We obviously are very flush up from a cash perspective as evidenced by our proactive financings that we did at the end of the quarter. So, a little over $700 million in cash in that plus our evolving facility capacity gets us about $2.3 billion net liquidity position. So, we certainly feel like we have enough dry powder to manage any future volatility. But I haven't seen a whole lot to date to be honest. \nRyan Levine: Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks. \nPatti Poppe: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: And our next question today will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nDavid Fishman: Hi, good morning. \nPatti Poppe: Good morning, David.\nDavid Fishman: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanting to go back to the C&I demand numbers again. I think I remember that there was a large customer kind of pre-COVID that's sort of already was a bit of a drag on your kind of your year-on-year comparables. Am I remembering that correctly? And kind of how much of that 20% to 25% that customer represent those already known?\nPatti Poppe: That is correct. We have one large customer who had some contracts bought out at the end -- actually part way through last year. And so, they're reflected in last year sales and this year sales. And they're operating now, so they are actually essential, which is good. But they are at diminished load, so they are a portion of that 20% to 25%.\nDavid Fishman: Okay. But some of that then would already have been planned for when you were thinking about the 2020 guidance? \nRejji Hayes: That's true. We factor that into our plans for this year. \nDavid Fishman: Okay. And then, not to like to beat a dead horse here. But just on the flex range, when we think about the $0.10 to $0.15 that you guys have talked about historically speaking, now I know there's a lot of unknowns going forward with 2020. But when you kind of achieve those levels those were more or less to kind of meet your earnings targets specifically. Like you had a certain amount of negative in that year and then you flex to meet that. And that's kind of what you're illustrating for us here today?\nPatti Poppe: That's right. That's right. And it's, and it's been true on the other side as well, that when we've had favorability, we've pulled in costs and I'm prepared for the next year. And so the thing that I don't want loss on anyone, it's that we are always preparing, not just for this quarter or this year, but for years to come. And that's what has made us so reliable at delivering and doing exactly what we said we're going to do. And so that flex has upside and downside. That's why slide 6 shows that -- that range of up and down and obviously this is a down year and we are doing everything we can to leverage our skills and capability of adapting in that range.\nDavid Fishman: Okay. Thank you Patti. Those are my questions. So, everyone's family is safe and healthy.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, David. You too.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Very good morning.\nPatti Poppe: Good morning, Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Thanks. First of all, congratulations on the Supreme court victory. If that, - I assuming that that's it for the state, but is there any other appeal or anything going on at the federal level or where we finally finished with this - this proceeding? \nPatti Poppe: There's one other aspect of the local clearing requirement that is still being determined and it's a very procedural element, but fundamentally reauthorize -- reconfirming that the public service commission has the authority to establish a local clearing requirement, was a very important outcome. They have returned then the proceedings, the procedures back to the MPSC for implementation. So there's -- it still needs to be implemented, I guess I should say, but it -- the order was very important in the ruling by the Supreme court was very important. \nPaul Patterson: Yeah. Okay. Great. And then with respect to the bill payment trends that people have been asking about, I'm sorry if I missed this, but in terms of not -- let's say technically what's uncollectible or bad debt or anything like that, but just in general at -- do you have any - if you, if you gave it, I apologize for missing it. But so just -- what the cadence has been in terms of people paying, let's say for April? Like for instance we're hearing, I saw one statistic that one-third of people didn\u2019t, this is nationwide, they didn't pay their rent for April that they were sort of late paying their April rent the first few weeks. Do you have any numbers sort of like that for what you're sort of experiencing there on the ground? \nPatti Poppe: Not yet, but we do know, we do have call volume from business and residential customers asking for a -- what we would call grace and extension of payment plans. And so, we are doing that. As we talk to these businesses, they typically have three big concerns. One is, rent as you described. Two is payroll. Three, is utilities. And so, we've been able to be a source of support to them and we feel comfortable extending those payment plans but that doesn't necessarily then translate into an uncollectable, particularly for our business customers and so -- and we've got some really good community action agencies and support resources for residential customers that can help them make their payments on time in the short run as well. So, I would suggest that our forecast isn't good yet. There's more to come and more to learn and certainly by Q2, we'll have a much better eye on, being able to quantify that. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. And then just finally on enterprises, the $0.04 benefit, and I apologize again if I just missed this, but what drove that?\nPatti Poppe: Rejji, you want to talk through the enterprise quarter?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah, because -- so Paul, it was a combination of two things. So one, it was just the absence of an outage and Q1, so Filer City, did an outage last year. And so there was the absence of that and then just good cost performance at enterprises. And so that's really what drove the $0.04 positive variance. \nPaul Patterson: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Hang in there.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you. Gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remark.\nPatti Poppe: Thank you, Allison. And again, thank you everyone for joining us today on our call. Please continue to stay safe and be well and you know, we really look forward to seeing you face to face when we can. We miss you all. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you Patti, and good morning everyone. Let me first echo Patti's comments by wishing each of you and your loved ones safe passage through these trying times in which we live. As Patti highlighted, we're pleased to report our first quarter results for 2020. We delivered adjusted net income of $245 million or $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings excludes select nonrecurring items, primarily related to costs resulting from a voluntary coworker separation program which we commenced in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the favorable reversal of an accrued expense related to tax reform. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.11 above our Q1 2019 results, largely driven by rate relief, the net investment related expenses of utility and solid cost performance throughout our business. Switching gears to the COVID-19 related financial risks, as Patti noted, we are ever mindful of the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business and have begun to implement cost control measures to mitigate these risks. On slide nine, we've provided a summary of potential impacts, as well as several mitigating factors which should help reduce our exposure to some degree. First, I'll start with utility, which I'll remind you, represents over -- about 90% of our business. The effects of the pandemic in Michigan that Patti referenced have unsurprisingly reduced commercial industrial activity in the state, which has begun to materialize in our electric sales. Based on daily volumetric trends extracted from our smart meters over the past month or so, we've seen declines in weather normalized commercial industrial load of about 20% to 25%. The C&I load reduction has been partially offset by residential load, which is up over 5% over the same timeframe presumably due to mass teleworking and self quarantine measures.  As noted in the past, the residential customer segment offers our highest margins and represents over 60% of our customer contribution for electric and gas combined, which I'll discuss in more detail later. The other noteworthy financial risk, the utility, attributable with COVID-19 are potential increased costs and uncollectible accounts due to delays in customer payments and sequestration and quarantine related costs to ensure the safety of our coworkers. As mentioned, we are working hard to mitigate these risks and cost control measures and customer outreach programs. We also recently received an accounting order from the commission to apply to deferred accounting to uncollectible account expenses in excess of rates as Patti noted. And we will soon file a response to this initial order seeking approval to defer other costs related to COVID-19, including sequestration and quarantine related costs. As for non-utility businesses, which collectively represent about 10% of the earnings, the potential risks are largely on the revenue side and broadly speaking are fairly well mitigated. And enterprises a vast majority of its revenue streams are contracted at fixed prices with credit worthy counterparties. It is also worth noting that the Supreme Court of Michigan recently issued an order, upholding the MPSCs ability to enforce a local clearing requirement for all energy providers in the state. Longer term, this decision could create opportunities for DIG, given the favorable trends we've observed in the last two planning resource auctions in MISO for Zone 7 which just cleared the cost of new entry. With regards to EnerBank, the primary risk in the current environment are loan origination volume and a potential increase in charge offs. But it's important to remember that the business model EnerBank is unique. We are not underwriting mortgages or making auto or small business loans. EnerBank underwrites home improvement loans primarily to premium credit quality borrowers whose average FICO scores are above 750. This borrower base has proven to be relatively more resilient during economic downturns. And in fact, in 2008 EnerBank's originations increased given the relative inelasticity of its core borrower base and through market share gains at the expense of weaker capitalized competitors.  The final notable risk from an earnings perspective is in our parent and other segment, which is largely comprised of non-recoverable financing costs. I am pleased to report that due to proactive and cost effective liquidity management from our treasury team, we have no remaining maturities in 2020 and it fully priced our planned equity issuance needs for the year through forward contracts, which I'll elaborate on later. Circling back on the utility sales risk, which we've viewed the most substantial risk to our business in the current environment, slide 10 highlights the relative contribution mix of our customer segments and the load reductions we've witnessed since late March. As you'll note, the residential segment represents approximately 60% and 75% of the customer contribution for the electric and gas business respectively and over 60% of the total customer contribution at utilities I highlighted earlier. So, any uptick and growth in the residential segment should partially offset the expected declines we anticipate in the commercial and industrial segments. All-in, given the current sales trends we've observed since the public response to the pandemic, we estimate approximately $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS dilution per month. As Patty noted, at this point, it's too early to tell how long and to what extent social distancing measures will remain in place or how strong the economic recovery in Michigan will be upon its conclusion. As such, we have provided this monthly sensitivity for your modeling purposes and we'll keep your breasts at any material changes to our plan. On slide 11 in our waterfall chart you can see the key factors impacting our financial performance relative to 2019. Despite an unusually warm winter which offered $0.23 of negative variance versus Q1 of 2019, the absence of the substantial service restoration costs due to storms we experienced last year, coupled with last September supportive gas rate order and cost performance throughout the business, delivered $0.11 of net positive variance versus the first quarter of 2019. Depending on the extent to which the financial risks of COVID-19 manifest, we believe the glide path illustrated on this slide could enable us to achieve our EPS guidance as we plan for normal weather and anticipate a constructive order and our pending gas case in mid-October. As mentioned, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on Michigan's economy and our business remains uncertain, so we have referenced the estimate monthly EPS dilution of $0.03 to $0.04 in the event the level of sales degradation that we have witnessed to date persists. Further, we will closely monitor the potential risk to our business, some of which have been mitigated through regulatory support. We have also added the historical range of annual financial risks that we have successfully mitigated over the past several years, which equates to approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per share or $40 million to $70 million pre-tax. Clearly, we have a strong track record of managing the work and delivering cost reductions through our lean operating system the CE way and other initiatives. And as Patti noted, we've already implemented an initial wave of cost control measures. Needless to say, we are not here to represent that any downside scenario can be overcome, particularly given the unprecedented nature of this global pandemic. However, we are confident that we can minimize the financial risk in 2020 without jeopardizing our long-term value proposition to our customers and investors. As we execute our risk mitigation strategies, you'll note on slide 12 that we have prioritized liquidity management and have over $2.3 billion of net liquidity available, which includes unrestricted cash and untaught -- untapped revolving credit facility capacity as of March 31.  We've always managed our balance sheet in conservative manner and so whether there've been a lot of concerns regarding access to the commercial paper market, I'll remind everyone that we do not rely on CP as a permanent layer of funding, nor do we have any outstanding at this time. As part of our funding strategy for the year, we put in place term loans to the parent and the utility for $300 million each and those don't mature until 2021. And in mid-March we issued $575 million of first mortgage bonds at a rate of 3.5%, which addressed our sole maturity across our debt issuing entities in 2020 and funds our capital programs.  From an equity financing perspective, we announced on our Q4 call, our plans to issue up to $250 million of equity, all of which is priced under existing equity forward contracts and we drew down approximately a $100 million of that capacity in late March. We expect future equity issuances can be completed through our ATM program, which we will likely refile in the coming months. All of our financings have been executed at terms favorable to our plan, which offer entry year savings and help derisk the future. As we look forward, we'll continue to maintain flexibility and capitalize on accommodated market conditions when they emerge. Highlight with our credit metrics on slide 13 which remained well above the thresholds for investment grade ratings among all three credit rating agencies. Our focused on maintaining a strong financial position coupled with a supportive regulatory environment and predictable operating cash flow growth supports our strong ratings, and we'll look to maintain our strong credit quality with an eye toward the future to the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll pass it back to Patti for some closing comments before we open up the lines for Q&A. Morning. Same to you Steve. Yeah, so, we don't have -- if you're talking about post Q1 beyond March 31, we do not have a full read across all of our customers, because smart meter data... ... [indiscernible] good portion of our customers are select classes of large industrial and commercial customers that do not have smart meter data available. We do get good anecdotal evidence from those customers and do get good visibility, but we don't get perfect information really until we get to the end of the quarter. So, there are some limitations in that. But I would say, Steve, going back to Patti's comments, the 20% to 25% we highlight here again that is not indicative of all of our customers, but it's a decent read for now for that monthly read that we've offered from late March through kind of mid to late April. So that's a -- again, it's not a every single customer, but it's a decent portion of them. That's exactly right. The only thing I would add is that it's certainly the timing of this is -- somewhat fortunate because we do expect higher volumes as it starts to go a little warmer particularly in the residential class now. So, we'll see more industrial activity sort of as you get past those shoulder months. And so, the timing of this, I guess if you could it happen at any time, which you don't root for, this would be the time to have it. And so certainly there are greater expectations for load once you get beyond sort of the March/April timeframe. Thank you. Thanks Patti. And good morning, Stephen. So Stephen, I would say that -- and that's certainly we did see a little bit of a slowdown in March on origination volume, but we've actually been encouraged with what we're seeing in April. And it's important to note a couple of things. So, every state has a different approach to the executive orders that have rolled out, but financial service is deemed an essential service and that's a federal mandate. And so, we've managed to continue our underwriting and also, construction projects that are work in progress or quipped. For all intents and purposes, those bits of work have also been permitted to continue on. And so, we really haven't seen the type of slowdown you would anticipate for some of the loans that EnerBank has historically underwritten.  So, I would say encouraged by what we're seeing in April unsurprisingly, a little bit of a slowdown in March. And we still think, they started the quarter off or the year off pretty well, about a penny above the prior year. And we're only asking for about a penny to two of growth year-over-year for them and they appear to be on track. And so, the other opportunities as you think about origination volume is also on the gain share side. And so what we've seen in the past, particularly in 2008/2009 is you had a lot of weaker capitalized competitors who kind of fell by the wayside. And we've already seen anecdotally some large customers come our way, because they know that EnerBank is in it for the long haul. This is their primary focus. And so, we've actually taken some share, which we also did in 2008/2009. And so, just existing originations and continuing to execute on our plan as well as taking share also create opportunities this year. And so, we feel good about the road ahead where we sit at this point. Sure. Great. So, yeah, we look at that range and it's based on what we've done historically over the last several years. And so, we've seen that level of negative variance in a quarter. We've seen over the course of the year, but we've managed to and in historical context, overcome levels of flex of that magnitude or levels of negative variance of that magnitude. As I look at this year we certainly think that $0.10 to $0.15 year to go is certainly within us. And let's just think about what that math equates to. So, on the low end about $40 million pretax, on the high end call it $60 million to $65 million. And when you think about our year to go spend, we've got about a $1 billion of, I'll say, actionable opportunities between operating and non-operating cost pools. So that reduction equates to a little more than 5%, which is certainly within us. And so not to suggest it's easy and to Patti's earlier point, we're not going to do anything that's rash or detrimental to the years to come. And so, we do feel like it's within us, but at the end of the day we'll have to see how this situation in Michigan materializes, and we'll make prudent decisions as we always do. Andrew, you also asked about just process and timing. And the only thing I would add to that end is that the commission has -- like a lot of organizations and businesses and Michigan has transitioned quite nicely to mass teleworking and they have not missed a beat to date. And so, we've had very close communications with them. They have managed to keep up their adjudicated processes. And we also highlighted that they had a meeting on the 15th where they gave us that very constructive order on the COVID-19 related costs. So, they are on track, but it's also worth noting that per the statute, there was a 10-month stipulated period. And so in the event there are delays. We do have the legal right to self implement at that 10-month period, which for gas is around mid March and for electric it's in very late December. Andrew, one more thing, just to circle back, apologies, but the gas -- the timing of that is mid October, I mentioned mid-March. Mid October, excuse me. Yeah, happy to. Yeah. So the quick answer is, working capital actually has been fairly smooth or I'll just say aligning with plan. As mentioned we have no CP outstanding and generally that would be, I'll say, a supplemental source of financing if we saw unpredictable working capital swings. But we obviously have been able to manage the working capital volatility to date, and there hasn't been much of that. And so we have not seen at this point any really material changes in working capital. But as Patti highlighted earlier, there's a bit of a lag when it comes to receivables aging. And so we'll continue to keep an eye on that. We obviously are very flush up from a cash perspective as evidenced by our proactive financings that we did at the end of the quarter. So, a little over $700 million in cash in that plus our evolving facility capacity gets us about $2.3 billion net liquidity position. So, we certainly feel like we have enough dry powder to manage any future volatility. But I haven't seen a whole lot to date to be honest. Thanks. That's true. We factor that into our plans for this year. Yeah, because -- so Paul, it was a combination of two things. So one, it was just the absence of an outage and Q1, so Filer City, did an outage last year. And so there was the absence of that and then just good cost performance at enterprises. And so that's really what drove the $0.04 positive variance. Thank you. Gentlemen, this will conclude our question and answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Patti Poppe for any closing remark."

            "name": "Patti Poppe",
            "content": "Thank you Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We hope that you're staying safe and healthy during these extraordinary times. This morning, I'll discuss our first quarter results and long-term outlook, as well as provide an update on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Rejji will add more details on our financial results later and discuss sensitivities related to COVID-19. And as always, we'll close with QA. I'd like to start by acknowledging that this health crisis is affecting scores of people in really unimaginable ways. My heart is with each of you, and I know that there will be a post COVID. May your family and friends be stronger, closer and at peace when all of this is behind us. You know what always keeps my team and I anchored is our focus on the long-term, and our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. We have a track record of delivering industry-leading financial performance and we have solid fundamentals in our favor that have served us well in years past and will enable us to navigate today and in the future. Now, let's get to the numbers. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.86 in the first quarter, despite challenging weather conditions and the onset of this unprecedented global pandemic. Our first quarter results were $0.11 better than 2019 results for the same period, mostly driven by cost management, regulatory outcomes and our ability to adapt to changing conditions, whether it be the temperatures outside or adjusting to life under a stay at home order. As a stay home, stay safe order is still in place for Michigan and the situation is continuing to evolve, it's too soon to provide an update on our guidance we issued on January 30. So, given the fluidity of the situation, at this time, we're not changing our guidance for the year of $2.64 to $2.68.  Though the current circumstance is certainly challenging, our investment thesis remains intact and our business model resilient, both of which will support our long-term operational and financial objectives, as we continue to target long-term annual earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Let's take a moment to get everyone up to speed on what we're seeing here in Michigan and what we're doing to lessen COVID related impacts on the communities that we serve. On March 23, Governor Whitmer issued a stay at home order requiring all non-essential businesses to close until April 13, which has now been extended until mid-May with some loosening of retail and recreational restrictions previously in place. Schools are closed for the remainder of the academic year. Prior to the Governor's order, we established our Incident Command Structure or ICS. So, we were already functioning in our emergency response mode as conditions worsened, particularly in the southeast portion of the state. Early on, we retained a Chief Medical Officer to help guide our operational decision-making and ensure we could perform our necessary work safely. We instituted a travel ban for business activities and the necessary self quarantining for employees after any personal travel. We quickly transitioned to a remote workforce, and I'm pleased that the team responded with great agility. For team members and critical on-site operational roles including those working in control rooms, and that generating plants and natural gas compression stations, we've implemented numerous safety protocols following all CDC guidelines, including and in some cases sequestration. For the remaining workforce, our coworkers are either working from home or reporting directly to the jobsite from their homes to continue operations in the field and ensure their safety. At this time, we've experienced zero fatalities, and 11 of our over 8,000 coworkers, our work family have tested positive for COVID-19. Yet, we're thankful that seven of those coworkers have been able to return to work, and they each identified case has yielded fewer and fewer ancillary cases of contact, which means our social distancing is working. Our COVID-19 case rate is three times less than the broader Michigan rate. We believe that our safe work practices have been essential in protecting our coworkers from exposure to this virus. We're taking by-weekly poll surveys of our coworkers to see how they're doing during this time. And I'm very proud to report that over 90% of our team is satisfied with how we're handling the COVID-19 pandemic as a company. Our safety culture and commitment to our people has been a source of strength for all of us, and we'll remain deliberate in our efforts to keep our coworkers and our customers safe. Beyond safety, we know our customers are facing economic challenges and we've stepped up to support them. Some of the most deeply impacted at this time are our small business customers, who are the heart of Michigan's economic engine. When we get on the other side of this current crisis, and there will be another side, our small businesses will serve as an essential role in fueling the economy once again. We know and love these customers and understand the hardships they're going through, and they have tailored our services accordingly. We've redeployed our business customer care team to help our customers navigate the state and federal assistance programs. We trained our team on the federal and state funding available and created scripts and content specifically tailored to our small business customers. And on a personal level some of you may have seen, my husband Eric and I set up the Dream Maker Fund at the onset of the crisis with a personal contribution, which has provided emergency relief to our small businesses in Jackson, Michigan, where we live and where the company is headquartered. This has given us a front row seat on the small business impact of COVID-19 here in Michigan. The company and Consumers Energy Foundation have also taken a number of actions to help our vulnerable residential customers, including extending our payment protection plans through June 1, dispersing over a $1 million in grants and donations to facilitate the needs of our healthcare workers, supporting our local food banks and charities, as well as matching our coworkers donations to local charities. Needless to say, we haven't lost track of you our investors. We're mindful of the COVID related risks on our business. And we're always on the job identifying those risks and managing the work every year in every aspect of the business. We operate both in natural gas and electric business, and natural gas represents one-third of our revenues at the utility and is the fastest growing segment. The bulk of our gas business margin comes from our residential customers and is earned in the heating season which ended in March, and we expect residential gas sales to be normal in the fourth quarter. While our electric deliveries are certainly down year-over-year, we will remind you that we have a track record of mitigating financial risks given the inherent volatility in our business which I will cover on the next slide. We're grateful for the leadership and partnership our Public Service Commission has demonstrated. We're working together to make sure our coworkers are safe and our customers are cared for. The Commission is collecting and reviewing costs related to COVID-19, including uncollectible accounts and sequestration and quarantine related costs. The Commission established deferred accounting for uncollectible expense above what's currently approved in rates, which Rejji will elaborate on later and speaks to the constructive regulatory environment here in Michigan. As we turn to slide six, we'll remind you that we've seen significant unforeseen challenges and double-digit EPS downside in previous years. In fact, in 2016 and 2017, we had as much as $0.13 and $0.16 of negative variance. And through conservative planning and a bottoms-up approach to cost management, we were able to deliver on our operational and financial objectives. With that said, as a result of anticipated COVID related financial risks this year, like most, we've implemented several cost control measures, such as a hiring freeze, reduced over time, and minimize travel and training expenses. Plus more sustainably, we'll rely on our ability to accelerate cost savings and waste elimination through our Consumers Energy Way to pursue our financial objectives without compromising customer service. Rejji will provide some of the sensitivities for the risks we've highlighted and potential offsets.  As we gain more visibility in Q2 and beyond, we'll adjust our plan accordingly to remain agile and make choices that mitigate the impact in 2020 and protect our long-term operational and financial performance. While we don't know the ultimate impact of COVID-19, we do know how to manage and operate a world-class business that delivers over the long-term. And that brings us full circle as we talk to you today. Our long-term investment thesis remains unchanged, despite the near term uncertainty presented by COVID-19. Over the years, we've been good stewards of the balance sheet, maintaining a healthy level of liquidity and we plan conservatively. We still have a large and ageing system and need a significant investment. We still have a constructive regulatory environment and we still have the CE way that enables us to serve our customers, while keeping their energy costs affordable. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thanks, Rejji. My coworkers and I remained on the job every day for our customers and for you, our owners. We're focused on delivering an essential service to nearly 6.7 million of our fellow Michiganders. The capital you all provide is critical and our long-term track record of managing that capital speaks to that commitment. As I mentioned, we've been good stewards of our balance sheet, with prudent planning and our conservative liquidity management continues. Already for 2020 we executed financings at attractive rates that enable us to fund our capital programs. Our operational excellence shines through during times like these. As we continue to rely on the CE way and lean in on that lean operating system we have in place, we improve each and every day. We put to work efficiencies that drive down costs and eliminate waste. And I can tell you that system is in overdrive right now, which speaks to our agility as we shift accordingly depending on how this current environment evolves.  Since the 2008 energy law was established and updated again in 2016, Michigan has remained a top tier regulatory jurisdiction. With forward-looking test years and 10 months rate cases, we're fortunate to have such a constructive regulatory framework in statute. We also have a supportive commission. As you can see by the recent order responding to the pandemic for the protection of vulnerable customers while being mindful of utility, being able to fund its operations and attract low cost long-term capital. Our system remains in great need of replacements and upgrades and that won't go away as a result of the current pandemic. Again, we're fortunate that our plans have embedded structural cost reductions in the form of retiring coal plants and PPAs expiring. Finally, none of this comes at a price to our planet and the great state of Michigan we all love so dearly. Our net zero carbon and methane goals remain as important today as the day we establish them. Our model holds together well. That's why this thesis remains intact and that's why we can rely on our triple bottom line to get us through this current crisis just it has in the past and will do so in the future.  With that, Alison, will you please open the lines for Q&A? Good morning, Shar. Shar, thanks for asking. We've tried to be really transparent here. We have a track record of offsetting negative impacts, the EPS, as you mentioned, ranging in as much $0.10 to 0.15. We also have a track record of transparency, which is why we've tried to be as direct and forthcoming as we can about the C&I sales that have dropped 20% to 25% versus expectations. And with then the offsetting residential sales up over 5%, the earnings impact, as you've mentioned and what we've said, is $0.03 to $0.04 per month under the current condition. Now, here's the variables. How fast will businesses bounce back? How soon will people gather in public spaces? How quickly will manufacturers be able to start making non-essential goods again? Our stay at home order is still in place till May 15. Will the government stimulus help so that the small businesses can come back after this? At this point, there's just too many unknowns, Shar. And so, while we'll continue to remain conservative, we don't feel that we know enough right now. And so I guess I would offer this thing. One thing you can count on us to do is to call it straight. We've never over promised and under delivered, and nor have we really under promised and over delivered. We do what we say. I'm comfortable in the fact that our long-term fundamentals are the same and our short term actions will stand the test of time. One of the things, Shar, I think about a lot is that our customers, our coworkers and our regulators will long remember how we handle these temporary times. I feel good about that because we're doing the right things and we like always are acting with the long-term in mind and the long-term outlook has not changed and our fundamentals remain sound. So, as we think about any adjustments we would make this year or any actions we would take this year, we're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so, we're balancing all of those factors and doing everything we can to serve the triple bottom line. What I would say is our historical performance is a good indicator, but we've also -- now we're about four years into the CE Way and that thing is on overdrive. And our team is on the job. They're looking for waste elimination all across the organization. We have 1,254 projects already identified this year. Start the day, time reduction. Some of the things that we're doing now as a result of the crisis, such as jobsite reporting, are actually saving money. And so, it's both the combination of current factors. There's current environmental things that allow us to save money plus our CE Way and the waste elimination and our ability to deploy our team to as much long-term capital work are the kinds of ways that we see tackling this challenge in a sustainable way. We're always thinking about the next year and the next. And so the cost savings that we would do would only be those that don't do damage to the future. The one thing, we think about we're not going to pull out all the stops and do damage to future years to hit some kind of unreasonable outcome this year. We're going to be in it for the long haul. And I think that's why people trust us and invest in us. We have a limited exposure to auto, less than 2% tier one suppliers plus the automotive themselves to our margin. What we're seeing is more the stay home order closed all restaurants, it closed all retail other than non-essential retail like grocery. And so that's where we're really seeing a lot -- and small manufacturers that aren't making essential goods. As I mentioned, my husband and I did this fund and so we've had an opportunity to look at all of the applications just in Jackson County and it's a whole range of things, golf courses, restaurants, bakeries, retail, little manufacturing shops, welding shops. They're in a holding pattern right now, waiting for the order to be lifted. And some of those businesses, even after the order is lifted, will be affected by people's reticence to gather in groups. Others will get right back at it. And so, we see a balance between some of them just purely waiting for May 15, and they'll be back on it full time. And there'll be others that may have a demand reduction because of people's fear. And so, again, there's a lot of unknowns. And fortunately, our smart meter data is very accurate and we can see real-time what's happening and it helps us make better decisions and better choices. Thanks, Shar. Thanks, Steve. Good morning. Rejji, what's our total sales adjustment then? Yeah, Steve, I would say 10% total is a decent bogey that -- for our customer base as well. You're in the neighborhood for sure. Well, we always deal with seasonality and the weather and that's what we certainly -- weather and storms, we've done a good job overcoming. In this scenario, there are so many, I would suggest the bigger drivers than just the weather that seasonality is obviously clearly a variable, but not nearly as much as some of the unknowns associated with the rate the businesses return to action. I don't know, Rejji, you might want to add something to that though. Go ahead. Well, I'll just chime in. One last thing, Steve, that one of the points that we recognize is that even after an order is lifted, it's likely -- and I'm hearing from a lot of businesses that they'll keep their staff, their people working from home if they can. And so that residential bump may continue into the summer months and obviously air conditioning load is a big driver in Michigan to sales in the summertime. And so, if all of those folks are still or if a lot of people are still working from home that obviously has a favorable impact in the summer months. Generally the same rate all year. So, next year we'll be implementing a more of a summer peak rate, but it's generally about the same throughout the year. We are watching that. The -- one of the things with the uncollectible accounts is they do lag. And so we can see to some degree, it's very early. If you can imagine, it's at a minim a 30-day lag so before we know if somebody didn't pay their bill. And so sometimes the uncollectible accounts really take almost three to six months to show up and to really be accounted for. And so, we're watching -- we're seeing a slight uptick, but it's early. It's -- we haven't even crossed all of the cycles for some of the customers. Thanks, Steve. Stay well. Good morning. Yeah. The cases are filed. Our gas case we filed in December and our electric case we filed here in February. So, there's not a clean way to have a significant substantive change to sales and frankly it would be hard to do it because we have forward test years. So what sales figure would we predict? So, we expect that our rate cases will continue as planned and because we do annual filings in the future, if there's a permanent degradation to sales, then we would reflect it. But it's pretty hard to capture a temporary degradation in sales like the one we're seeing in any kind of active filing. The good news is that our commission has been very supportive, just a shout out to the Michigan Public Service Commission and all their folks for adapting so quickly to this changing condition. They've already started holding their meetings and conducting business remotely through webcast. They too have had a significant impact. So thanks to all of them for acting so quickly and working with us on this new order for the CV-19 costs as well as the uncollectible accounts and trying to make sure that we, as a utility, are in a position to serve our customers well, do what's right, care for our most vulnerable customers and know that we can still function in a strong financial position that that reflects the capital attraction that we need to demonstrate. And so, great partnership with the commission and all their team, working so hard to just figure out these unknowables together. Yeah. Right now, we're not seeing that in the plan. And in fact, we're working hard to make sure that -- for example, our power plants because energy load and demand is down, are an economic reserve, a couple of our coal plants. And so that gives us an opportunity to pull ahead of capital outage at that plant earlier in the year than we had originally planned. So, I don't -- we don't have any plans in the near term to have any adjustment to our capital plan. In fact, we're going to really work hard to make sure we keep that plan on track. Yeah, the -- it -- because DIG is basically fully contracted, it doesn't have any certain impact on 2020, minimal in 2021, but there could be some out year impact that could be beneficial. But again, just keep in mind the DIG is predominantly contracted as Rejji had mentioned with high quality off taker. We are pleased with the outcome of that order though, and shout out to our legal team took it all the way to, the Supreme Court of Michigan did a great job advocating for the Public Service Commission and their authority to require a local clearing requirement. The law that we worked so hard to pass back in 2016, that was a fundamental element of it to make sure that Michigan as a Peninsula Zone 7 has adequate supply to serve the load. And with our kind of hybrid retail open access 10%, it does put at risk reliability in the state. So very happy with that outcome and very thankful and proud of my legal team for the great work that they did. Yeah. So, we've benefited -- and remember it's just a cash benefit, but about $30 million of AMT credits, we'll pull forward in 2020, that would have originally been refunded in 2021. Again, that just affects cash, not earnings in any way. Thank you, Michael. Thank you so much. Morning, Julien. You too. So, Julien and I know everyone wants precision in these uncertain times. And there's a reason why the word unprecedented is like the number one word in youth these days. We just haven't been here before. So, as we said, it's just too soon for us to update our guidance. And it would mean that we know exactly how to help -- how the health crisis ends, how the economy will look afterwards, and frankly we don't know. And so, there are reasons to believe in a bounce back. The federal stimulus is working or watching. It helps small businesses, but can the businesses get access to it? Construction, manufacturing, ag can bounce back quickly and work safely, but will there be demand? I talked to an office furniture CEO, most of the office furniture in the world is made right here in Michigan and I talked to one of the CEOs last week and they may be at all time highs because they save workplaces need to be reorganized and new furniture is going to be required or maybe none of us are reporting to an office ever again. There's just a lot of changes. Will there be a drive in residential electricity demand? We've talked about that already. Maybe there will be. The shelter in place order can be lifted, but how long will people feel -- will it be before people feel safe to congregate in a public gathering. I don't know. We don't know. But here's what we do know, Julien. We know that we need our coworkers healthy and motivated to do our capital plan and it's a good infrastructure plan that serves the people of Michigan. We need our regulators to trust that we're doing what's right and taking care of both our coworkers and our customers. We need our customers to be with us and to survive this pandemic and be open for business when it's over, which is why we're working so hard to serve them with new information and help them navigate the circumstances.  What we can do is continue to run this business and look to mitigate costs and risks as they come up and never lose focus. And as I mentioned earlier on the long-term fundamental they're solid, right? The fundamentals of the business are the same. How we handle it in this temporary condition, as I mentioned, will be long remembered and so the cost savings, additional cost savings, what we would do to mitigate it are all going to be with an eye on the future. We're not going to take short term risks on a tomorrow's performance. And so, we're going to do our darnedest, us, how we think and how we operate. Again, our CE way is a great source of comfort to me, because we've actually developed some real capability across the organization and just in overdrive as I mentioned. So, given all that, I would say, it's too soon to say, but trust me, we're not waiting on the sidelines to figure it out. Well, we're going to have to see. We'll be filing our response. They've asked for comments, which is a very important and constructive. We need to hear from a lot of people as we make these determinations. Once the accounting is clarified and we've got certainty about that, then we can account for it. And then we'll have benefits obviously in 2020. They've been pretty clear about the uncollectible expenses as a result of a mandate to not shut off our most vulnerable customers, our seniors and low-income through June 1. And so, they've been pretty clear about those uncollectible expenses and the accounting treatment thereof, but it's really some of the other expenses and exactly the timing of that uncollectible when it materializes et cetera. So, others will be weighing in, and certainly I can't speak for the MPSC, but I can just say that we're working together to make sure that we're able to serve the most vulnerable constructively. Thanks Julien. Good morning, Stephen. Thanks. Well, I've been doing all the talking, so I'm going to hand it over to Rejji. He is the Chairman of the EnerBank Board. I'll let him speak about the great work that the EnerBank team is up to. Go ahead, Rejji. Rejji, you can go ahead. Thanks, Stephen. Hi, Jonathan. Thanks, Jonathan. Good morning, Andrew. Yeah, first of all, as I mentioned, Andrew, the bulk of our gas is certainly during the heating season and that is behind us. That ends in March. And so, the $0.03 to $0.04 represents electric and gas for your sensitivity. Affordability is always factored into our filings to begin with. And so, for example, gas, our gas bills or customer's bills are down 30%, because of commodity benefits. And so, I personally think there's no time like now with the commodity prices where they are and how it's clear they're going to remain where they are, that we make the system safer. The system safety and the priority of the infrastructure investments on that system don't change because of this. And thankfully the commodity price is so low, so we can continue to keep our bills affordable both on the electric and the gas. And net-net, we're starting to really pay attention to the percent of household wallet that our bills play and they're in the 3% to 3.5% combined gas and electric. And we feel like that's extremely affordable. And so that's always been the focus in our cases and it will continue to be, but we feel good given the combination of the commodity price plus the value that the infrastructure investments has for customers. I think their concerns are consistent with concerns in the past that we will be concerned and they are too. And so we're pretty well aligned in that attention and focus. Good morning, Travis. Yeah, our big projects this year are a couple of wind projects that are scheduled to close by year-end. And both of those are on track. We have been issued force majeure letters, but that doesn't mean that work stops. It's just sort of a forewarning that there may be a shortage in access to equipment, whether it's turbines or some other equipment. So we have been notified, but to date the projects have not been delayed. And so we are on track. We've continued construction through this time period. And so, as of now everything is on track. Yeah. Everything's on track for this calendar year. Yeah. Yeah, I would suggest that there's no plan changed or dividend policy or strategy. Things would have to change very dramatically for there to be a change in that light. So, we have a board meeting next week. We'll be reviewing with them. Certainly our -- or later this week rather, we've got a board meeting, and so we'll obviously be talking with them about a range of scenarios, but none of those scenarios at this time contemplate any change to the dividend policy. Correct. Well, Durgesh, thank you for asking. I've been waiting to share my story of the month. I'm just going to assume that's what you're asking me for. So, here we go. Even in these times. So in fact, I think this one might be the story of this era. We've discovered that we can work remotely. So, let me just give you some numbers. So, in an annual period, we typically spend about $10 million a year reimbursing mileage. We have a large geographic service area and people have felt compelled to be in person for meetings and events. Frankly, I'm the one who makes them. I like to see people, I like to be with people. So I say, hey, come on out, be in person. But based on this circumstance in the COVID-19, we've been forced to learn to use technology and it's working actually. And it's sort of a triple bottom line story of the month, because first of all, people are safer certainly at this time because of COVID, but also minimizing mileage and driving, reduces the risk of a vehicle accident. The plan is better off with less vehicle emissions and our profits are better because the costs are lower. So, we can do video calls. They work. I used to avoid the face to face video calls. We just do the dial in and they're not the same. And we've learned and frankly I think there's a business to be had for the Judy Jetson masks. And if you're too young to know what I'm talking about, just YouTube Judy Jetson mask. There's an opportunity because sometimes we don't want to see our messy hair and without the salons being open, everyone's hair's looking pretty messy and the dog's barking. But the truth be told. We set this big ambition that we come together by staying apart and we're finding our culture is getting activated. People actually are coming closer. It's very interesting time. But on the fundamental cost, $10 million in mileage, you can bet we're going to be reimbursing less than that. There's other things that we do on the waste elimination. We've got a host, as I said 1,254 projects. Some of it is shortening our -- what's called non-premise time. When a crew goes to a service center, shows up to pick up materials and then reports to the jobsite, there can be an hour there that is considered non-premise time. That's expense. Their capital work doesn't commence until they start on the jobsite. So, the fact that we can get people to jobsites more quickly and we're re redesigning our supply chain so the materials can be available on site as opposed to people having to come to service centers is actually another great example of how this current circumstances is creating innovation, but permanent waste elimination that we can deploy in years to come. Good morning, Ryan. Well, as I mentioned, we've had force majeure notices on some of our large renewable projects, but they're not affecting the timing or the outcome of those projects at this time. We've not had any notifications of that on our other contracts. Yeah, so a hiring freeze is obviously temporary, but things like -- we've started using technology and we were just starting this before the pandemic. That's why I'm so grateful that our CUA has been in place now for several years, because we've been deploying capabilities to our top waste opportunities. So, here's a great example. We've been what's called auto dispatching a storm proof. So, in the past we would wait for, in that -- call it a year ago -- we would have a customer call us, notify that their power was out. We would start to aggregate all that data in a dispatch center and then a person would determine, okay, we have this many outages on this circuit and they would schedule a crew. Well, now, we have automated all of that. We've used our digital capabilities, our IT team and our engineering and operations teams have been working together and agile teams actually all across the company. But this is one example of how they now auto dispatch storm crews. It saves 30 minutes on an outage per customer. And it eliminates the actual work of doing the dispatching, because it's done by a computer. It's more accurate and it's cheaper. So, it's just things like that all across the company. I think it's tempting for management teams to want to have big line items. We're a believer in the CUA and our continuous improvement mindset says little line items all across the company are going to be more sustainable and have grander benefits in the long run to both the experience for customers, as well as our fundamental cost structure. Rejji, do you want to talk through the financing plan a little bit? Thanks, Ryan. Good morning, David. That is correct. We have one large customer who had some contracts bought out at the end -- actually part way through last year. And so, they're reflected in last year sales and this year sales. And they're operating now, so they are actually essential, which is good. But they are at diminished load, so they are a portion of that 20% to 25%. That's right. That's right. And it's, and it's been true on the other side as well, that when we've had favorability, we've pulled in costs and I'm prepared for the next year. And so the thing that I don't want loss on anyone, it's that we are always preparing, not just for this quarter or this year, but for years to come. And that's what has made us so reliable at delivering and doing exactly what we said we're going to do. And so that flex has upside and downside. That's why slide 6 shows that -- that range of up and down and obviously this is a down year and we are doing everything we can to leverage our skills and capability of adapting in that range. Thank you, David. You too. Good morning, Paul. There's one other aspect of the local clearing requirement that is still being determined and it's a very procedural element, but fundamentally reauthorize -- reconfirming that the public service commission has the authority to establish a local clearing requirement, was a very important outcome. They have returned then the proceedings, the procedures back to the MPSC for implementation. So there's -- it still needs to be implemented, I guess I should say, but it -- the order was very important in the ruling by the Supreme court was very important. Not yet, but we do know, we do have call volume from business and residential customers asking for a -- what we would call grace and extension of payment plans. And so, we are doing that. As we talk to these businesses, they typically have three big concerns. One is, rent as you described. Two is payroll. Three, is utilities. And so, we've been able to be a source of support to them and we feel comfortable extending those payment plans but that doesn't necessarily then translate into an uncollectable, particularly for our business customers and so -- and we've got some really good community action agencies and support resources for residential customers that can help them make their payments on time in the short run as well. So, I would suggest that our forecast isn't good yet. There's more to come and more to learn and certainly by Q2, we'll have a much better eye on, being able to quantify that. Rejji, you want to talk through the enterprise quarter? Thank you, Allison. And again, thank you everyone for joining us today on our call. Please continue to stay safe and be well and you know, we really look forward to seeing you face to face when we can. We miss you all. Thanks so much."

The earnings release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call beginning today at 12:00 P.M. Eastern Time and will be viewed February 2022. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, President and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the team continued to deliver strong performance in 2021, demonstrating consistent results across the triple bottom line for our coworkers, customers, communities, and you, our investors. Allow me to take a few minutes to share the big wins this team accomplished in 2021. It is a point of pride that CMS was named the number one utility in the U.S. by Forbes for women and for workplace diversity. It starts with our coworkers and we know that companies that value and practice diversity, equity and inclusion deliver stronger performance. Our commitment to people, our coworkers and customers was in high year all year. For our coworkers, we delivered the 11th straight year of first quartile employee engagement. For our customers, we delivered first quartile customer experience, unlocks several programs, which support our most vulnerable and prepare all for a cleaner future with EVs and renewable energy generation. This year's highlights include the expansion of our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which allows for an incremental 1,000 megawatts of owned renewables and our PowerMIFleet EV program to meet the demand of Michigan businesses governments and schools as they electrify their fleet. And just this week, we announced along with General Motors, the plan to power three existing auto plants with 100% clean energy through our Voluntary Green Pricing program. And I know \u2013 Yes. Yes, I know all of you want to hear about our IRP. Our clean energy plan, also known as our IRP, places us in a solid leadership position on the transformation to clean energy. It has us out of coal by 2025, which achieves 60% carbon emissions reduction. I am pleased with the progress we are seeing in the regulatory process. I look forward to landing the IRP in 2022. I also want to share the progress we have made with our gas system. Our commitment to be Net Zero methane by 2030 is industry leading. We are making our gas system safer and cleaner by replacing older mains and services with modern materials. This year, we reduced use methane emissions by more than 445 metric tons and executed on our best year ever for main replacement. This stand to reduce methane extends beyond our system with exciting new programs, which will make a positive impact on the planet. We recently announced a plan to build and own our first renewable natural gas facility with a Michigan dairy farm, which is included in our pending gas rate case. This facility would be a regulated asset and the emissions reduction will remove the equivalent of 4,000 gasoline-fueled vehicles from the road annually. Clearly, we are on our way to a safe and clean gas system. Finally, I want to talk a little bit about Michigan, our home state, our service territory. In both our gas and electric business, we are seeing new service connections up over 2020 and 2019 above pre-pandemic levels. In fact, we have not seen this level of new electric service connections in the last 10 years. We also attracted 105 megawatts of new industrial loads to our service territory, which brings with it 4,000 new jobs and more than $1 billion of investment. And we are expecting even more new load growth in the state. The work we did at the end of the year on two important growth mechanisms further enhances, Michigan's competitive position.  We filed an economic development rate in November, which was quickly approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission in December. We also work closely with the legislature, business groups and the Governor's office on a package of economic development incentive bill that passed with bipartisan support signed by our Governor in December. With these improvements, I expect further announcements this year on several new projects. For you, our investors, I'm pleased to share we delivered our financial targets with another year of 7% adjusted EPS growth. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, $55 million of cost savings were realized in 2021. When I step back and reflect on 2021, it is this strong execution and results that you and we expect, and it meets our commitment to the triple bottom line, positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. Strong execution leads to strong results and 2021 marks another year of premium growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 in 2021 at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% from 2020. And in January, the Board approved an annual dividend increase to $1.84 per share. In addition to raising our annual dividend in 2022, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our 2022 adjusted full-year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 from $2.85 to $2.87 per share. I am confident in our plan for 2022 and our long-standing ability to manage the work and deliver industry-leading growth. Longer-term, we remain committed to growing adjusted EPS on the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share that we have rolled forward our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by over $1 billion to $14.3 billion through 2026. On Slide 5, we've highlighted our new five-year $14.3 billion customer investment plan. This translates 7% annual rate base growth and supports the two key focus areas of our strategy, making our electric and gas systems safer and more reliable and paving the way with clean energy future with Net Zero carbon and methane emissions. You will note that about 40% of our investment mix is aimed at renewable generation, grid modernization and main and service replacement on our gas system that support the clean energy transformation. Furthermore, we continue to increase our investments in what our customers count on us for every single day, safe and reliable electric and natural gas systems. You will also see that we continue to plan conservatively and have ample upside in projects not factored in this plan, such as our IRP and Voluntary Green Pricing program. We remain focused on the regulatory process as we make investment on behalf of our customers. In December, we received an order in our electric rate case. It offered several opportunities for us to improve our case process, and we are hard at work as we prepare our next phase.  This order did support our plan by maintaining our existing 9.9% ROE, increasing our regulatory equity ratio by 34 basis points and approving $54 million in revenue requirement exclusive of $27 million of lower depreciation approved prior to the order. We expect to file our next electric rate case early this year and anticipate an initial order in our IRP in April, and a final order in our gas rate case is expected by October. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2021 with adjusted net income of $767 million or $2.65 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2020 results. I'll note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items, most notably the financial performance of EnerBank, the gain on the sale and related transaction costs, all of which are disclosed in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this presentation and posted on our website. The key drivers of our full year financial performance in 2021 were rate relief, net of investments, coupled with strong volumetric sales in our electric business. These sources a positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer initiatives related to safety, reliability and decarbonization, and higher service restoration costs from storm activity. To this last point on storms, we saw a record level of storms across Michigan in 2021, particularly in the final five months of the year, including December, and we still managed to deliver at the high end of our EPS guidance range.  Our ability to withstand such headwinds quite literally in the case of 2021, and deliver the financial results you've come to expect highlights our track record of planning conservatively, managing the work and relying on the perennial will of our dedicated coworkers. We deliver on the triple bottom line irrespective of the conditions. Moving beyond EPS, on Slide 8, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. It is worth noting that even with the aforementioned headwinds, we still managed to deliver over $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our plan by over $80 million due to strong working capital management.  The only financial target missed in 2021 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for roughly $2.5 billion and we ended the year just shy of that at $2.3 billion, primarily due to the timing of select renewable projects, which were largely pushed into 2022 and 2023. To close the books on 2021, we successfully completed our financing plan ahead of schedule, as noted during our third quarter earnings call issuing no equity during the year, given the EnerBank sales while maintaining solid investment-grade credit metrics. Moving to our 2022 guidance, on Slide 9, we are raising our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.85 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.87 per share, which implies premium annual growth of our 2021 results, as Garrick highlighted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has in the past several years. And we also anticipate a return to normal operations in enterprises whose financial performance in 2021 was largely impacted by an extended outage at DIG late in the fourth quarter. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 10, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.01 per share of positive year-over-year variance. Additionally, we anticipate $0.05 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief net of investment costs, largely driven by our recent electric rate order and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case later this year. As a reminder, we also continue to see the residual effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. As we look at our cost structure in 2022, you'll note approximately $0.21 per share of positive variance attributable to continued cost savings from productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives as well as a return to more normalized levels of service restoration expense. As noted earlier, we're also assuming a resumption of normalized operating conditions in enterprises in the ultimate bar on the right-hand side of the chart, coupled with usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. Moving to Slide 11, which denotes our near and long term financial objectives. In addition to the adjusted earnings and dividend per share target that Garrick noted earlier, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, given the attractive valuation achieved in the EnerBank sale and our successful closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate issuing any equity through 2024, despite the increase in our five-year customer investment plan for $14.3 billion. Beyond 2024, we expect to issue up to $250 million of equity per year in 2025 and 2026. As for 2022 financings, our needs are limited to debt issuances at the utility and the settlement of existing equity forward contracts, the details of which you can find in the appendix of our presentation. Our model is served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and empowered in our purpose-driven organization. And our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about inflation, supply chain and natural gas prices, among other risks. And our answer remains the same, irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the waring for you. Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success over the past several years. And as you can see in the breakout of our cost structure on Slide 12, there remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business. As you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide, we estimate over $200 million of episodic cost savings opportunities through coal facility retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements, or PPAs.  In fact, our PPA with the Palisades Nuclear their facility will expire in April of this year, which will provide approximately $90 million of savings to our customers. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually largely through the CE Way, our lean operating system, which, as Garrick noted earlier, was a key driver in our achievement of $55 million in cost savings in 2021 and $100 million worth in 2020. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and invest. To conclude my remarks, on Slide 13, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimum. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before Q&A.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has withstood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we have achieved another year of strong performance in 2021, executing on our commitment with triple bottom line and are pleased with our strong results. I'm confident we're in a great position to continue our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we head into another exciting year. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nShar Pourreza: Good morning. Good stuff this morning. A couple of questions here if I may, first, Garrick, you're guiding to the top end of 6% to 8%, which was kind of a change in language post transformation, and now you kind of break out more details the upside potential for non-IRP CapEx. Just to confirm, is this upside included in the updated language around the growth rate? Maybe another way to ask is if you're already at the top end you have $4 billion to $5 billion of incremental spending items within sort of outside of the IRP. How do we think about this growth rate in the context of the upside spending opportunities you're highlighting this morning?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, great question, Shar. And let me offer this just real clarity and offer a little bit of context. And so we're pleased with 2021 and delivering the high end of guidance. And as I shared previously, we've got a lot of momentum coming into 2022, and our raise in guidance should offer much confidence to the investment community on our strength here in 2022 and our confidence in the delivery in 2022. I'll remind you that our 6% to 8%, again, towards the high end of that range, that's off a 2022 base. So that's our projection going forward. We plan conservatively. And so again, you see a lot of upside in that capital plan, the IRP, the VGP type work.  And so again, we'll weave those in as those materialize, we don't want to presume excess in those. That's why we are playing conservatively. But again, we expect to be the high end of that 2022 base. And so that's the nature of our growth pattern going forward. And I don't know, Rejji, do you want to offer some additional comments there as well?\nRejji Hayes: Good morning Shar, thanks for the question. The only thing I would add to Garrick's comment is just to be \u2013 or I guess, for the avoidance of doubt is that the guidance toward the high-end of 6% to 8% of the 2022 base, that just assumes the capital plan we rolled there today of $14.3 billion of that five-year period, and the assumption of no equity through 2024. And so these other opportunities on the outside looking at the end of the year accounted the IRP, the bond segment pricing program of AGP, those would give us a more confidence in delivering on that plan. So again delivery towards the high-end of 2022 is just based on the $14.3 billion of capital and the assumption of no equity through 2024. Those are the key drivers.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just to follow up. The rate base growth for 2026 is now 7%. It's a little bit of a slight change from prior year's language of \u201cgreater than 7%\u201d, it's subtle. Is there sort of a lot of large numbers taking effect here just as we're thinking about modeling?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. You certainly do have that because we're compounding off of a higher base, but it's a solid 7%, Shar. So I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And then just lastly for me, in terms of the disclosure for 2025 through 2026 on the equity side, obviously, you're restoring back the historical $250 million per year. I'm sure, Rejji, you're thinking about this, but do you see sort of any opportunities to maybe mitigate, find some optimization on the financing side, given that you're predominantly 100% regulated, maybe a way to flex the balance sheet and credit metrics? Is there a way you can offset this?\nRejji Hayes: We'll see. I mean, the current base case for modeling purposes should be $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. But what you'll see in the appendix chart is we are assuming about over $10.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the next five-years. And so if we see upside to that, well, that certainly gives us more financial flexibility. We've also really done a nice job executing very attractive, I'll say, equity-like securities that get an equity like the hybrids we've been doing from time-to-time. We had a perpetual preferred last year. They got nice equity credit. And we'll see if there are opportunities there. But the current working assumption should be that $350 million per year in those averages in 2025 and 2026.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Congrats on the execution. It's really good. Thanks.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning. How are you Jeremy?\nJeremy Tonet: Good, thanks. It seems very clear from the slides there's various CapEx upside that we could see. But just wondering if you could dive in a little bit more for the timing on when these items could make the way into plan and what we should be watching for there?\nGarrick Rochow: I assume you're talking about the incremental items and just to clarify your question?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes, the incremental CapEx opportunity.\nGarrick Rochow: Certainly. So as you know, we're in the midst of an integrated resource plan, and we don't want to presume, although we're confident in that plan. We don't want to presume the Covert facility and the big facility will move into the utility there's certainly a lot of pretty good indicators around that. But nonetheless, we want to make sure that that's where it lands. And we'll see a final order in the IRP by June of this year. And so again, assuming success there, we would anticipate the Covert facility in 2023 and then the DIG facilities out in 2025 from an incremental opportunity. Our VGP, again, that's subscription-based, based on customers. We saw some positive traction in that, we announced this week with General Motors. But again, that construction would be \u2013 as those fill out and those are subscribed, that construction period would be in 2024 to 2027. And so that's the nature of \u2013 as that materializes, it would show up in that range.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And if these come to fruition, would this impact, I guess, the funding plan on the equity side?\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, this is Rejji. For now, again, we feel good about the funding plan. And we had said before, in the event the IRP gets approved, we don't believe we need to materially change our equity issuance needs. Now the VGP plus the IRP, if we have those high-class problems, we would potentially have to recalibrate. But to be clear, that would only be outside of 2024. And so you think about the timing of the capital investments, Covert would potentially be before 2024. And again, we feel good about not needing to issue equity even in that scenario before 2024, where we may need to recalibrate as if \u2013 we get the IRP and good momentum on the VGP. Those outer years 2025 and beyond, we may have to take a second look there. But for now, again, we feel very good about the work assumptions of this plan.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And just a quick last one, if I could. With regards to the electric rate case here, the outcome might have been a bit lighter than expected. And just wondering if you could comment a bit more, I guess, on the go-forward expectations in Michigan as far as the regulatory construct there as well as the specific drivers in 2022 that you're using to employ to kind of offset some of that softness?\nGarrick Rochow: Rejji and I will take team this. Let me be very clear. I feel good about the regulatory construct here in Michigan. And when I look at this rate case, there are two things to take away from it. One, there's an investor read-through on a strong and constructive ROE, 9.9%. That has been constructive, especially when compared with other jurisdictions. It's good solid equity thickness. In fact, our regulatory equity ratio grew by 34 basis points. That just, again, speaks to the nature of this commission in this regulatory construct. And again, all based in legislation, so don't forget that piece of it as well. The other piece of opportunity is clear in the order. And as a utility, we need to improve our business cases particularly in a forward-looking test year and the additional investments we want to make on behalf of our customer. We need to do a better job of showing the benefits as well as the cost when compared to historical. That's on us. We own that and you can expect to see it in our next electric rate case. So let me hand it over to Rejji to walk through a little bit of why we have such confidence in 2022.\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, so as you think about the offset with the order or from the order, clearly, it really highlights the benefits of having a forward test year. And so where we had disallowances in that forward test year, we obviously can revise our capital and spend programs. And so that's a clear offset from some of the disallowances we saw. And then a couple of things related to 2021 and then in this test year so that gives us great confidence. And so as you may recall, we had plans to issue equity in 2021. And obviously, given the timing of the EnerBank sale, we didn't have to issue any equity that year.  And so we've got some momentum from a share count perspective. That's helpful. I continue to feel quite good about weather-normalized load. We saw a really nice recovery from commercial and industrial sales over the course of 2021, and we anticipate seeing some of that in 2022 as well, particularly given the leading indicators that we've seen with respect to new service requests, which Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, and we continue to see upside from our residential customers given the sort of teleworking phenomenon that we think should stick to some extent. And then cost performance. Every year, I continue to be surprised to the upside by what the organization can deliver. So last year, our plan was about $45 million. and we delivered $55 million there. And then in 2020, I can assure you we didn't plan for $100 million of savings in the organization went and got it. And so those are all the drivers that we think will offset some of the downs that we saw in the electric rate order.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Yes. Thank you. My first question, you guys dealt with a lot of storms, especially in 2021. And I think in the last rate case, they were also just conversations about potential spending capital opportunities versus just use the expensing to \u2013 for restoration and whatnot. Did the more string of storms more recently identify any additional needs on the capital side that you think could be added to your go-forward plans?\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Insoo, and good morning. I want to be real clear with everyone here. We're at the largest electric reliability capital spend that we've had in our company's history, and it's actually 40% over 2020. So we're at a good pace in terms of electric reliability. But clearly, as we demonstrated in this electric rate case, there is more to do across our vast system. And so we'll be making requests in this upcoming electric rate case with, of course, better business justification to be able to support that. Clearly, when you look at our system and the amount of storms we had this year, there is room to \u2013 for improvement, and we're well aligned with this commission and this staff to do just that.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Second question is just going back to the demand comments you guys made. For 2022, if I understand correctly, you're thinking more of a modest flat to modest growth and year-over-year growth. Is that correct? And then two, just you've talked about the positive signals. Is there any particular segment or industries that you're seeing that out of?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Insoo, this is Rejji. So yes, I think your working assumption for blended weather-normalized load on the electric side is about right. So call it just slightly up, flat to about 0.5 point. But again, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing on the residential side. So last year, we had \u2013 we assumed a pretty aggressive return to work, and we ultimately saw our residential down about 2.5%, a little over that versus 2020. Our plan was much more bearish. And so we saw a surprise to the upside versus plan there. Commercial, we've already seen commercial over the case of 2021, up about 3.3%. So effectively back at this point to pre-pandemic levels when you take energy waste reduction into account. And industrial, I'd say admittedly, it's still coming back, and that's why we feel good about 2022. And so when you think about our working assumptions for 2022, we're still assuming a decline for residential versus 2021, about somewhere between 1% to 2%. Commercial basically, flat to slightly up. And then industrial, we still expect to see pretty good growth there around 5%. So that's what, on a blended basis gets you to around a point \u2013 I'm sorry, excuse me, flat to slightly up about 0.5 point all in. And then the positive signal to new service requests, to point to a specific sector, I think, would be challenging because we're pretty diversified in our service territory. But clearly, we're seeing good news in auto. Now again, auto represents a couple of percent of our gross margins. So not a great deal of exposure there. But across most sectors, we expect to continue to see Michigan trend well. And as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, we're seeing some very attractive economic development opportunities on the industrial side. We're not in a position right now to disclose those sectors, but we see a number of I'll say, a combination of old and new economy sectors, looking at Michigan as a place to land. And so we feel very good about the road ahead economically in Michigan.\nInsoo Kim: That\u2019s a good color. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, Garrick, just first wanted to ask on level of conviction and ability to potentially settle the IRP in the next couple of weeks or months here?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So I'm just going to break this down really, really clearly. I feel good about taking it a little distance. I want to make sure that's very clear. And the way I'm just \u2013 I'm sharing my thinking about this is there's $650 million of savings for our customers. That's on the table. There's a 60% reduction in carbon by 2025 over 2005 baseline levels. And there's an opportunity for more resilient supply system. Those are the factors of this. And so there's good \u2013 there's a win \u2013 I've said this before, there's a win here for everyone. And so we feel very strong about taking the full length and get what we need for our customers as well as for our investors. But bottom line, whether it's an electric case, gas case or an IRP, we're going to look at an opportunity to settle. And right now, we're in a sweet spot where there's an opportunity to do that. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's an opportunity to a partial settlement or a full sentiment. And so we'll look at that and we'll work with the parties to see if something can materialize there. But just like there's an opportunity there, all those wins allow us to take the full distance as well. So I feel confident either way that we'll get what we need for our customers to plan it and for our shareholders. Is that helpful, Michael?\nMichael Sullivan: Yes, super helpful. Thank you. And my other question was, Rejji, I think you mentioned one of the main drivers for the lower than planned CapEx last year with some slippage on renewables projects. Can you just give a little more detail on that?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Michael. Good morning. Yes. So we had some renewable projects that we had to push out a little bit. I think the issues around supply chain pretty well publicized across not just the country but the planet. And so we saw some of that with respect to our projects. We still expect to get the projects executed over time, but we did have to push them out a little bit. So that was really the primary driver. And I'd say across some projects, there were some idiosyncratic issues that came up, but it was largely related to supply chain matters.\nGarrick Rochow: Mike, can I just jump in on this one as well. I've been involved in large power plants and operations for 25-plus years. I don't think there's been a year in those 25 where I haven't seen projects move from year to year. Major projects in terms of outages, in terms of construction time lines differed. And so it's pretty typical in our industry to have a little give and take. And so this supply chain challenge that's in front of us will dissipate over time, I have no doubt about that. But remember this, we're retiring coal. And so you have to fill that capacity somehow. So these projects aren't going away. It's just a matter of when we plant them in what year. And so again, this is pretty typical for the work we do year after year, this give and take. And so I'm not worried, not concerned, and this too will pass.\nMichael Sullivan: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Weisel: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question on the new CapEx plan, I see that excludes the $1 billion from the voluntary renewables program. My question is, you've been using that $1 billion number for a little while now, shouldn't that be higher given the new customers you signed up? And I understand understanding might be in kind of the later years of the plan. But should that number be a bigger one?\nGarrick Rochow: So the $1 billion equates to 1,000 megawatts of renewables. And so the way this works is customers have prescribed to that, and we have a certain number of subscriptions, we build out that. And so the 1,000 megawatt equates to the $1 billion. And so does that help, Andrew?\nAndrew Weisel: And remind me for how many megawatts are you up to sign that now?\nGarrick Rochow: We've got \u2013 this program started at 120 megawatts. That is fully subscribed, and we're now in the second phase of subscribing the 1,000 megawatts.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Got it. So you still got a little ways to get to that $1 billion. Okay. Great. My next question is, if I compare the old CapEx plan to the new one, it seems \u2013 I understand there's a roll forward, but it seems like your electric spending is down by about $0.5 billion and gas spending is up by about $1 billion. Is that a conscious shift in strategy? Or is that just the output of a bottoms-up budget building process?\nGarrick Rochow: It's really a bottoms-up piece. And just let me offer a little bit in the gas. Back in November of 2020, we got a large pipeline project approved through an Act 9, which is the equivalent of a certificate of necessity that is folded into this plan. And so as you might imagine, the replacing 56 miles of large transmission pipe, the project is around five \u2013 I think it's $550 million in that range. And so that's a big factor that as you build that bottoms-up approach, it shows up in the gas and in this vintage of capital in Apple five-year plan.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Then just one last one, if I could squeeze it in. On the relative growth between the earnings and the dividend, you're targeting the high end of 6% to 8% for earnings. And I know your targeted dividend payout ratio is 60% versus about 64% in 2022. You just announced a 5.7% dividend increase. Is that a pace that we should expect for the next couple of years until you get to that 50% ratio?\nRejji Hayes: Andrew, yes, this is Rejji. So yes, I think conceptually, you're right in that you're going to see a decoupling at least in the short term between the earnings growth and the dividend per share growth. And so that's what we're showing with this recent increase in the dividend because we did mention on the heels of the EnerBank sale that we'll guide down \u2013 we'll glide path down to a low 60s percent payout ratio. Right now, we're kind of mid-60s and we'll glide path down over time. So you'll see a little decoupling between the earnings growth, which will be a little bit stronger than dividend per share growth, but we still think both are healthy and combined offer very attractive total shareholder return proposition.\nAndrew Weisel: Definitely. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Well done. So perhaps just coming back to a couple of things. The economic development tariffs, just to come to that first here, how do you think about that impacting 2022? Just you mentioned pretty strong industrial load. Obviously, the economic development tariffs kind of impact shift those impacts and load sensitivity to earnings sensitivity. Can you talk a little bit about what that could do? I imagine it's not too material, but curious.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So let me offer a little more color on these economics. There's two pieces. We were very successful toward the end of the year and establish an economic development rate. We filed that in November. And as I said, almost record approval here with the commission and the Public Service Commission and staff, which we see as a really good indicator here in Michigan and the opportunity to encourage job growth in jobs here in Michigan. So it's an economic development rate, which is very competitive out there, and it's designed for energy-intensive customers. The next piece is we work to achieve economic set of bills that offered incentives, to make Michigan competitive. That was offered through, again, bipartisan support through the legislature signed by the Governor, that was close to $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incentives here in the state. And so GM made their big announcement, nearly $7 billion of investment in Michigan, 4,000 new jobs. That is a direct result of that work. And so we feel good by the initial valley here. But as Rejji said, there's \u2013 and I shared in my prepared remarks, there are more that are considering Michigan, and so we see a lot of upside from an industrial and jobs growth perspective and ultimately, the spillover benefits. But Rejji, I don't know if you want to add any additional context to that at all?\nRejji Hayes: No, I think you laid it out well, Garrick.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right. So we'll see what happens this year. Perhaps if I could pivot on Campbell, just super quick, if I can. Campbell retirement, as you've alluded to several times already, a retirement, the 2025 time frame, that's come up a lot in the IRP and represents a substantive portion of the O&M savings. I think it's order of magnitude, $60 million. Do you offset for this retirement? And again, as you think about it, if it is pushed back, for instance, in an IRP settlement? Or again, how you would think about that fitting into your plan to the extent to which that moves out, if you will?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, in my earlier comments, just to be really clear, $650 million of savings in total requires the retirement of Campbell one, two and three. And start of my career at that plant, you can't do a partial there. It just doesn't work. And so you need the whole thing. One, for the savings piece for our customers, but you can't do a partial retirement. So that's critically important in this equation in this IRP. The second piece is, when you retire a plant like that, you need to backfill in terms of capacity, in terms of energy. And the lowest cost option on that, we proved their modeling is to Covert and through the DIG facilities. And so again, this is why it all comes together quite nicely. And so it's very clear what's necessary to do this type of savings for our customers, to improve the supply side from a resiliency perspective and then also to have a 60% reduction in carbon. So that's how we're approaching it. Again, a lot of benefits, a lot of wins for every one, and we think we can achieve that \u2013 not that I think. We know we can achieve that here in 2022.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. And just even further to clarify that, your core base plan, it doesn't reflect Campbell per se. The IRP, should we say, upside as we talked about from a capital perspective, and making that affordable is predicated on Campbell, right, just to segment that apart?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. We need Campbell. We need all of Campbell to retire. And again, that's not built into our plans. Now our five-year plan at all, not the savings, not the capital upside. It's not in the plan. So just to be clear there.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent guys. I wish you a best of luck which would happen in Michigan, I am curious.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Nick Campanella of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nNick Campanella: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nNick Campanella: Hey. So most of my questions have been answered, but I just wanted to go back to the electric rate case quick, absolutely acknowledge, really healthy ROE and equity ratio. The commission did seem to push back on capital costs, specifically with that one solar project, I guess, at least for this order. Can you confirm you're moving forward with that project still? How should we think about subsequent approvals in your clean energy generation capital plan? Understanding it's obviously imperative for the company's decarbonization goals, but the commission does seem to be taking a slower approach to at least your initial set of projects here. Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: I don't agree with that conclusion that they're taking a slower approach. The language is really clear in the ex parte order and in electric rate case, other support for green energy. And in fact, that washing project, and it's clear that it's been supported and from a construction standpoint and a regulatory recovery standpoint. Now Rejji will walk through a little bit of the financial piece and how we'll progress with that project here over the course of 2022 and 2023.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Nick. So again, to Garrick's point, we feel very confident that it was really a deferred decision by the commission because they did approve the contract in November before electric rate order and the only reason it wasn't approved in the orders, just given the timing of which it was introduced into the case, we do expect to get a constructive outcome in a subsequent filing. And so as a result of that, to Garrick's point, we'll continue to execute on the project. And because of the high probability of approval will recognize AFUDC equity and debt accounting on this project. And so there will be no P&L drag if you will, and just a little bit of deferred cash flow or lag on the cash flow side. And so we fully expect to move forward on the project and again, expect a constructive outcome in a subsequent case. Is that helpful?\nNick Campanella: Yes. That's very clear. I appreciate the time today. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold at Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: Just a quick question, again, on the five-year plan, thanks for the clarity on what's driving the step-up in the gas side that was clearer. I'm just curious, though, on the electric distribution line. It seemed to take a pretty meaningful step down in 2022. And we're sort of \u2013 I think that will explain most of the delta. Can you square that, Garrick, with your comments about customer growth and new connections and the like and maybe sort of \u2013 maybe the rate case is partly the answer but just curious.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, specifically for new growth, both electric connections and we have a deferral mechanism on there. And so we can allocate the appropriate amount of capital for growth. And then see recovery in a subsequent case. And so that\u2019s \u2013 perhaps we have had at least the last couple of rate cases that allow us to \u2013 it\u2019s in three areas, both in new business at the relocations and demand capital. And so that's been very helpful in allowing us to expand our electric capital in year as a result of changes in the environment like great business growth. And so that's an important piece. The other piece that I would just, again, point back to, our electric reliability spend is robust. It's the largest we've had here across our company, 40% over 2020. But I would offer this, there's better and more important work we need to do in this next electric rate case. We have more capital that we want to invest on behalf of our customers and electric reliability to offer benefits and improve our performance there. and we'll work to engage that into the \u2013 to build that out in the next case. And I know Rejji would offer \u2013 also offer some comments as well.\nRejji Hayes: Jonathan, the only thing I'd add, you noted that there was a slight dip in the front end of the five-year plan on the distribution spend. So you can see it a little off trend. We tend to and have historically been at about $1 billion per year spend rate for all the reliability work that we know needs to get done in our service territory. The dip in 2022 that's attributable to just aligning the spend plan in 2022 with the rate order. We had about around $100 million or so or thereabouts of disallowance in the rate order. And so obviously with the forward test year, we can toggle our plans accordingly. And so that's really what's driving some of that decline in 2022, which is a little off trend.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay, great. That's perfect. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning, thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Travis.\nTravis Miller: Back to the IRP. Just thinking about timing post IRP, would you get a decision soon enough or have concrete plans soon enough to weave anything from the IRP into the presumed electric rate case that filing this year?\nGarrick Rochow: Our electric \u2013 we're going to file our electric rate case here in April timeframe. And so that's our plan right now. And so we don't anticipate \u2013 initial order could come out very earliest in April and then a final order in June. And so I don't anticipate that'll be woven into this electric rate case.\nTravis Miller: Okay. What is your thought on timing of maybe specific projects or capital at least generally from the IRP, a year out, six months out from the decision? What's your thought there?\nGarrick Rochow: Our intent here is to, so again, I don't want to presume approval. I think that would be, I don't get in front of the commission on that. But again, confidence in of a final order by June, and let's play this out Covert dig into the utility. We'd looked to update our plans, our five-year plans and the kind of the normal cycle to reflect those changes.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Perfect. And then real quick on the enterprise side, any update to the strategy there?\nGarrick Rochow: Enterprises continues to be an important part of our business, although it was really a small part of our business. And just as a reminder for everyone on the call, it's about 4% of our earnings mix. So again, small and then as big in other facilities move into the utility that enterprise group grows as even smaller. Right now, it's focused on renewables and customer relationships. And so let me offer a little bit more context around that. For example, a company like General Motors or one of the companies that Enterprise works with. They have long-term commitment to sustainability across their global footprint. And so they provide a creditworthy party and we have a long contract period. We help them find renewable assets throughout the U.S. And so that's the role we play. We see utility-like returns or better in that space. And again, we're not out in the auctions. We're not out being squeezed from a margin perspective. It's specifically designed at customer relationships and helping them meet their sustainability targets. And so it's narrow, it's thoughtful. It's a small part of our business but important for our strategic customers.\nTravis Miller: Great. Thanks so much. That\u2019s all I have.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning. Hopefully, just two quick ones. And I don't know if I'm reading too deep into this, but I think of the 2021 actual at 265, the range you gave for 2022 of 185 to 189. The midpoint there is not actually towards the high end of the six, it's actually above the high end and this is before any of the additional capital team that you're actually not even trending towards the high end, you're above the high end. Is this just smaller numbers and moving a decimal place here or there? Or is there more to read through to this?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, here's the good news, Anthony. You said 185 to 189, it's 285.\nAnthony Crowdell: 285. Apologies. It's a long morning. Apologies.\nGarrick Rochow: No problem. So again, we're happy with where we landed this year, and we've got a lot of momentum coming into the year. And for some of the reasons that Rejji articulated earlier, but you may want to jump in again on this one. But bottom line, we've offered guidance there. We feel we've expanded and raised that guidance and feel good about \u2013 really good and confident about landing there. And as I shared earlier, likely in the midpoint range, a lot of year left, but in the midpoint of that range we offer today. And so again \u2013 and then after this and really into 2022, that is the base here, we'll grow at that 6% to 8% towards the high side. Anything else to offer on that Rejji?\nRejji Hayes: No, I think you have the key point, Garrick, which is the 6% to 8% guidance, Anthony, and that sort of confidence toward the high end, that is off of the 2022 base. And so I think 2023 and beyond, 2022 is a fairly atypical year. Again, given the sale of the bank, and that's why you see a little bit higher growth in the range of 285 to 289 off of the 2021 actuals of 265. It implies like 7.5% to 9%, but we don't foresee ourselves growing at that clip going forward. So it's just an atypical year as we reduce the dilution from the EnerBank sale and redeploy the capital.\nAnthony Crowdell: What has to happen for you guys to hit the 6%? Like why even to 6% there? It seems that you guys are really fully loaded 7% to 8%. I'm just curious what's the scenario where you come in to the 6% like why not remove it, I guess, is my question?\nRejji Hayes: Well, I mean, even though the range may seem wide on a percentage basis, it's about 4% to 5% on average, Anthony. And so we think that, that's plenty conservative to give us a little room to land the plane. So we feel good about the guidance range, which, again, I think is one of the tightest in the sector.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And just last for me. I think you said gigs, the plant was \u2013 had an extended outage 2021. Just what was the issue? And is that plant back in service?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. The quick answer is back in service. There was a supply line of gas that was feeding into the plant that needed some additional construction work. And having been in the gas business for a long time, we know once that type of work is done, lasts about 70 years or so. So we feel good about the fact that, that was nonrecurring and we'll be back at normal operations going forward for the foreseeable future. But just to be clear, it wasn't our gas line, it was from a third party, but that's now fixed, and we're off and running.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Paul Patterson at Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Hey, how it\u2019s going?\nGarrick Rochow: It\u2019s going well, Paul. Thanks.\nPaul Patterson: Just \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this, but the normalized storm impact for 2021 that you guys \u2013 and I guess the delta that you guys are thinking, I see that you're combining it with customer initiatives. How much was this still \u2013 what do you think about in terms of \u2013 how should we think about storms this year, I mean, in 2021 versus 2022?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Paul, thanks for the question. So we've seen at least over the last four or five years, an increase in sort of a, I'll say, the volume and the intensity of storms. And so service restoration has been somewhat volatile. Last year, I'd say, was atypical even relative to the last few years. And so I think if you look back from, say, pre-pandemic levels to 2020. We were on a spend rate of somewhere around $70 million to $80 million. And then 2021, we were a multiple on top of that, I think, almost 2x to 3x that \u2013 not 3x, but closer to 2x. And so we just don't foresee a level of service restoration at those levels in 2022. So we expect to be sort of \u2013 I think we have in rates about $65 million. So we may be a little north of that when all is said and done this year, but we certainly don't think we'll see numbers in excess of $100 million, $150 million, which is where we were last year. So that's how we're thinking about it, sort of more towards where we are in rates and maybe slightly above that. Is that helpful?\nPaul Patterson: Very helpful. And then just with respect to COVID, I mean it looks like you guys have done very well during it and it looks \u2013 you gave a lot of information on the usage and everything. But I'm just wondering, is it kind of \u2013 are we sort of \u2013 is COVID kind of a nonissue at this point, should we think about in terms of 2022 and going forward? I mean, obviously, you can't predict the pandemic. But I mean, I'm sort of saying, I mean, how do you think of COVID impacting stuff, I guess, in 2022?\nGarrick Rochow: I don't want to minimize COVID or the health effects to people. And so probably sensitive to my response here. But bottom line, what we've \u2013 in Michigan here, we're seeing all the economic indicators are headed in the right direction. And then people have figured out a way to be able to work and live and even play in the midst of a pandemic. And as a company, we found ways to work safely with the appropriate precautions in place. And so again, we're not seeing what we saw at the beginning of the pandemic, which was economic shutdowns and other factors influencing load. It's really on the upswing. And all economic indicators are, again, headed in the right direction. And so I would put it in more of a perspective that we figured out how to work within the context of COVID.\nPaul Patterson: Okay, great. I really appreciate it. Thanks so much\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rocco, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today for our fourth quartile earnings call. Take care and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. Have a wonderful day. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2021 with adjusted net income of $767 million or $2.65 per share, up 7% year-over-year of our 2020 results. I'll note that our adjusted EPS excludes select nonrecurring items, most notably the financial performance of EnerBank, the gain on the sale and related transaction costs, all of which are disclosed in the reconciliation schedule in the appendix of this presentation and posted on our website. The key drivers of our full year financial performance in 2021 were rate relief, net of investments, coupled with strong volumetric sales in our electric business. These sources a positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer initiatives related to safety, reliability and decarbonization, and higher service restoration costs from storm activity. To this last point on storms, we saw a record level of storms across Michigan in 2021, particularly in the final five months of the year, including December, and we still managed to deliver at the high end of our EPS guidance range.  Our ability to withstand such headwinds quite literally in the case of 2021, and deliver the financial results you've come to expect highlights our track record of planning conservatively, managing the work and relying on the perennial will of our dedicated coworkers. We deliver on the triple bottom line irrespective of the conditions. Moving beyond EPS, on Slide 8, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. It is worth noting that even with the aforementioned headwinds, we still managed to deliver over $1.8 billion of operating cash flow, which exceeded our plan by over $80 million due to strong working capital management.  The only financial target missed in 2021 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for roughly $2.5 billion and we ended the year just shy of that at $2.3 billion, primarily due to the timing of select renewable projects, which were largely pushed into 2022 and 2023. To close the books on 2021, we successfully completed our financing plan ahead of schedule, as noted during our third quarter earnings call issuing no equity during the year, given the EnerBank sales while maintaining solid investment-grade credit metrics. Moving to our 2022 guidance, on Slide 9, we are raising our 2022 adjusted earnings guidance to $2.85 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.87 per share, which implies premium annual growth of our 2021 results, as Garrick highlighted. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has in the past several years. And we also anticipate a return to normal operations in enterprises whose financial performance in 2021 was largely impacted by an extended outage at DIG late in the fourth quarter. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 10, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.01 per share of positive year-over-year variance. Additionally, we anticipate $0.05 of EPS pickup attributable to rate relief net of investment costs, largely driven by our recent electric rate order and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas case later this year. As a reminder, we also continue to see the residual effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. As we look at our cost structure in 2022, you'll note approximately $0.21 per share of positive variance attributable to continued cost savings from productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives as well as a return to more normalized levels of service restoration expense. As noted earlier, we're also assuming a resumption of normalized operating conditions in enterprises in the ultimate bar on the right-hand side of the chart, coupled with usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions and circumstances throughout the year to mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of meeting our operational and financial objectives. Moving to Slide 11, which denotes our near and long term financial objectives. In addition to the adjusted earnings and dividend per share target that Garrick noted earlier, from a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, given the attractive valuation achieved in the EnerBank sale and our successful closing of the transaction in the fourth quarter, we do not anticipate issuing any equity through 2024, despite the increase in our five-year customer investment plan for $14.3 billion. Beyond 2024, we expect to issue up to $250 million of equity per year in 2025 and 2026. As for 2022 financings, our needs are limited to debt issuances at the utility and the settlement of existing equity forward contracts, the details of which you can find in the appendix of our presentation. Our model is served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, while our coworkers remain engaged, well trained and empowered in our purpose-driven organization. And our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. We're often asked whether we can sustain our consistent industry-leading growth in the long term, given widespread concerns about inflation, supply chain and natural gas prices, among other risks. And our answer remains the same, irrespective of the circumstances, we view it as our job to do the waring for you. Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success over the past several years. And as you can see in the breakout of our cost structure on Slide 12, there remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business. As you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide, we estimate over $200 million of episodic cost savings opportunities through coal facility retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements, or PPAs.  In fact, our PPA with the Palisades Nuclear their facility will expire in April of this year, which will provide approximately $90 million of savings to our customers. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually largely through the CE Way, our lean operating system, which, as Garrick noted earlier, was a key driver in our achievement of $55 million in cost savings in 2021 and $100 million worth in 2020. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and invest. To conclude my remarks, on Slide 13, we have refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan are minimum. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before Q&A. Good morning Shar, thanks for the question. The only thing I would add to Garrick's comment is just to be \u2013 or I guess, for the avoidance of doubt is that the guidance toward the high-end of 6% to 8% of the 2022 base, that just assumes the capital plan we rolled there today of $14.3 billion of that five-year period, and the assumption of no equity through 2024. And so these other opportunities on the outside looking at the end of the year accounted the IRP, the bond segment pricing program of AGP, those would give us a more confidence in delivering on that plan. So again delivery towards the high-end of 2022 is just based on the $14.3 billion of capital and the assumption of no equity through 2024. Those are the key drivers. Yes. You certainly do have that because we're compounding off of a higher base, but it's a solid 7%, Shar. So I wouldn't read too much into it. We'll see. I mean, the current base case for modeling purposes should be $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. But what you'll see in the appendix chart is we are assuming about over $10.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the next five-years. And so if we see upside to that, well, that certainly gives us more financial flexibility. We've also really done a nice job executing very attractive, I'll say, equity-like securities that get an equity like the hybrids we've been doing from time-to-time. We had a perpetual preferred last year. They got nice equity credit. And we'll see if there are opportunities there. But the current working assumption should be that $350 million per year in those averages in 2025 and 2026. Thank you. Jeremy, this is Rejji. For now, again, we feel good about the funding plan. And we had said before, in the event the IRP gets approved, we don't believe we need to materially change our equity issuance needs. Now the VGP plus the IRP, if we have those high-class problems, we would potentially have to recalibrate. But to be clear, that would only be outside of 2024. And so you think about the timing of the capital investments, Covert would potentially be before 2024. And again, we feel good about not needing to issue equity even in that scenario before 2024, where we may need to recalibrate as if \u2013 we get the IRP and good momentum on the VGP. Those outer years 2025 and beyond, we may have to take a second look there. But for now, again, we feel very good about the work assumptions of this plan. Jeremy, so as you think about the offset with the order or from the order, clearly, it really highlights the benefits of having a forward test year. And so where we had disallowances in that forward test year, we obviously can revise our capital and spend programs. And so that's a clear offset from some of the disallowances we saw. And then a couple of things related to 2021 and then in this test year so that gives us great confidence. And so as you may recall, we had plans to issue equity in 2021. And obviously, given the timing of the EnerBank sale, we didn't have to issue any equity that year.  And so we've got some momentum from a share count perspective. That's helpful. I continue to feel quite good about weather-normalized load. We saw a really nice recovery from commercial and industrial sales over the course of 2021, and we anticipate seeing some of that in 2022 as well, particularly given the leading indicators that we've seen with respect to new service requests, which Garrick offered in his prepared remarks, and we continue to see upside from our residential customers given the sort of teleworking phenomenon that we think should stick to some extent. And then cost performance. Every year, I continue to be surprised to the upside by what the organization can deliver. So last year, our plan was about $45 million. and we delivered $55 million there. And then in 2020, I can assure you we didn't plan for $100 million of savings in the organization went and got it. And so those are all the drivers that we think will offset some of the downs that we saw in the electric rate order. Thank you. Yes, Insoo, this is Rejji. So yes, I think your working assumption for blended weather-normalized load on the electric side is about right. So call it just slightly up, flat to about 0.5 point. But again, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing on the residential side. So last year, we had \u2013 we assumed a pretty aggressive return to work, and we ultimately saw our residential down about 2.5%, a little over that versus 2020. Our plan was much more bearish. And so we saw a surprise to the upside versus plan there. Commercial, we've already seen commercial over the case of 2021, up about 3.3%. So effectively back at this point to pre-pandemic levels when you take energy waste reduction into account. And industrial, I'd say admittedly, it's still coming back, and that's why we feel good about 2022. And so when you think about our working assumptions for 2022, we're still assuming a decline for residential versus 2021, about somewhere between 1% to 2%. Commercial basically, flat to slightly up. And then industrial, we still expect to see pretty good growth there around 5%. So that's what, on a blended basis gets you to around a point \u2013 I'm sorry, excuse me, flat to slightly up about 0.5 point all in. And then the positive signal to new service requests, to point to a specific sector, I think, would be challenging because we're pretty diversified in our service territory. But clearly, we're seeing good news in auto. Now again, auto represents a couple of percent of our gross margins. So not a great deal of exposure there. But across most sectors, we expect to continue to see Michigan trend well. And as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks, we're seeing some very attractive economic development opportunities on the industrial side. We're not in a position right now to disclose those sectors, but we see a number of I'll say, a combination of old and new economy sectors, looking at Michigan as a place to land. And so we feel very good about the road ahead economically in Michigan. Yes, Michael. Good morning. Yes. So we had some renewable projects that we had to push out a little bit. I think the issues around supply chain pretty well publicized across not just the country but the planet. And so we saw some of that with respect to our projects. We still expect to get the projects executed over time, but we did have to push them out a little bit. So that was really the primary driver. And I'd say across some projects, there were some idiosyncratic issues that came up, but it was largely related to supply chain matters. Andrew, yes, this is Rejji. So yes, I think conceptually, you're right in that you're going to see a decoupling at least in the short term between the earnings growth and the dividend per share growth. And so that's what we're showing with this recent increase in the dividend because we did mention on the heels of the EnerBank sale that we'll guide down \u2013 we'll glide path down to a low 60s percent payout ratio. Right now, we're kind of mid-60s and we'll glide path down over time. So you'll see a little decoupling between the earnings growth, which will be a little bit stronger than dividend per share growth, but we still think both are healthy and combined offer very attractive total shareholder return proposition. No, I think you laid it out well, Garrick. Yes, Nick. So again, to Garrick's point, we feel very confident that it was really a deferred decision by the commission because they did approve the contract in November before electric rate order and the only reason it wasn't approved in the orders, just given the timing of which it was introduced into the case, we do expect to get a constructive outcome in a subsequent filing. And so as a result of that, to Garrick's point, we'll continue to execute on the project. And because of the high probability of approval will recognize AFUDC equity and debt accounting on this project. And so there will be no P&L drag if you will, and just a little bit of deferred cash flow or lag on the cash flow side. And so we fully expect to move forward on the project and again, expect a constructive outcome in a subsequent case. Is that helpful? Jonathan, the only thing I'd add, you noted that there was a slight dip in the front end of the five-year plan on the distribution spend. So you can see it a little off trend. We tend to and have historically been at about $1 billion per year spend rate for all the reliability work that we know needs to get done in our service territory. The dip in 2022 that's attributable to just aligning the spend plan in 2022 with the rate order. We had about around $100 million or so or thereabouts of disallowance in the rate order. And so obviously with the forward test year, we can toggle our plans accordingly. And so that's really what's driving some of that decline in 2022, which is a little off trend. No, I think you have the key point, Garrick, which is the 6% to 8% guidance, Anthony, and that sort of confidence toward the high end, that is off of the 2022 base. And so I think 2023 and beyond, 2022 is a fairly atypical year. Again, given the sale of the bank, and that's why you see a little bit higher growth in the range of 285 to 289 off of the 2021 actuals of 265. It implies like 7.5% to 9%, but we don't foresee ourselves growing at that clip going forward. So it's just an atypical year as we reduce the dilution from the EnerBank sale and redeploy the capital. Well, I mean, even though the range may seem wide on a percentage basis, it's about 4% to 5% on average, Anthony. And so we think that, that's plenty conservative to give us a little room to land the plane. So we feel good about the guidance range, which, again, I think is one of the tightest in the sector. Yes. The quick answer is back in service. There was a supply line of gas that was feeding into the plant that needed some additional construction work. And having been in the gas business for a long time, we know once that type of work is done, lasts about 70 years or so. So we feel good about the fact that, that was nonrecurring and we'll be back at normal operations going forward for the foreseeable future. But just to be clear, it wasn't our gas line, it was from a third party, but that's now fixed, and we're off and running. Thank you. Yes, Paul, thanks for the question. So we've seen at least over the last four or five years, an increase in sort of a, I'll say, the volume and the intensity of storms. And so service restoration has been somewhat volatile. Last year, I'd say, was atypical even relative to the last few years. And so I think if you look back from, say, pre-pandemic levels to 2020. We were on a spend rate of somewhere around $70 million to $80 million. And then 2021, we were a multiple on top of that, I think, almost 2x to 3x that \u2013 not 3x, but closer to 2x. And so we just don't foresee a level of service restoration at those levels in 2022. So we expect to be sort of \u2013 I think we have in rates about $65 million. So we may be a little north of that when all is said and done this year, but we certainly don't think we'll see numbers in excess of $100 million, $150 million, which is where we were last year. So that's how we're thinking about it, sort of more towards where we are in rates and maybe slightly above that. Is that helpful?"

            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that the team continued to deliver strong performance in 2021, demonstrating consistent results across the triple bottom line for our coworkers, customers, communities, and you, our investors. Allow me to take a few minutes to share the big wins this team accomplished in 2021. It is a point of pride that CMS was named the number one utility in the U.S. by Forbes for women and for workplace diversity. It starts with our coworkers and we know that companies that value and practice diversity, equity and inclusion deliver stronger performance. Our commitment to people, our coworkers and customers was in high year all year. For our coworkers, we delivered the 11th straight year of first quartile employee engagement. For our customers, we delivered first quartile customer experience, unlocks several programs, which support our most vulnerable and prepare all for a cleaner future with EVs and renewable energy generation. This year's highlights include the expansion of our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which allows for an incremental 1,000 megawatts of owned renewables and our PowerMIFleet EV program to meet the demand of Michigan businesses governments and schools as they electrify their fleet. And just this week, we announced along with General Motors, the plan to power three existing auto plants with 100% clean energy through our Voluntary Green Pricing program. And I know \u2013 Yes. Yes, I know all of you want to hear about our IRP. Our clean energy plan, also known as our IRP, places us in a solid leadership position on the transformation to clean energy. It has us out of coal by 2025, which achieves 60% carbon emissions reduction. I am pleased with the progress we are seeing in the regulatory process. I look forward to landing the IRP in 2022. I also want to share the progress we have made with our gas system. Our commitment to be Net Zero methane by 2030 is industry leading. We are making our gas system safer and cleaner by replacing older mains and services with modern materials. This year, we reduced use methane emissions by more than 445 metric tons and executed on our best year ever for main replacement. This stand to reduce methane extends beyond our system with exciting new programs, which will make a positive impact on the planet. We recently announced a plan to build and own our first renewable natural gas facility with a Michigan dairy farm, which is included in our pending gas rate case. This facility would be a regulated asset and the emissions reduction will remove the equivalent of 4,000 gasoline-fueled vehicles from the road annually. Clearly, we are on our way to a safe and clean gas system. Finally, I want to talk a little bit about Michigan, our home state, our service territory. In both our gas and electric business, we are seeing new service connections up over 2020 and 2019 above pre-pandemic levels. In fact, we have not seen this level of new electric service connections in the last 10 years. We also attracted 105 megawatts of new industrial loads to our service territory, which brings with it 4,000 new jobs and more than $1 billion of investment. And we are expecting even more new load growth in the state. The work we did at the end of the year on two important growth mechanisms further enhances, Michigan's competitive position.  We filed an economic development rate in November, which was quickly approved by the Michigan Public Service Commission in December. We also work closely with the legislature, business groups and the Governor's office on a package of economic development incentive bill that passed with bipartisan support signed by our Governor in December. With these improvements, I expect further announcements this year on several new projects. For you, our investors, I'm pleased to share we delivered our financial targets with another year of 7% adjusted EPS growth. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, $55 million of cost savings were realized in 2021. When I step back and reflect on 2021, it is this strong execution and results that you and we expect, and it meets our commitment to the triple bottom line, positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. Strong execution leads to strong results and 2021 marks another year of premium growth. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 in 2021 at the high end of our guidance range and up 7% from 2020. And in January, the Board approved an annual dividend increase to $1.84 per share. In addition to raising our annual dividend in 2022, I'm pleased to share that we are raising our 2022 adjusted full-year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 from $2.85 to $2.87 per share. I am confident in our plan for 2022 and our long-standing ability to manage the work and deliver industry-leading growth. Longer-term, we remain committed to growing adjusted EPS on the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share that we have rolled forward our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by over $1 billion to $14.3 billion through 2026. On Slide 5, we've highlighted our new five-year $14.3 billion customer investment plan. This translates 7% annual rate base growth and supports the two key focus areas of our strategy, making our electric and gas systems safer and more reliable and paving the way with clean energy future with Net Zero carbon and methane emissions. You will note that about 40% of our investment mix is aimed at renewable generation, grid modernization and main and service replacement on our gas system that support the clean energy transformation. Furthermore, we continue to increase our investments in what our customers count on us for every single day, safe and reliable electric and natural gas systems. You will also see that we continue to plan conservatively and have ample upside in projects not factored in this plan, such as our IRP and Voluntary Green Pricing program. We remain focused on the regulatory process as we make investment on behalf of our customers. In December, we received an order in our electric rate case. It offered several opportunities for us to improve our case process, and we are hard at work as we prepare our next phase.  This order did support our plan by maintaining our existing 9.9% ROE, increasing our regulatory equity ratio by 34 basis points and approving $54 million in revenue requirement exclusive of $27 million of lower depreciation approved prior to the order. We expect to file our next electric rate case early this year and anticipate an initial order in our IRP in April, and a final order in our gas rate case is expected by October. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has withstood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we have achieved another year of strong performance in 2021, executing on our commitment with triple bottom line and are pleased with our strong results. I'm confident we're in a great position to continue our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. We look forward to updating you as we head into another exciting year. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Good morning. Yes, great question, Shar. And let me offer this just real clarity and offer a little bit of context. And so we're pleased with 2021 and delivering the high end of guidance. And as I shared previously, we've got a lot of momentum coming into 2022, and our raise in guidance should offer much confidence to the investment community on our strength here in 2022 and our confidence in the delivery in 2022. I'll remind you that our 6% to 8%, again, towards the high end of that range, that's off a 2022 base. So that's our projection going forward. We plan conservatively. And so again, you see a lot of upside in that capital plan, the IRP, the VGP type work.  And so again, we'll weave those in as those materialize, we don't want to presume excess in those. That's why we are playing conservatively. But again, we expect to be the high end of that 2022 base. And so that's the nature of our growth pattern going forward. And I don't know, Rejji, do you want to offer some additional comments there as well? Good morning. How are you Jeremy? I assume you're talking about the incremental items and just to clarify your question? Certainly. So as you know, we're in the midst of an integrated resource plan, and we don't want to presume, although we're confident in that plan. We don't want to presume the Covert facility and the big facility will move into the utility there's certainly a lot of pretty good indicators around that. But nonetheless, we want to make sure that that's where it lands. And we'll see a final order in the IRP by June of this year. And so again, assuming success there, we would anticipate the Covert facility in 2023 and then the DIG facilities out in 2025 from an incremental opportunity. Our VGP, again, that's subscription-based, based on customers. We saw some positive traction in that, we announced this week with General Motors. But again, that construction would be \u2013 as those fill out and those are subscribed, that construction period would be in 2024 to 2027. And so that's the nature of \u2013 as that materializes, it would show up in that range. Rejji and I will take team this. Let me be very clear. I feel good about the regulatory construct here in Michigan. And when I look at this rate case, there are two things to take away from it. One, there's an investor read-through on a strong and constructive ROE, 9.9%. That has been constructive, especially when compared with other jurisdictions. It's good solid equity thickness. In fact, our regulatory equity ratio grew by 34 basis points. That just, again, speaks to the nature of this commission in this regulatory construct. And again, all based in legislation, so don't forget that piece of it as well. The other piece of opportunity is clear in the order. And as a utility, we need to improve our business cases particularly in a forward-looking test year and the additional investments we want to make on behalf of our customer. We need to do a better job of showing the benefits as well as the cost when compared to historical. That's on us. We own that and you can expect to see it in our next electric rate case. So let me hand it over to Rejji to walk through a little bit of why we have such confidence in 2022. Thanks, Insoo, and good morning. I want to be real clear with everyone here. We're at the largest electric reliability capital spend that we've had in our company's history, and it's actually 40% over 2020. So we're at a good pace in terms of electric reliability. But clearly, as we demonstrated in this electric rate case, there is more to do across our vast system. And so we'll be making requests in this upcoming electric rate case with, of course, better business justification to be able to support that. Clearly, when you look at our system and the amount of storms we had this year, there is room to \u2013 for improvement, and we're well aligned with this commission and this staff to do just that. Good morning, Michael. Yes. So I'm just going to break this down really, really clearly. I feel good about taking it a little distance. I want to make sure that's very clear. And the way I'm just \u2013 I'm sharing my thinking about this is there's $650 million of savings for our customers. That's on the table. There's a 60% reduction in carbon by 2025 over 2005 baseline levels. And there's an opportunity for more resilient supply system. Those are the factors of this. And so there's good \u2013 there's a win \u2013 I've said this before, there's a win here for everyone. And so we feel very strong about taking the full length and get what we need for our customers as well as for our investors. But bottom line, whether it's an electric case, gas case or an IRP, we're going to look at an opportunity to settle. And right now, we're in a sweet spot where there's an opportunity to do that. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's an opportunity to a partial settlement or a full sentiment. And so we'll look at that and we'll work with the parties to see if something can materialize there. But just like there's an opportunity there, all those wins allow us to take the full distance as well. So I feel confident either way that we'll get what we need for our customers to plan it and for our shareholders. Is that helpful, Michael? Mike, can I just jump in on this one as well. I've been involved in large power plants and operations for 25-plus years. I don't think there's been a year in those 25 where I haven't seen projects move from year to year. Major projects in terms of outages, in terms of construction time lines differed. And so it's pretty typical in our industry to have a little give and take. And so this supply chain challenge that's in front of us will dissipate over time, I have no doubt about that. But remember this, we're retiring coal. And so you have to fill that capacity somehow. So these projects aren't going away. It's just a matter of when we plant them in what year. And so again, this is pretty typical for the work we do year after year, this give and take. And so I'm not worried, not concerned, and this too will pass. So the $1 billion equates to 1,000 megawatts of renewables. And so the way this works is customers have prescribed to that, and we have a certain number of subscriptions, we build out that. And so the 1,000 megawatt equates to the $1 billion. And so does that help, Andrew? We've got \u2013 this program started at 120 megawatts. That is fully subscribed, and we're now in the second phase of subscribing the 1,000 megawatts. It's really a bottoms-up piece. And just let me offer a little bit in the gas. Back in November of 2020, we got a large pipeline project approved through an Act 9, which is the equivalent of a certificate of necessity that is folded into this plan. And so as you might imagine, the replacing 56 miles of large transmission pipe, the project is around five \u2013 I think it's $550 million in that range. And so that's a big factor that as you build that bottoms-up approach, it shows up in the gas and in this vintage of capital in Apple five-year plan. Good morning, Julien. Yes. So let me offer a little more color on these economics. There's two pieces. We were very successful toward the end of the year and establish an economic development rate. We filed that in November. And as I said, almost record approval here with the commission and the Public Service Commission and staff, which we see as a really good indicator here in Michigan and the opportunity to encourage job growth in jobs here in Michigan. So it's an economic development rate, which is very competitive out there, and it's designed for energy-intensive customers. The next piece is we work to achieve economic set of bills that offered incentives, to make Michigan competitive. That was offered through, again, bipartisan support through the legislature signed by the Governor, that was close to $1 billion, $1.5 billion of incentives here in the state. And so GM made their big announcement, nearly $7 billion of investment in Michigan, 4,000 new jobs. That is a direct result of that work. And so we feel good by the initial valley here. But as Rejji said, there's \u2013 and I shared in my prepared remarks, there are more that are considering Michigan, and so we see a lot of upside from an industrial and jobs growth perspective and ultimately, the spillover benefits. But Rejji, I don't know if you want to add any additional context to that at all? Well, in my earlier comments, just to be really clear, $650 million of savings in total requires the retirement of Campbell one, two and three. And start of my career at that plant, you can't do a partial there. It just doesn't work. And so you need the whole thing. One, for the savings piece for our customers, but you can't do a partial retirement. So that's critically important in this equation in this IRP. The second piece is, when you retire a plant like that, you need to backfill in terms of capacity, in terms of energy. And the lowest cost option on that, we proved their modeling is to Covert and through the DIG facilities. And so again, this is why it all comes together quite nicely. And so it's very clear what's necessary to do this type of savings for our customers, to improve the supply side from a resiliency perspective and then also to have a 60% reduction in carbon. So that's how we're approaching it. Again, a lot of benefits, a lot of wins for every one, and we think we can achieve that \u2013 not that I think. We know we can achieve that here in 2022. Yes. We need Campbell. We need all of Campbell to retire. And again, that's not built into our plans. Now our five-year plan at all, not the savings, not the capital upside. It's not in the plan. So just to be clear there. Thanks, Julien. Good morning. I don't agree with that conclusion that they're taking a slower approach. The language is really clear in the ex parte order and in electric rate case, other support for green energy. And in fact, that washing project, and it's clear that it's been supported and from a construction standpoint and a regulatory recovery standpoint. Now Rejji will walk through a little bit of the financial piece and how we'll progress with that project here over the course of 2022 and 2023. Good morning, Jonathan. Yes, specifically for new growth, both electric connections and we have a deferral mechanism on there. And so we can allocate the appropriate amount of capital for growth. And then see recovery in a subsequent case. And so that's \u2013 perhaps we have had at least the last couple of rate cases that allow us to \u2013 it's in three areas, both in new business at the relocations and demand capital. And so that's been very helpful in allowing us to expand our electric capital in year as a result of changes in the environment like great business growth. And so that's an important piece. The other piece that I would just, again, point back to, our electric reliability spend is robust. It's the largest we've had here across our company, 40% over 2020. But I would offer this, there's better and more important work we need to do in this next electric rate case. We have more capital that we want to invest on behalf of our customers and electric reliability to offer benefits and improve our performance there. and we'll work to engage that into the \u2013 to build that out in the next case. And I know Rejji would offer \u2013 also offer some comments as well. Hi, Travis. Our electric \u2013 we're going to file our electric rate case here in April timeframe. And so that's our plan right now. And so we don't anticipate \u2013 initial order could come out very earliest in April and then a final order in June. And so I don't anticipate that'll be woven into this electric rate case. Our intent here is to, so again, I don't want to presume approval. I think that would be, I don't get in front of the commission on that. But again, confidence in of a final order by June, and let's play this out Covert dig into the utility. We'd looked to update our plans, our five-year plans and the kind of the normal cycle to reflect those changes. Enterprises continues to be an important part of our business, although it was really a small part of our business. And just as a reminder for everyone on the call, it's about 4% of our earnings mix. So again, small and then as big in other facilities move into the utility that enterprise group grows as even smaller. Right now, it's focused on renewables and customer relationships. And so let me offer a little bit more context around that. For example, a company like General Motors or one of the companies that Enterprise works with. They have long-term commitment to sustainability across their global footprint. And so they provide a creditworthy party and we have a long contract period. We help them find renewable assets throughout the U.S. And so that's the role we play. We see utility-like returns or better in that space. And again, we're not out in the auctions. We're not out being squeezed from a margin perspective. It's specifically designed at customer relationships and helping them meet their sustainability targets. And so it's narrow, it's thoughtful. It's a small part of our business but important for our strategic customers. Thank you. Well, here's the good news, Anthony. You said 185 to 189, it's 285. No problem. So again, we're happy with where we landed this year, and we've got a lot of momentum coming into the year. And for some of the reasons that Rejji articulated earlier, but you may want to jump in again on this one. But bottom line, we've offered guidance there. We feel we've expanded and raised that guidance and feel good about \u2013 really good and confident about landing there. And as I shared earlier, likely in the midpoint range, a lot of year left, but in the midpoint of that range we offer today. And so again \u2013 and then after this and really into 2022, that is the base here, we'll grow at that 6% to 8% towards the high side. Anything else to offer on that Rejji? It's going well, Paul. Thanks. I don't want to minimize COVID or the health effects to people. And so probably sensitive to my response here. But bottom line, what we've \u2013 in Michigan here, we're seeing all the economic indicators are headed in the right direction. And then people have figured out a way to be able to work and live and even play in the midst of a pandemic. And as a company, we found ways to work safely with the appropriate precautions in place. And so again, we're not seeing what we saw at the beginning of the pandemic, which was economic shutdowns and other factors influencing load. It's really on the upswing. And all economic indicators are, again, headed in the right direction. And so I would put it in more of a perspective that we figured out how to work within the context of COVID. Thank you, Rocco, and I want to thank everyone for joining us today for our fourth quartile earnings call. Take care and stay safe."

Good morning everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team, both operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, co-workers, and for you, our investors. Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies in focuses our business models squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility and important step as we continue to lead the clean energy transformation. The proceeds from this sale with one key initiative in our utility business related to safety, reliability, resiliency, and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity needs from 2022 through 2024. Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks, how we have continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The key word there continued. As we double down on the clean energy transformation. I am also pleased to share that we received approval for our voluntary green pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation for our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand in currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for an important step in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers. As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible in detailed capital plans outlined in our recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a five-year view of the projects down to the circuit level, where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our electric infrastructure and align with our operational and financial plans. As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability, our prices remain competitive, as the average residential customer pays about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on. And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle. Our team has mobilized resources at the state and federal levels to ensure their protection. In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90 day arrears are back to pre-pandemic levels with an 80% reduction in our uncollectable accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first nine months of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The CE Way is in our DNA and we continue to deliver savings in the near-term and well into the future. Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with Power My Fleet. This is part of our long-term planning and collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments, and school systems, looking to electrify their vehicle fleet. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20 different customers on their fleet and have another 50 who have indicated interest the next launch, exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth. And finally, one of my favorites, which speaks to our culture, our coworkers, and our ability to attract the best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide. And most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the number one utility in the U.S. for both America's best employers for women and number one for diversity. Delivering excellence every day continues to position the business for sustainable long-term growth, strong execution leads to strong results. The two are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established an incident command structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our co-workers responded to the call. During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers. Like we do every year, the storms, pandemics, and unseasonal weather, we continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest, this is the CMS model of responding to changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year-after-year. Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing operations. Our strong performance coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the financial flexibility that provides, gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance, which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. In our continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond. That's what you expect while you own us. And we know it's a big part of our value. As we move forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business, and more importantly, our customers. Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage fields in the U.S. and compression resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas into our storage fields in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low. Right now our fields are full and we ready to deliver for our customers heating needs throughout the winter months. Most of the gas has already locked in at just under $3 per 1000 cubic feet, which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage, as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option, and we don\u2019t leave it up to the market. We buy, store and deliver. That\u2019s what we do. Michigan strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation, designed to ensure timely recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan\u2019s forward looking test years and three-year pre-approvals structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. Here\u2019s what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders. It ensures supply reliability, it reduces costs and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It\u2019s clean. We continue to have constructive dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders and we anticipate seeing their positions later today. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick and good morning everyone. I\u2019m pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief reminder, throughout our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Now onto the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses attributable to the Argus storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our electric business and higher rate relief net of investment related expenses. Year-to-date we\u2019ve delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19 per share versus the first nine months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank\u2019s financial performance. All in, we continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. For the first nine months of the year rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs of utility. This upside has been partially offset by the aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2020. To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first nine months of the year, which in addition to the August storm activity added $0.35 per share of negative variance versus a comparable period in 2020. As a reminder, these costs categories are shown net of costs savings realized to date, which is Garrick mentioned, have already exceeded our targets for the year with more upside to come. To close out our year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.07 per share, and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share as Garrick noted. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.06 per share of positive variance given the absence of the unfavorable weather experience in the fourth quarter of 2020. We\u2019ll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per share, and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And we\u2019ll make steady progress on our operational and customer related initiatives, which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. Lastly, we\u2019ll assume the usual conservatism in our utility, non-weather sales assumptions and our non-utility segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 9. I\u2019m pleased to highlight that this year\u2019s financing plan has been completed ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%. One of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax exempt revenue bonds, ahead of this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026. Due to the strong execution implied by these records setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale, which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing. We now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year, even further, which will now be limited to the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It\u2019s grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders, enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ve executed on our commitment to the triple bottom line in the first nine months of the year. We\u2019re pleased to have delivered strong results. We\u2019re positioned well to continue that momentum into the last three months of the year. As we move pass the sale of the bank and continued progress to IRP process. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] And today\u2019s first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nConstantine Lednev: Hi. Good morning, team. It\u2019s actually Constantine here for Shar. Congrats on a challenging but successful quarter.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Constantine.\nConstantine Lednev: I have a quick question on the cadence of long-term growth that you reiterated today. So the 2022 guidance implies the top of the range performance, as you mentioned, and kind of you expect to execute at the high-end. And one of the opportunities, obviously the IRP, but that may take some time for approval of execution. Just the 8% growth implies some incremental CapEx for the prior plan or any kind of financing items. And is there any change with a glide path or timing for the offset of kind of the near-term dilution from the business optimizations?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, let me tag team this with Rejji. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ll offer and here\u2019s what you should hear from this call. High confidence in 2021 and that momentum carries into 2022. And we reaffirmed our guidance for that time period the $2.85 to $2.87. And as we said in previous calls, when I look out at 20 \u2013 office 2022 base, it continues to be at this growth rate of 6% to 8%. And I would expect us to be toward the high end of that. Now, we plan conservatively and in Q4 we\u2019ll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital plan to grow with the things you would be familiar with the gas system, the electric system and the supply system. However, the IRP and particularly the Covert plant in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025 are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on and that IRP process and those provide the opportunity for upside to the plan. And so, I mean, that\u2019s the \u2013 there\u2019s a great deal of confidence that I have about this five-year window, I\u2019m going to look at from 2021 through 2025. But certainly, Rejji jump in to add some additional context.\nRejji Hayes: Well, Garrick, I think you laid it out well. And Constantine, the only thing I would add just to give you a bit more specifics around the numbers. So our current plan that we\u2019re executing on for five years or 2021 through 2025 is about $13.2 billion. We have not changed that, but we are assuming that we\u2019ll increase that by about $1 billion next year in the next vintage into Garrick\u2019s comments that does not presuppose any outcome for the IRP. And there\u2019s about $1.3 billion of additional capital investment opportunities that is on the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan. We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there\u2019s a funding efficiency that will also be accretive to our financial performance as we see it. And what\u2019s also not in a plan from a capital investment perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks was a voluntary green pricing program that we got approval on, which offers about 1 gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable spend that we would own from 2024 through 2027. And so all of that\u2019s on the outside looking in, so you can see why we have great confidence in our ability to deliver towards that high end off of the 2022 base.\nConstantine Lednev: Perfect. I think that\u2019s very comprehensive. And maybe just shifting to the regulatory process for bid. Just on the IRP, can you talk about how you\u2019re building kind of some of the stakeholder comfort with the kind of asset retirement and reg asset treatment and the kind of the mechanisms that you\u2019re proposing? Does any of the thinking changed around the generation portfolio in light of the commodity shifts that we have seen?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I\u2019ll offer this one. Just credit to the team here at Consumers Energy and CMS Energy. There\u2019s been an extensive stakeholder process and engagement with staff, with interveners, with the public that\u2019s led up to the filing and has continued through the filing process. And so I feel really confident about that. The messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes. But in my prepared remarks, I said, there\u2019s a win in this for everyone. And I really believe that. When you look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of our electric supply, we\u2019ve done the modeling. It\u2019s more reliable plan in the past. It\u2019s more affordable, $650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, well ahead of the Paris Accord, the equivalent of taking 12.5 cars off the road. And from my stage point \u2013 standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment, as I shared in the Q2 call, great testimony, and I think we\u2019re going to have a constructive dialogue, and certainly a supportive dialogue we\u2019ll see this afternoon in the intervener comments. And so there is a win in here for everyone. And when there\u2019s a win in there for everyone, there\u2019s a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I\u2019m looking forward to seeing staff and interveners testimony this afternoon, it\u2019s going to be supportive. It will be balanced, it\u2019ll be constructive. And were there differences? We\u2019ve done that before, just looking at our 2018, 2019 IRP. I feel good about where we\u2019re at in the process.\nConstantine Lednev: Perfect. Thank you. That\u2019s very comprehensive. Then I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Congrats.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi. Good morning. Just want to pick up on the CapEx side here and just wanted to see how you thinking about going to hardening investments at this point? And specifically, do you think in reaction to the storms this summer, we could kind of see more movement on this side?\nGarrick Rochow: Let me offer this. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we had a great response during the storm and I\u2019ll be really clear. The fact pattern of storms has been different across the state. We\u2019ve had one major storm. But if you stand back and look at the big picture and look forward from a strategy perspective, there certainly is a call for greater resiliency and grid hardening. And that\u2019s an opportunity, opportunity from an investment perspective and an opportunity to create greater value for our customers. And so I think there\u2019s a couple of thing driving that. One, we\u2019re seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to support those vehicles, not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that, but also we want to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service, today it\u2019s just the refrigerator, tomorrow it\u2019s the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That\u2019s a whole new standard of performance. And so again, big picture perspective looking at for the future, I see this as an opportunity and inflection point where we spend more time and thinking about resiliency and grid hardening. I\u2019ll share one last point on this. I\u2019ve had the opportunity post-storm to talk with the governor to talk with the chair scripts and I can\u2019t speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talk about how do we design the grid for the future, with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again, it\u2019s an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that. And maybe just thinking about load as we exit the pandemic here. Just wondering if you could provide thoughts, I guess, as far as trends by class and really on the residential side, how you\u2019re seeing, I guess, stickiness there and just any thoughts that you could share on that side?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I can offer some color there. And we do have a slide in our appendix of the presentation, which is helpful, Slide 13 I\u2019ll point you to also the detailed 15 Page Digest, also some good content on load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continued to be encouraged by the residential weather normalized load we\u2019re seeing. So, you probably saw a year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our budget, we had much more bearish expectations. This year we actually thought there\u2019d be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%, that\u2019s an excess of plan and so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the pre-pandemic level and relative to 2019, we\u2019re up about 2.5%. And so we do think there\u2019s a very nice bit of resiliency to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you know.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Insoo Kim at Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. It\u2019s Rebecca on for Insoo. Thanks for taking our questions. So for the ALJ decision on your rate case, it was roughly 25% of your requested revenue increase. So can you describe which items constitute the difference? And then if this gets adopted, would this impact your 2022 and 2023 growth trajectory?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I\u2019ll offer this. I really view this PFD from the ALJ as a bookend. And Michigan\u2019s constructive regulatory environment and this commission and previous commissions have really shown a balanced and constructive approach. And I can\u2019t speak for the commissioners, but my interaction with the commissioners would suggest this, that they believe and support healthy utilities, good outcomes from electric and gas rate cases. And when you have those and similar goals, it leads to good outcomes. And so I view we\u2019re going to get an outcome in this electric order that\u2019s in December, that\u2019s both constructive and balanced, good for Michigan\u2019s residents, Michigan \u2013 our customers, and frankly, good for CMS Energy. But Rejji if you want to just jump into some of the differences.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Rebecca, thanks for the question. So what I would add there is you do have a few sources, or I\u2019ll say buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up. And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for 10.5% ROE, the ALJ was at 9.7%. And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also you see a difference in equity thickness. And so we were at 52% equity relative to debt and the PFD was about a point lower than that I call it 51% and change. And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think, if memory serves me, there was about $0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I\u2019d say those are the major buckets there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten that gap, but it\u2019s primarily those buckets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks. And then for the EDIP, how much of that is in your five-year base plan and would that be incremental to your rate base or earnings growth?\nRejji Hayes: I\u2019m sorry. I missed the first part you said for your what?\nUnidentified Analyst: EDIP filing in your five-year base plan.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So the $4 billion that does a lot of capital to be clear, the $4 billion of capital attributable to the EDIP and further we announced that there is the electric distribution infrastructure investment plan that does align. With the spend rate we\u2019ve been on for some time, and so in our current five-year capital plan of $13.2 billion, about $5.5 billion of that is attributable to electric distribution. And so we\u2019re on this sort of run rate of over $1 billion a year \u2013 $1 billion per year of capital investment. And we think that\u2019s appropriate to balance resilience, reliability, as well as affordability. And so that\u2019s effectively what this EDIP propose is.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thanks so much.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Hey, good morning, guys.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nJonathan Arnold: Can you just Rejji you mentioned on the roll forward of the capital clan, you would do probably \u2013 probably about $1 billion associated with that. Could you just \u2013 is that the voluntary green pricing being rolled in? Is it something else? Would the VGP be incremental may a little more color on that comment?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Sure, Jonathan. So to be clear the $1 billion that we\u2019ll likely add to our next five-year plan from 2022 to 2026, that does not include the VGP and the opportunity there for that gigawatt of renewables, nor does it include any of the potential capital investment opportunity associated with the IRP. What it will likely entail is as you may recall, we had when we rolled out our ten-year plan and say the back half of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 million to $4 billion of upside capital investment opportunities, which were not part of that 10 year $25 billion plan. And it largely had to do with electric and gas infrastructure modernization. And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent that call it roughly $1 billion of upside. I also think we\u2019re going to obviously roll forward our IRP related solar investments that are part of just the existing IRP that we\u2019re executing on. So you\u2019ll probably see some of that come into the plan as well as we add another year to our five-year rolling CapEx plan. Is that helpful.\nJonathan Arnold: Yes, very helpful, Rejji. So said another way that $3 billion to $4 billion is still there, despite the VGP and the IRP.\nRejji Hayes: That\u2019s exactly right.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. And then can I just push, you mentioned that the VGP is already oversubscribed. Give us any flavor of sort of by how much, and what\u2019s the pathway to potentially expanding that?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I\u2019d offer this one. Some of those are non-disclosure agreements, but just some public announcements, on Earth Day of this year, I was with the governor and we were announced that we were supporting the state facilities and they\u2019re moved to renewable energy. So that\u2019s an example. I\u2019ll share with you that I was with a large customer just yesterday the global company, and they were looking at their large manufacturing facilities here in Michigan and looking at renewable type options. And so we're seeing a definite directional \u2013 direction in terms of sustainability among our large industrial customers, and this serves their needs. And so I'm not going to get into how much or from an oversubscription standpoint, but hopefully those examples provide some color on the context of opportunity there.\nRejji Hayes: And Jonathan, the only thing I would add is if the spirit of your question is whether there will be sufficient demand for that gigawatt of opportunity, that we certainly feel very competent that there'll be requisite demand to meet the gigawatt of opportunity for the voluntary program.\nJonathan Arnold: The question was a bit more if you're oversubscribed, how are you \u2013 you need to add to it in order to keep \u2013 having those conversations.\nGarrick Rochow: And as we see it, that's what the voluntary green program would offer up about a gigawatt of additional capacity that we would own in the form of most likely solar new builds.\nRejji Hayes: So at this point, I mean to answer your question, Jonathan, and at this point, we don't need to add to it. There's some runway there and we'd look to construct these renewable assets in the 24 to 27 timeline. So it's oversubscribed from what we have right now, and this will make up a good portion of that 1,000 megawatts, but there's more room to grow over there.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm sorry to put you on the spot a little bit here, but just seeing some of these filing start to come in on the IRP looks like some of the environmental parties pushing back on the gas plant additions, I guess, is that surprising to you guys at all? And ways to kind of come to some sort of agreement with them path forward. Any thoughts there?\nGarrick Rochow: I would offer this, when I say there's a wind in there forever one. It's clear that the environmental community loves the fact that we're eliminating coal and would like natural gas not to be the substitute, but here's what we know that the only way that you can deliver the resiliency and the supply side of the business and make sure we don't have an interruption in service, like was evident in Texas is to have natural gas as part of the solution. And so like I said, the staff and the other interveners are certainly mindful of the resiliency and the importance of natural gas within the state. So there's a lot of give and take within these. And I would just offer this in 2018. And in 2019 we had a lot of different points of view from an intervener perspective and we settled that case. And so differences are expected and we worked through those just like we have done and we have a track record of doing that.\nMichael Sullivan: Makes sense. And just sticking with the IRP, the other key focus area, I think you touched on a little, was the regulatory asset treatment at any parties in particular, you would expect to maybe push back on that. Initially, as we start to see the testimony.\nGarrick Rochow: Again, I would offer this and you have said this on the Q2 call and in other settings, this is an integrated resource plan and it's not a buffet. We've put together a great plan for Michigan. There was a winning in it for everyone. And so, we've been really clear about the need for recovery of, and on the asset. And so going forward, I mean, that's part of the plan and we've got testimony to support that. And as I stated earlier, when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a path to a good order and a good outcome. And so where there is differences, we have shown \u2013 we have the ability to work with everyone. And so again, I just see a nice positive outcome here in next year in 2022.\nMichael Sullivan: Great, thanks. Thanks a lot, Garrick.\nOperator: Next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate the opportunity to connect. So just in brief, if we can talk about the supportive commentary you brought up a moment ago around the testimony here, can you elaborate a little bit of specifically what your expectations are this afternoon and perhaps more specifically as you stated supportive, I imagine that you see across latitude towards the settlement here. I just want to make sure I'm acquainting one towards the other, right. I mean in terms of what this translates to next in terms of order,\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I would offer this. I mean, I don't have a visibility into the testimony until it's published. And so, I mean, obviously we had a great discussion with number of the interveners. We know some of their points of view where there might be good support and where there might be small differences. And so again, I would reflect on it this way. Again, we've done this in the past many times and rate cases and the like, and we've certainly done this with an IRP where there's differences. We find a way to work through those. And again, I think this afternoon, we're going to see, and I look forward to reading it. I think we're going to see supportive comments in general. And so when, again, when there's a winning in there for everyone, there's a path to a successful outcome. Now, I don't know if it's going to go down the path of settlement or we'll take it to the full order. But again, when there's a win there, there's an opportunity for success and that's what I'm confident about.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. All right. And then just coming back to the rate case a little bit here, given the discrepancy between the ALJ and the staff, does that inform your strategy heading into your next filing here in Q1 at all? I mean, obviously there's some specific deltas there that you alluded to a moment ago, Rejji, but can you, can you elaborate a little bit more and maybe how you move forward, especially in the next cases, if there's anything yet?\nGarrick Rochow: This is a constructive regulatory environment. Julien, you know that, I know that and I really see this PFD as a bookend, as I stated earlier. And so the conversations that we have with staff in outside of cases is really how do we continue to ensure a safe and reliable natural gas system? How do we ensure and bring clean energy to Michigan? How do we ensure the reliability and resiliency in electric grid? And so those are in line with our goals and what we want to do as well. And so, we'll continue to be thoughtful about that process to make sure we balance customer's affordability with that. But I don't see any real change in plans as a result of a specific ALJ, PFD at all.\nRejji Hayes: And Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, at the end of the day, it also speaks to just the benefit of the Michigan regulatory construct and the legislation in that. Any event there is misalignment because ultimately at the end of the day, the commission's order will dictate where we end up. But in the event, there is a misalignment, there's a forward-looking test here. And so obviously we have not incurred the expenses on the capital or the O&M side. And so if we see misalignment in terms of where we'd like to go versus where the commission ends up, where we can toggle the capital and spend program accordingly. So again, it just speaks to the constructive nature, not just of decisions we've seen in the past, but also the rate construct and the legislation itself.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, I hear you bookend is the keyword here, actually, guys, best of luck. We'll speak soon.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Julien. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Travis Miller at Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: I have two questions going back to the storms. First one is in your discussions that you referenced with regulators, governor either within or outside of the rate cases, there've been any talk in addition to some of the public comments about fines or penalties or other kinds of pushback on the storm response. That's my first question. And then the second question was the 16 funds. Can you kind of break that down in terms of how you offset that to stay on track with the guidance and for this year?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, two part, this one between Rejji , take the second question and I'll take the first piece. I would offer this, one again, conversation with the governor's office in which chair scripts have been constructive. And again, I don't want to speak for the chair, but I would offer this, the commission has been supportive of both our electric reliability spend as of recent the capital investments, as well as increased forestry spend. We increased our forestry spend this year by little over 60%, and that was supported through a rate case process by the commission and the commissioners understand that we're in the first year, that the number one cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive program now in place, which will benefit our customers. And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers. And so I think there's full recognition of that. I have not heard any talk at all, zero from the governor's office or from the commission on any sort of penalties associated with the storms in August.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great.\nRejji Hayes: And Travis, the only thing I would add is with respect to the $0.16 of negative variance that I noted my prepared remarks for Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year, it was in large part offset as a result of just good weather we saw throughout quarter, it was quite warm the month of August and that offset a lot of the incremental service restoration costs that were incurred. And I also want to give credit \u2013 where credit is due. I think the fact that we've already exceeded our expectations on cost savings across the organization was also quite helpful in offsetting some of the service restoration. And then lastly, again, as I mentioned, residential down 2% year-to-date, roughly versus year-to-date last year, but it's ahead of plan two. And so you've got a little favorable mix as well versus plan. So all of those factors have largely offset the service restoration expense that we saw in Q3.\nTravis Miller: Yes. Thanks. And then just a quick clarification on the $0.16 that was incremental to plan, or did that include typical storm related expenses? I assume you include\u2026\nRejji Hayes: Yes, the $0.16 was incremental to Q3 of 2020. So it's just \u2013 that's a historical comp and that's what that estimate is predicated on versus plant, a little higher than planned. But remember, in addition to having a decent amount of service restoration in our budget, we also utilize some regulatory mechanisms both what we call a voluntary refund mechanism that we put in place at the end of 2020 that provided additional budgetary support. And then we also shared a gain on the sale of some assets related to our transmission assets in 2020, but offered additional I\u2019d say regulatory liabilities to support that provide additional budgetary installation of the service restoration this year.\nTravis Miller: Okay, great. Thanks so much, appreciate the details.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ryan Levine with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. So one on financing proposal, in your plan it looks you reduced your equity needs for this year by about $43 million. Can you walk us through what\u2019s the driver of that and how much is really contributed to the purchase price adjustment for the recent asset sale and if there is any other factors that are driving that number if there is some conservatism baked to that?\nGarrick Rochow: Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. So the EnerBank sale gross proceeds and the upside associated there was the key driver that enabled us to reduce our equity financing needs the year and the way it works. And it's a little nuanced I've been doing M&A for almost 20 years, but for Fincos or financial service companies, you have your traditional adjustments from signed to close on a working capital side, but from a financial service companies, you also get credit if the book equity of the business increases from signed to close, and we saw that with EnerBank\u2019s outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about $60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing which was $960 million, not to the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion. And so that's what gave us the upside and financial flexibility to reduce the equity needs. And so it's really a function of just that really strong performance at the bank that it created their book equity that gave us more proceeds at close.\nRyan Levine: I mean, that's a bigger number than the amount of equity you reduced. Is there some conservative baked into your reduction in equity needs or is this effectively a few million dollars worth of pre-funding of future equity needs or future capital needs?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So remember we have about $57 million of equity forwards that we've already put in place. And we have been putting those in place even before we announced the sale of the bank. And so that gives you effectively a four for how low you're going to go, because at some point we will settle that. And so that's why we stopped at that sort of $57 million. It's because of the existing equity forwards we already have in place.\nRyan Levine: Okay, great. So I guess that helps you for future years for capital needs. Appreciate it. That's all I have.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Rocco. And I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today. We're looking forward to seeing you at EEI in the near future here and take care and stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick and good morning everyone. I'm pleased to offer the details of another strong quarter of financial performance at CMS as a result of solid execution across the company. As a brief reminder, throughout our materials, we report the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment in reporting our quarterly and year-to-date results from continuing operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Now onto the results. For the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $156 million or $0.54 per share. The key drivers for the quarter were higher service restoration expenses attributable to the Argus storms that Garrick mentioned and planned increases in other operating and maintenance expenses in support of key customer and operational initiatives. These sources of negative variance for the quarter were partially offset by favorable weather, the continued recovery of commercial and industrial sales in our electric business and higher rate relief net of investment related expenses. Year-to-date we've delivered adjusted net income of $628 million or $2.18 per share, which is up $0.19 per share versus the first nine months of 2020, exclusive of EnerBank's financial performance. All in, we continue to trend ahead of plan and have substantial financial flexibility heading into the fourth quarter. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more detail on key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. For the first nine months of the year rate relief continues to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.45 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment related costs such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs of utility. This upside has been partially offset by the aforementioned storms in the quarter, which drove $0.16 per share of negative variance versus the third quarter of 2020 and $0.11 per share of downside on a year-to-date basis versus the comparable period in 2020. To round out the customer initiatives bucket, planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund safety, reliability and decarbonization initiatives added the balance of spend for the first nine months of the year, which in addition to the August storm activity added $0.35 per share of negative variance versus a comparable period in 2020. As a reminder, these costs categories are shown net of costs savings realized to date, which is Garrick mentioned, have already exceeded our targets for the year with more upside to come. To close out our year-to-date performance, we also benefited from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.07 per share, and another $0.02 per share of upside, largely driven by recovering commercial and industrial load. As we look ahead to the remainder of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path for delivering on our EPS guidance range, which has been revised upward to $2.63 to $2.65 per share as Garrick noted. As we look ahead, we continue to plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.06 per share of positive variance given the absence of the unfavorable weather experience in the fourth quarter of 2020. We'll also continue to benefit from the residual impact of our 2020 rate orders, which equates to $0.07 per share, and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And we'll make steady progress on our operational and customer related initiatives, which are forecasted to have a financial impact of roughly $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020. Lastly, we'll assume the usual conservatism in our utility, non-weather sales assumptions and our non-utility segment performance. All in, we are pleased with our strong execution to date in 2021 and are well positioned for the remainder of the year. Turning to Slide 9. I'm pleased to highlight that this year's financing plan has been completed ahead of schedule. In the third quarter, we issued $300 million of first mortgage bonds at a coupon rate of 2.65%. One of the lowest rates ever achieved at Consumers Energy. We also remarketed $35 million of tax exempt revenue bonds, ahead of this month at a rate of under 1% through 2026. Due to the strong execution implied by these records setting issuances coupled with the EnerBank sale, which provided approximately $60 million of upside relative to the sale price announced at signing. We now have the flexibility to reduce our equity needs for the year, even further, which will now be limited to the $57 million of equity forwards we have already contracted. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A. Well, Garrick, I think you laid it out well. And Constantine, the only thing I would add just to give you a bit more specifics around the numbers. So our current plan that we're executing on for five years or 2021 through 2025 is about $13.2 billion. We have not changed that, but we are assuming that we'll increase that by about $1 billion next year in the next vintage into Garrick's comments that does not presuppose any outcome for the IRP. And there's about $1.3 billion of additional capital investment opportunities that is on the outside looking in, which just gives us more confidence in the plan. We also are not planning to issue equity. And so there's a funding efficiency that will also be accretive to our financial performance as we see it. And what's also not in a plan from a capital investment perspective that Garrick offered in his prepared remarks was a voluntary green pricing program that we got approval on, which offers about 1 gigawatt of capital investment opportunities, specifically renewable spend that we would own from 2024 through 2027. And so all of that's on the outside looking in, so you can see why we have great confidence in our ability to deliver towards that high end off of the 2022 base. Yes. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I can offer some color there. And we do have a slide in our appendix of the presentation, which is helpful, Slide 13 I'll point you to also the detailed 15 Page Digest, also some good content on load. But what I can say at a very high level is we continued to be encouraged by the residential weather normalized load we're seeing. So, you probably saw a year-to-date down roughly 2%, but that certainly compares favorable to plan where we assumed a more aggressive return to facilities for workers. And so we do think that this sort of hybrid format or mass teleworking trend should carry on and potentially be part of a new normal. And so in our budget, we had much more bearish expectations. This year we actually thought there'd be a quicker recovery and you see this down 2%, that's an excess of plan and so we see performance to the upside there. And then we also compare it to the pre-pandemic level and relative to 2019, we're up about 2.5%. And so we do think there's a very nice bit of resiliency to the residential load. And again, it offers a higher margin relative to the other customer classes as you know. Thank you. Yes. Rebecca, thanks for the question. So what I would add there is you do have a few sources, or I'll say buckets of variants that lead to that delta between what we requested and where the PFD ended up. And so I would say cost of capital is a component. So we asked for 10.5% ROE, the ALJ was at 9.7%. And so that makes up a good portion of the difference. Also you see a difference in equity thickness. And so we were at 52% equity relative to debt and the PFD was about a point lower than that I call it 51% and change. And so those are the primary sources of difference. There also were differences in opinion on the capital required to really strengthen and harden the system. And so I think, if memory serves me, there was about $0.25 billion of capital investments that we were proposing for resiliency and reliability, which obviously we think is critically important, particularly on the heels of the August storm activity we saw. And we saw that also as a recommended disallowance of future spend. And so I'd say those are the major buckets there. And I think once you normalize for the prevailing ROE and equity thickness, you start to tighten that gap, but it's primarily those buckets. I'm sorry. I missed the first part you said for your what? Yes. So the $4 billion that does a lot of capital to be clear, the $4 billion of capital attributable to the EDIP and further we announced that there is the electric distribution infrastructure investment plan that does align. With the spend rate we've been on for some time, and so in our current five-year capital plan of $13.2 billion, about $5.5 billion of that is attributable to electric distribution. And so we're on this sort of run rate of over $1 billion a year \u2013 $1 billion per year of capital investment. And we think that's appropriate to balance resilience, reliability, as well as affordability. And so that's effectively what this EDIP propose is. Thank you. Yes. Sure, Jonathan. So to be clear the $1 billion that we'll likely add to our next five-year plan from 2022 to 2026, that does not include the VGP and the opportunity there for that gigawatt of renewables, nor does it include any of the potential capital investment opportunity associated with the IRP. What it will likely entail is as you may recall, we had when we rolled out our ten-year plan and say the back half of 2019, if memory serves me, we said we had about $3 million to $4 billion of upside capital investment opportunities, which were not part of that 10 year $25 billion plan. And it largely had to do with electric and gas infrastructure modernization. And so those will be the likely components that are added to the capital plan going forward and represent that call it roughly $1 billion of upside. I also think we're going to obviously roll forward our IRP related solar investments that are part of just the existing IRP that we're executing on. So you'll probably see some of that come into the plan as well as we add another year to our five-year rolling CapEx plan. Is that helpful. That's exactly right. And Jonathan, the only thing I would add is if the spirit of your question is whether there will be sufficient demand for that gigawatt of opportunity, that we certainly feel very competent that there'll be requisite demand to meet the gigawatt of opportunity for the voluntary program. So at this point, I mean to answer your question, Jonathan, and at this point, we don't need to add to it. There's some runway there and we'd look to construct these renewable assets in the 24 to 27 timeline. So it's oversubscribed from what we have right now, and this will make up a good portion of that 1,000 megawatts, but there's more room to grow over there. And Julien, this is Rejji. The only thing I would add is, at the end of the day, it also speaks to just the benefit of the Michigan regulatory construct and the legislation in that. Any event there is misalignment because ultimately at the end of the day, the commission's order will dictate where we end up. But in the event, there is a misalignment, there's a forward-looking test here. And so obviously we have not incurred the expenses on the capital or the O&M side. And so if we see misalignment in terms of where we'd like to go versus where the commission ends up, where we can toggle the capital and spend program accordingly. So again, it just speaks to the constructive nature, not just of decisions we've seen in the past, but also the rate construct and the legislation itself. And Travis, the only thing I would add is with respect to the $0.16 of negative variance that I noted my prepared remarks for Q3 of this year versus Q3 of last year, it was in large part offset as a result of just good weather we saw throughout quarter, it was quite warm the month of August and that offset a lot of the incremental service restoration costs that were incurred. And I also want to give credit \u2013 where credit is due. I think the fact that we've already exceeded our expectations on cost savings across the organization was also quite helpful in offsetting some of the service restoration. And then lastly, again, as I mentioned, residential down 2% year-to-date, roughly versus year-to-date last year, but it's ahead of plan two. And so you've got a little favorable mix as well versus plan. So all of those factors have largely offset the service restoration expense that we saw in Q3. Yes, the $0.16 was incremental to Q3 of 2020. So it's just \u2013 that's a historical comp and that's what that estimate is predicated on versus plant, a little higher than planned. But remember, in addition to having a decent amount of service restoration in our budget, we also utilize some regulatory mechanisms both what we call a voluntary refund mechanism that we put in place at the end of 2020 that provided additional budgetary support. And then we also shared a gain on the sale of some assets related to our transmission assets in 2020, but offered additional I'd say regulatory liabilities to support that provide additional budgetary installation of the service restoration this year."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased to share we've delivered another strong quarter and continue to be ahead of plan for the year. I'll walk through the specifics in a moment, but I couldn't be more pleased with the strong execution demonstrated by the team, both operationally and financially. We continue to deliver every day for our customers, co-workers, and for you, our investors. Earlier this month, we completed the sale of EnerBank, grossing over $1 billion in proceeds. I want to thank the entire team that brought this to close. The sale of the bank simplifies in focuses our business models squarely on energy, primarily the regulated utility and important step as we continue to lead the clean energy transformation. The proceeds from this sale with one key initiative in our utility business related to safety, reliability, resiliency, and our clean energy transformation. As shared in previous calls, we have eliminated our equity needs from 2022 through 2024. Furthermore, Rejji will highlight in his prepared remarks, how we have continued to reduce this year's equity needs as well. The key word there continued. As we double down on the clean energy transformation. I am also pleased to share that we received approval for our voluntary green pricing program, which would add an additional 1,000 megawatts of owned renewable generation for our growing renewable portfolio. This program is in high demand in currently oversubscribed. And more importantly, it's what our customers are asking for an important step in offering renewable energy solutions for our customers. As we prepare for the grid of the future, we have a highly visible in detailed capital plans outlined in our recently filed electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. This plan provides a five-year view of the projects down to the circuit level, where we plan to invest to ensure the reliability and resiliency of our electric infrastructure and align with our operational and financial plans. As always, we balance these investments with customer affordability, our prices remain competitive, as the average residential customer pays about $2 a day to heat their home and $4 a day to keep the lights on. And because we know our most vulnerable customers still struggle. Our team has mobilized resources at the state and federal levels to ensure their protection. In fact, as we approach the winter heating season, our 90 day arrears are back to pre-pandemic levels with an 80% reduction in our uncollectable accounts. Our commitment to identifying and eliminating waste means that we keep our prices affordable. This commitment is evident in our results. In the first nine months of this year, we surpassed our full year cost reduction target of more than $40 million. The CE Way is in our DNA and we continue to deliver savings in the near-term and well into the future. Speaking of the future, this year, we grew our EV program with Power My Fleet. This is part of our long-term planning and collaboration with Michigan businesses, governments, and school systems, looking to electrify their vehicle fleet. Within just a few months of the program introduction, we were working with nearly 20 different customers on their fleet and have another 50 who have indicated interest the next launch, exceeding our expectations. This is an important contribution to our long-term sales growth. And finally, one of my favorites, which speaks to our culture, our coworkers, and our ability to attract the best talent. Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to be recognized nationwide. And most recently by Forbes, where we were ranked the number one utility in the U.S. for both America's best employers for women and number one for diversity. Delivering excellence every day continues to position the business for sustainable long-term growth, strong execution leads to strong results. The two are linked. One drives the other. In early August, we experienced one of the worst storms in our company's history. Our team established an incident command structure to deploy resources and took decisive action to restore customers. We had a record number of crews on our system. The speed of our response led to the highest positive customer sentiment we have ever received during a major storm. I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to thank all our co-workers responded to the call. During the storm, we had more than 3,700 members of our team working around the clock to safely restore customers. Like we do every year, the storms, pandemics, and unseasonal weather, we continue to deliver. And when there's upside, we reinvest, this is the CMS model of responding to changing conditions that allows us to deliver consistently year-after-year. Year-to-date, we've delivered ahead of plan with adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 for continuing operations. Our strong performance coupled with the completion of the EnerBank transaction and the financial flexibility that provides, gives us further confidence in our ability to meet our full year guidance, which we've raised to $2.63 to $2.65 from $2.61 to $2.65 for continuing operations. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. In our continued strong performance in 2021 builds momentum for 2022 and beyond. Longer term, we are committed to growing our adjusted EPS toward the high end of our 6% to 8% growth range as we highlighted on our Q2 call. As previously stated, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022 and beyond. That's what you expect while you own us. And we know it's a big part of our value. As we move forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. Many of you have asked about gas prices and the impact on our business, and more importantly, our customers. Let me tell you about our gas business. We have one of the largest storage fields in the U.S. and compression resources to match. That is a significant advantage. We started putting natural gas into our storage fields in April and continued throughout the summer when natural gas prices were low. Right now our fields are full and we ready to deliver for our customers heating needs throughout the winter months. Most of the gas has already locked in at just under $3 per 1000 cubic feet, which is well below current levels in the spot market and offers tremendous customer value. Given the operational certainty of storage, as well as the financial protection of a pass-through clause, our customers stay safe and warm all winter long and have affordable bills. Heat in Michigan is not an option, and we don't leave it up to the market. We buy, store and deliver. That's what we do. Michigan strong regulatory construct is known across the industry as one of the best. It includes the integrated resource plan process, which is a result of legislation, designed to ensure timely recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe, reliable and clean energy in our state. Michigan's forward looking test years and three-year pre-approvals structure of the IRP process gives visibility on our future growth. It enables the company and the commission to align on long-term generation supply planning and provide certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. Here's what I like about our recently filed IRP. There is a win in it for everyone. It is a remarkable plan that addresses many of the interests of our stakeholders. It ensures supply reliability, it reduces costs and it delivers industry-leading carbon emission reductions. It's clean. We continue to have constructive dialogue with the staff and other stakeholders and we anticipate seeing their positions later today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Thanks, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It's grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders, enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. As we've highlighted today, we've executed on our commitment to the triple bottom line in the first nine months of the year. We're pleased to have delivered strong results. We're positioned well to continue that momentum into the last three months of the year. As we move pass the sale of the bank and continued progress to IRP process. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Thanks, Constantine. Well, let me tag team this with Rejji. But here's what I'll offer and here's what you should hear from this call. High confidence in 2021 and that momentum carries into 2022. And we reaffirmed our guidance for that time period the $2.85 to $2.87. And as we said in previous calls, when I look out at 20 \u2013 office 2022 base, it continues to be at this growth rate of 6% to 8%. And I would expect us to be toward the high end of that. Now, we plan conservatively and in Q4 we'll provide our capital plan. We expect that capital plan to grow with the things you would be familiar with the gas system, the electric system and the supply system. However, the IRP and particularly the Covert plant in 2023 and the dig assets in 2025 are upside to that plan. And once we have complete certainty on and that IRP process and those provide the opportunity for upside to the plan. And so, I mean, that's the \u2013 there's a great deal of confidence that I have about this five-year window, I'm going to look at from 2021 through 2025. But certainly, Rejji jump in to add some additional context. Well, I'll offer this one. Just credit to the team here at Consumers Energy and CMS Energy. There's been an extensive stakeholder process and engagement with staff, with interveners, with the public that's led up to the filing and has continued through the filing process. And so I feel really confident about that. The messages and the testimony are strong and solid and will yield really good outcomes. But in my prepared remarks, I said, there's a win in this for everyone. And I really believe that. When you look at this plan, our 2018-2019 IRP was a great plan. This is even better. The resiliency and reliability of our electric supply, we've done the modeling. It's more reliable plan in the past. It's more affordable, $650 million of savings in this plan over the previous plan. And we cut carbon emissions by 60% by 2025, well ahead of the Paris Accord, the equivalent of taking 12.5 cars off the road. And from my stage point \u2013 standpoint here in the regulatory asset treatment, as I shared in the Q2 call, great testimony, and I think we're going to have a constructive dialogue, and certainly a supportive dialogue we'll see this afternoon in the intervener comments. And so there is a win in here for everyone. And when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a great path to a great outcome. And I believe that we saw that in 2018 and 2019. And so I'm looking forward to seeing staff and interveners testimony this afternoon, it's going to be supportive. It will be balanced, it'll be constructive. And were there differences? We've done that before, just looking at our 2018, 2019 IRP. I feel good about where we're at in the process. Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy. Let me offer this. As I shared in my prepared remarks, we had a great response during the storm and I'll be really clear. The fact pattern of storms has been different across the state. We've had one major storm. But if you stand back and look at the big picture and look forward from a strategy perspective, there certainly is a call for greater resiliency and grid hardening. And that's an opportunity, opportunity from an investment perspective and an opportunity to create greater value for our customers. And so I think there's a couple of thing driving that. One, we're seeing more severe weather, not just in Michigan, but across the U.S. And so that is certainly a driver in the equation. And then two, when we think about this transition to electric vehicles and be able to support those vehicles, not only do we need the capacity out there to be able to do that, but also we want to ensure that when we do have an interruption in service, today it's just the refrigerator, tomorrow it's the refrigerator and the EV and their ability to get to work. That's a whole new standard of performance. And so again, big picture perspective looking at for the future, I see this as an opportunity and inflection point where we spend more time and thinking about resiliency and grid hardening. I'll share one last point on this. I've had the opportunity post-storm to talk with the governor to talk with the chair scripts and I can't speak for them, but certainly a positive direction when we talk about how do we design the grid for the future, with climate change and with severe weather in mind. And so again, it's an opportunity for investors and an opportunity to create additional value for our customers. Well, I'll offer this. I really view this PFD from the ALJ as a bookend. And Michigan's constructive regulatory environment and this commission and previous commissions have really shown a balanced and constructive approach. And I can't speak for the commissioners, but my interaction with the commissioners would suggest this, that they believe and support healthy utilities, good outcomes from electric and gas rate cases. And when you have those and similar goals, it leads to good outcomes. And so I view we're going to get an outcome in this electric order that's in December, that's both constructive and balanced, good for Michigan's residents, Michigan \u2013 our customers, and frankly, good for CMS Energy. But Rejji if you want to just jump into some of the differences. Good morning. Well, I'd offer this one. Some of those are non-disclosure agreements, but just some public announcements, on Earth Day of this year, I was with the governor and we were announced that we were supporting the state facilities and they're moved to renewable energy. So that's an example. I'll share with you that I was with a large customer just yesterday the global company, and they were looking at their large manufacturing facilities here in Michigan and looking at renewable type options. And so we're seeing a definite directional \u2013 direction in terms of sustainability among our large industrial customers, and this serves their needs. And so I'm not going to get into how much or from an oversubscription standpoint, but hopefully those examples provide some color on the context of opportunity there. And as we see it, that's what the voluntary green program would offer up about a gigawatt of additional capacity that we would own in the form of most likely solar new builds. I would offer this, when I say there's a wind in there forever one. It's clear that the environmental community loves the fact that we're eliminating coal and would like natural gas not to be the substitute, but here's what we know that the only way that you can deliver the resiliency and the supply side of the business and make sure we don't have an interruption in service, like was evident in Texas is to have natural gas as part of the solution. And so like I said, the staff and the other interveners are certainly mindful of the resiliency and the importance of natural gas within the state. So there's a lot of give and take within these. And I would just offer this in 2018. And in 2019 we had a lot of different points of view from an intervener perspective and we settled that case. And so differences are expected and we worked through those just like we have done and we have a track record of doing that. Again, I would offer this and you have said this on the Q2 call and in other settings, this is an integrated resource plan and it's not a buffet. We've put together a great plan for Michigan. There was a winning in it for everyone. And so, we've been really clear about the need for recovery of, and on the asset. And so going forward, I mean, that's part of the plan and we've got testimony to support that. And as I stated earlier, when there's a win in there for everyone, there's a path to a good order and a good outcome. And so where there is differences, we have shown \u2013 we have the ability to work with everyone. And so again, I just see a nice positive outcome here in next year in 2022. Well, I would offer this. I mean, I don't have a visibility into the testimony until it's published. And so, I mean, obviously we had a great discussion with number of the interveners. We know some of their points of view where there might be good support and where there might be small differences. And so again, I would reflect on it this way. Again, we've done this in the past many times and rate cases and the like, and we've certainly done this with an IRP where there's differences. We find a way to work through those. And again, I think this afternoon, we're going to see, and I look forward to reading it. I think we're going to see supportive comments in general. And so when, again, when there's a winning in there for everyone, there's a path to a successful outcome. Now, I don't know if it's going to go down the path of settlement or we'll take it to the full order. But again, when there's a win there, there's an opportunity for success and that's what I'm confident about. This is a constructive regulatory environment. Julien, you know that, I know that and I really see this PFD as a bookend, as I stated earlier. And so the conversations that we have with staff in outside of cases is really how do we continue to ensure a safe and reliable natural gas system? How do we ensure and bring clean energy to Michigan? How do we ensure the reliability and resiliency in electric grid? And so those are in line with our goals and what we want to do as well. And so, we'll continue to be thoughtful about that process to make sure we balance customer's affordability with that. But I don't see any real change in plans as a result of a specific ALJ, PFD at all. Thanks, Julien. Thank you. Good morning, Travis. Well, two part, this one between Rejji , take the second question and I'll take the first piece. I would offer this, one again, conversation with the governor's office in which chair scripts have been constructive. And again, I don't want to speak for the chair, but I would offer this, the commission has been supportive of both our electric reliability spend as of recent the capital investments, as well as increased forestry spend. We increased our forestry spend this year by little over 60%, and that was supported through a rate case process by the commission and the commissioners understand that we're in the first year, that the number one cause for outages is tree trimming. And we have a very aggressive program now in place, which will benefit our customers. And so our commissioners, I believe, understand that we're in the early years of these larger investments and operational maintenance expense, which will help our customers. And so I think there's full recognition of that. I have not heard any talk at all, zero from the governor's office or from the commission on any sort of penalties associated with the storms in August. Thank you. Hey, Ryan, thanks for the question. So the EnerBank sale gross proceeds and the upside associated there was the key driver that enabled us to reduce our equity financing needs the year and the way it works. And it's a little nuanced I've been doing M&A for almost 20 years, but for Fincos or financial service companies, you have your traditional adjustments from signed to close on a working capital side, but from a financial service companies, you also get credit if the book equity of the business increases from signed to close, and we saw that with EnerBank's outperformance over those handful of months. And so that led to about $60 million of upside from the gross proceeds we announced at signing which was $960 million, not to the amount that we ultimately saw at closing, which was over $1 billion, call it, just under $1.20 billion. And so that's what gave us the upside and financial flexibility to reduce the equity needs. And so it's really a function of just that really strong performance at the bank that it created their book equity that gave us more proceeds at close. Yes. So remember we have about $57 million of equity forwards that we've already put in place. And we have been putting those in place even before we announced the sale of the bank. And so that gives you effectively a four for how low you're going to go, because at some point we will settle that. And so that's why we stopped at that sort of $57 million. It's because of the existing equity forwards we already have in place. Thanks. Thanks, Rocco. And I'd like to thank you all again for joining us today. We're looking forward to seeing you at EEI in the near future here and take care and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through August 5. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It\u2019s great to be with you, and we thank you for your continued interest and support. I\u2019m going to start today with the end in mind, strong quarter and a great first half of the year, giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range. Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I\u2019ll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. Needless to say, I\u2019m very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3 times book value, moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end, Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today\u2019s remarks. Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan, you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that\u2019s certainly in the time line for review. I\u2019m excited about this IRP. It\u2019s a remarkable plan. Many have set net zero goals. We have industry-leading net zero goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our investment thesis gets even simpler. But now it\u2019s also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan\u2019s supportive regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net zero commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about eight gigawatts of solar by 2040, two gigawatts from the previous plan. Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over two gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we\u2019ve done historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition to net zero carbon. And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We\u2019ve analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn\u2019t be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together. We\u2019ve done our homework, and I\u2019m confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan\u2019s strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan\u2019s forward-looking test years and the three-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. The visibility provided by Michigan\u2019s regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. On Slide six, you can see that our five-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current five-year plan, which we\u2019ll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our five-year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly seven million people in all 68 counties of Michigan\u2019s Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward. Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%. While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It\u2019s what you expect, it\u2019s what you own it, and it is big part of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will happen naturally, as we grow our earning. Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It\u2019s driven by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers\u2019 affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we\u2019ve grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I\u2019ll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji?\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you\u2019ll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we\u2019re on EnerBank, I\u2019ll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank\u2019s EPS contribution last year. The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. All in, we\u2019re tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide nine provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering toward the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We\u2019ll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of pickup. And I\u2019ll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. Turning to our financing plan for the year. I\u2019m pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out the financing plan, I\u2019ll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by one year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. Lastly, I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that later today, we\u2019ll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Rejji, and thank you, Glenn, for your service. As we\u2019ve highlighted today, we\u2019ve had a great first half of the year. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results. We\u2019re positioned well to continue that momentum into the second half of the year as we focus on finalizing the sale of the bank and moving through the IRP process. I\u2019m proud to lead this great team, and we can\u2019t wait to share our success as we move forward together. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning Jeremy, how are you?\nRejji Hayes: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Good, thanks. Just wanted to start, you mentioned growing earnings at the high end of the 6% to 8% range, and kind of as the proceeds get redeployed here over time. Just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more. If there\u2019s any more color you can provide on how to think about the timing here? It seems like a lot of opportunity with the IRP. But how should we think about the high end? I mean basically, I\u2019m trying to think what type of glide path could we see where the earnings trajectory could overlap, I guess, pre EnerBank guide at that point?\nGarrick Rochow: Jerry, I think you said some key words, opportunity in one word I\u2019d add -- or two words, I guess, I would add to that is, upward momentum. And so off of 2022, 6% to 8%, we\u2019re going to lever toward the high end of that through 2025. And then when I think about the IRP, there\u2019s obviously two big tranches, let\u2019s say, Covert in 2023 and the acquisition of that facility and also the enterprise facilities on 2025. Those are incremental to the plan, to the capital plan. And those strengthen and lengthen that growth through that time period. And so again, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on that. And I think this is a great plan with upward momentum as we look at that time period from 2022 to 2025.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks to that. And then I know we\u2019re early in the IRP process here. But just wondering if you could expand a bit more, I guess, on early stakeholder feedback in just your thoughts at this point. \nGarrick Rochow: Jeremy, I wish you could see my face, I\u2019ve got a big grin on my face. I\u2019m smiling. I love to have a case where there\u2019s no push back and there\u2019s no innovators that happened with every case, as you well know. But here\u2019s where I see the IRP there is a win in here and this is why it\u2019s remarkably there\u2019s a win for everyone that saw the intervenors or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community 60% reduction in Co2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris Accord the 2 degree and the 1.5 degrees scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. A big one for our customers affordability, $650 million of savings. That\u2019s a great opportunity. Reliability or maybe better state and resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan that our previous IRP. We have done more homework to ensure that we don\u2019t have a Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors over a billion dollars of incremental investment. The ability to treat these assets, and other securitization is voluntary. The ability to treat these assets, the existing assets than the book value as a regulatory asset process. I feel really good. There\u2019s a winning here for everyone. And then there\u2019s a win for everyone the opportunity to reach settlement and even if it\u2019s not fair enough to go the whole distance I feel really good about that. And just one last reminder on this 2018 IRP number of intervenors engaged with that. We settled that case, 21 IRP number of intervenors in that case, and with that pattern of wins that I just walked through, there\u2019s a great way that we can reach a great outcome of our IRP, feel good about it Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Got you. That\u2019s really helpful. Sounds promising just a small one if I could just want to reconcile I think the equity 100 million for the balance of the year, I think was in the slide in a good chunk that already locked in. But were there any comments as possible, even less than that? Just want to make sure I had that straight as far as what the equity thoughts were for the balance of the year?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. I am going to move to Rejji about that one. \nRejji Hayes:  Yes. Good morning Jeremy. Good question. So where we sit today, we\u2019re comfortable saying up to 100 because of the preferred stock issuance. And remember, we\u2019ve got a little north of 50 million of that already locked in through fours. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate opportunities over the course of this year. And if we can reduce that, we may do that. But for now, we\u2019re comfortable saying up to 100 million. \nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll stop there. Thanks. \nGarrick Rochow: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. Just first question is following up on Jeremy\u2019s question on the earnings growth trajectories, I just want to clarify from my end that you\u2019re saying often to 2022 a guidance range your growth is going to be toward the upper end of 6 to 8 percent range through 2025 and that irregardless of whether the hierarchy [indiscernible].\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks for your question. It\u2019s great to hear from you. That\u2019s exactly what we stated six to eight. We expect to deliver toward the high end and the IRP cohort and those enterprises assets strengthen and lengthen that path. So absolutely.\nInsoo Kim: Okay. Got it. Got it. And then just -- so picking the IRP side, you\u2019ve been so consistent in achieving that 10% range like clockwork for a long time. I guess, going to that upper end, again, excluding the IRP, what kind of gives you confidence that maybe that could -- what the longer-term run rate could be of that type of growth rate?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I\u2019d actually started with this year in 2021. This momentum that we have right now carries into 2022. Hopefully, you heard that in our comments from the $2.85 to $2.87, and we\u2019ll continue to revisit that on the quarterly calls. But again, that carries into this plan. And remember what we do, we rebase off that source. So we deliver, we either meet or exceed guidance. And then that\u2019s the point where we rebase off of. And so it\u2019s that compounding effect that you\u2019ve seen time and time again. And so that\u2019s an important piece of it. But also we think about the entire triple bottom line. And so I think a great example of this IRP, we\u2019re going to put $1.3 billion in, and it saves our customers $650 million. That\u2019s at CE Way mindset coming play, making these investments, attacking the cost stack, share of wallets 3%. It was 4% went to 3% share wallet. So we balance all those things, the affordability, the balance sheet and make this come together. So again, I feel really confident about our glide path forward. And Rejji, might have some comments on that as well.\nRejji Hayes: Insoo, the only thing I would add to Garrick\u2019s good comments is, as you think longer term, we noted in the IRP that we intend to do about eight gigawatts of solar new build, and that\u2019s about two gigawatts higher than the prior plan. And so that creates additional capital investment opportunities. We\u2019re assuming it\u2019s a similar construct where it\u2019s about 50% owned and 50% contracted. However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we\u2019ve talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next five-year plan, but there\u2019ll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether it\u2019s through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, well, that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital. So we feel very good about the long-term glide path for capital growth, which drives rate base growth and then earnings.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. That\u2019s definitely helpful. Just one more, if I could. Going back to that IRP plan, I think a lot of the questions that people have is whether this plan, which basically swaps out coal for at least in the interim, gassing the portfolio, and how that will be received by the various stakeholders. I appreciate your comments on working with the various stakeholders as well as the commission on this type of plan. But how confident are you in this time being the best one? And if there are some, I guess, room for negotiation, if this doesn\u2019t end up being the best plan for the commission, what are some of the alternatives that could potentially also work?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, this is the best plan for Michigan. One of the things that our first IRP taught us is that -- we learned a lot from that. And this is, I would just say, a great plan, remarkable plan for all the reasons I mentioned a few minutes ago. And so there\u2019s a win in here for everyone. And when there\u2019s a win, there\u2019s an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance. And so again, I would just reference 2018. We were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement. But that\u2019s what\u2019s great about this regulatory construct. We\u2019re working with these interveners in the process. And if there\u2019s an opportunity to settle where there\u2019s an outcome that is good for all, we will do that. And so we\u2019re early on into -- and again, I\u2019m very optimistic we have a great plan. And I don\u2019t know Rejji, do you want to add to that?\nRejji Hayes: Insoo, the only thing I would add to that is that trust that we evaluated the number of different permutations that as instructed for the IRP construct. And so we certainly looked at whether we could transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the economics just don\u2019t get you there, plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends given the lack of really long-term storage solutions. And so we certainly evaluated it. But as Garrick noted, we deem this plan where it sits today as the best plan for Michigan. And also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the O&M and capital we know we would have on our coal facilities, you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch. It just brings substantial cost savings to customers, which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a bridge fuel. So we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, I\u2019m going to add to that. I just want to be just crystal clear on this, not only affordability piece, but those natural gas plants are required for resiliency in the state. You can\u2019t get here from there. That\u2019s just bottom line. And so it\u2019s that crystal clear. And that\u2019s why I have just a high degree of confidence.\nInsoo Kim: Thanks for the color. Thank you so much. \nOperator: And our question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. \nGarrick Rochow: Hey Anthony.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning Garrick. Thank you so much. Just one quick question on the dividend. You\u2019ve laid out a nice plan for earnings growth rate, and you\u2019re pretty confident in that 2025 high end. But you -- what\u2019s your concern over providing that type of detail on the dividend growth rate?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, you said pretty confident. I would change that word to really confident. And so there\u2019s a little bit [indiscernible] your question. But I\u2019m equally confident in our dividend piece. And what you heard from me is that confidence in dividend growth for 2022, we recognize the importance of it, and we have it built into our financial plan. I really want to hand it over to Rejji here because there is an important piece that\u2019s associated with the sale of the bank and closure in Q4 that also shapes that dividend. And so that\u2019s why we\u2019re -- most pieces have to come together so that we can share that potential here at the end of the year. But go ahead, Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, that\u2019s right. So if you think about some of the dynamism we might see in the second half of the year, the closing and the timing of the closing of the EnerBank transaction could certainly impact what we might plan to do for 2022 dividend. But to go back to Garrick\u2019s comments, our commitment is to grow the dividend beyond the $1.74 per share, where it is today. And then longer term, again, we\u2019ll certainly have that dividend grow commensurate with earnings. But certainly, the bank sale and the timing of that will have an impact in the near term and then longer term, again, right in line with earnings growth. And so we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend. And we know that it\u2019s a core part of our value proposition, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: And just add to that. There\u2019s -- with the sale and that closure there, there\u2019s upside potential there from a dividend perspective, again. So we want to be able to -- our investors to be able to share some of that positive news.\nAnthony Crowdell: If I could just jump in with one last question related to the IRP. Is there any part of the IRP you think maybe be the most challenging or may generate the most concern with the interveners?\nGarrick Rochow: I don\u2019t know about most challenging. I think that\u2019s -- I\u2019ll just tell you this, Anthony. Back in 2014 and 2015, I was a policy witness. I\u2019ve been on the stand with interveners been crossed by attorneys. They go after a lot of different things in the case. And here\u2019s -- again, we\u2019ve got strong testimony. We got great precedent. We\u2019re used to this stuff. We do this all the time with our rate cases. We\u2019ve done it with a previous IRP. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything this team can\u2019t handle, frankly. And so -- and we\u2019re prepared to do that. As Rejji alluded to a minute ago, there\u2019s a lot of detail, a lot of modeling and data that went into this. And so it\u2019s a very strong case.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great, thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning team. Thanks for taking my question.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just on the IRP. I noticed that you proposed a couple of coal plant shutdowns but then including them in the rate base post their shutdown, just kind of curious as to sort of if the state has done that previously, or are there some precedent there that you feel comfortable with that proposal?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I do feel comfortable with it. There\u2019s a precedent set in Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin for a similar approach in Michigan. We do have a nice ability to securitize, but it is voluntary, and that\u2019s an important piece of this. And so it\u2019s essentially -- in 2025, it\u2019s about $1.2 billion of remaining book value, to going through and securitize that just doesn\u2019t make sense. This is going to be a drag in credit metrics. They have an impact on cost of capital, which ultimately shows up on the customers\u2019 bill. That\u2019s -- I mean, that doesn\u2019t make sense. And so we\u2019ve really got a good approach there. It\u2019s different than how we\u2019ve approached it previously. But again, there\u2019s a nice precedent that\u2019s been set, and I\u2019m really -- the testimony -- I\u2019ve reviewed the testimony, it\u2019s -- we\u2019re in a good spot.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. I appreciate the color there. And obviously, you can always fall back to securitization if that leads -- if that ends up being the case. But I appreciate the color there. And then just maybe to Rejji, can you clarify sort of the -- I\u2019m trying to see the equity elimination through 2024. You don\u2019t talk about 2025. So should we assume sort of the normal cadence of equity, I believe that was $250 million per year, to go back to that starting in 2025. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that to the comment that the $1 billion additional in the IRP, you don\u2019t need to finance that with equity. Just any color there, Rejji, would be helpful.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Happy to, Durgesh. First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We\u2019re not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick\u2019s comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we\u2019ve already done with the inclusion of Con one and two in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you\u2019re right in that as we disclosed when we announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we\u2019ve announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our five-year plan. So that\u2019s still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there\u2019s a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful?\nUnidentified Analyst: Very helpful. And thanks for clarifying that securitization comment.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you. \nRejji Hayes: Thanks. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: This is actually Constantine here for Shar. But I think if I may -- if I can just follow up on kind of one more kind of, I guess, IRP capex-related question. What are some of the constructs that are -- that the incremental portion of capex fall under? Is it all fully covered by the IRP as proposed, plus kind of the annual rate case process that you have? Any kind of -- does any of the non-IRP work can need any incremental trackers? But does any of this incremental work can start prompting more equity needs down the line? Or is it fully kind of baked in at this point?\nGarrick Rochow: I think Rejji and I will tag team this one. And so let me just kind of frame up when I think about our capital plans. And I think we\u2019ll talk about our current work across our utility but also this IRP. And so at the end of the year, in our January call, we\u2019re going to add another year to that five-year capital plan, and that\u2019s going to be more capital opportunity. That five-year plan is going to grow. And it\u2019s going to be in our gas business, it\u2019s going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there\u2019s some growth opportunity there. Then we\u2019ll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that\u2019s an incremental 1.3. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we\u2019re going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Covert facility. And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the five years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from \u201825 to \u201827. And so some of that still will be able to fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there\u2019s some update that will take place along those lines. So that\u2019s kind of the capital layout. But, Rejji, certainly, tag team this with me.\nRejji Hayes: Sure, happy to. So Constantine, I appreciate the question. We\u2019re pretty methodical. So I\u2019ll put the IRP aside, we\u2019re pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current five-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I\u2019ll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of -year plans. And so we\u2019ll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we\u2019re doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we\u2019re seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we\u2019re still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche, and we\u2019re going to own half of that. And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we\u2019ll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn\u2019t do all of that in the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it\u2019s more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new IRP. We\u2019re highly confident that we\u2019ll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that\u2019s in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don\u2019t have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense?\nUnidentified Analyst: It does. I think that\u2019s very helpful. And if I may shift a little bit to more of a fundamental question. So the electric sales volumes seem to be normalizing with reopening more or less and especially with the strong kind of C&I growth and residential coming down a bit, can you kind of talk about your thoughts on the residential load and how sticky it is versus expectations? And maybe kind of the reversion of the residential load causing headwinds in terms of earnings for \u201821 or expectations in \u201822?\nGarrick Rochow: I\u2019m going to have Rejji start with some of the specifics and then I\u2019ll talk about some macro at the end. So Rejji, why don\u2019t you grab it?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Constantine, we\u2019ve been quite pleased with what we\u2019ve seen really across all of the customer classes to date. And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide just we distributed. Also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we\u2019ve got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we\u2019re ahead of plan. So that does imply that we\u2019re seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that\u2019s higher-margin load. And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we\u2019re also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we\u2019re seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you\u2019re introducing more kilowatt hours into the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It\u2019s still early days; the pandemic is not behind us yet. But again, we\u2019re still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we\u2019ve talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests; they\u2019re up over 30% year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction.\nGarrick Rochow: I\u2019ll just add to that, just a little bit of clarification. So those new service connections -- interconnections, those are installs. Those aren\u2019t someone dreaming of a house or thinking about a business. Those are actually in the ground. And so again, it gives you some idea of the momentum here. We continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan in the heart of our service territory. Grand Rapids, it\u2019s even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we\u2019ve even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we\u2019re under an NDA right now with the company. But it\u2019s $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are locating here in our service territory in Michigan. And I could [indiscernible] two other examples of that. And so coming out of the pandemic here, and we\u2019re seeing a nice economic development growth here in Michigan as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks so much for taking the questions and congrats on the great quarter. \nGarrick Rochow: Thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.\nPaul Patterson: Good morning guys, how are you doing?\nGarrick Rochow: Good. We\u2019re doing great Paul.\nPaul Patterson: So most of my questions been answered but just back on that securitization question. Could you remind me the size of the asset that\u2019s now going to be amortized as opposed to  securitized? \nGarrick Rochow: Yes. The remaining book value in 2025 of the those coal plants would be $1.2 billion. That is another consideration in this filing.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. And you guys mentioned that the securitization you thought would be credit negative in comparison to the plan that you\u2019re putting forward. And could you -- I mean, just to sort of walk just sort of very high level, the reason for that is because you\u2019ll be amortizing the cash flow faster. Is that the way to sort of think about the -- excuse me, you\u2019ll be amortizing the assets faster and the cash flow will be stronger, is that how you\u2019re looking at this? Or is there something else I should be thinking about?\nRejji Hayes: So Paul, this is Rejji. So a couple of things there. So Moody\u2019s, as you may recall, treat securitized debt as debt in their metric calculations. And so you have that levering effect of securitizations because they are effectively nonrecourse debt, but Moody\u2019s is the one rating agency that does impute it as debt. And so that $1.2 billion that Garrick noted would be dollar-for-dollar accounted as debt in our credit metric calculations. So you\u2019ve got credit dilution there. And then you couple that with the fact that you\u2019re going to forego earnings on $1.2 billion of rate base over time. And so you couple sort of the impact on the denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of $1.2 billion, and then you have the dilution in your numerator because you\u2019re foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period of time. That\u2019s what offers that levering effect.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. I follow you on that. Of course, you\u2019re getting the cash upfront though with the securitization. So I mean, I\u2019m just sort of -- maybe we can take that off-line, but okay, I understand that. And then in terms of the plan, I mean, it sounds like it really is a win-win-win. I\u2019m just wondering, has there been any change in the trajectory or your -- what you\u2019re expecting in terms of customer rates going forward, as a result of the IRP? Or is it too early to sort of tell? Are you guys pretty much on track as you were thinking before, and this is just going to be some incremental savings that will help you meet your goals? Do you follow what I\u2019m saying?\nGarrick Rochow: I do follow what you\u2019re saying. And so we look at -- across that 5-year plan of investments we look at the rate impact and two, the bill impact, which is also critically important for our residential and commercial customers. And so that is part of the five year. And as we -- again, this incremental capital of $1.3 billion, it provides $650 million of savings over our current plan. And so this is -- so again, this comes together nicely to your point, Paul, from an affordability perspective for our customers.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. well awesome thanks so much and congratulations. \nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thank you Paul.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes the question and answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Well again I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Again strong quarter, great first half of the year and upward momentum and just again I\u2019m looking forward to seeing everyone in person here as we again faithfully as we move through the latter half of the year. Take care and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. Before I walk through the details of our financial results for the quarter, you'll note that throughout our materials, we have reported the financial performance of EnerBank as discontinued operations, thereby removing it as a reportable segment and adjusting our quarterly and year-to-date results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. And while we're on EnerBank, I'll share that the sale process continues to progress nicely, as the merger application was filed in June with the various federal and state regulators will be evaluating the transaction for approval, and we continue to expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year. Moving on to continuing operations. For the second quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $158 million or $0.55 per share, which excludes $0.07 from EnerBank. For comparative purposes, our second quarter adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $0.09 above our second quarter 2020 results, exclusive of EnerBank's EPS contribution last year. The key drivers of our financial performance for the quarter were rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, recovering commercial and industrial sales and the usual strong tax planning. Year-to-date, we delivered adjusted net income from continuing operations of $472 million or $1.64 per share, which excludes $0.19 per share from EnerBank and is up $0.37 per share versus the first half of 2020, assuming a comparable adjustment for discontinued operations. All in, we're tracking well ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics to date, which offers great financial flexibility for the second half of the year. The waterfall chart on Slide nine provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020. As a reminder, this walk excludes the financial performance of EnerBank. For the first half of 2021, rate relief has been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.36 per share given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for electric and gas businesses. As a reminder, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs at the utility. The rate relief related upside in 2021 has been partially offset by the planned increases in our operating and maintenance expenses to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization. As a reminder, these expenses align with our recent rate orders and equate to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus 2020. It is also worth noting that this calculation also includes cost savings realized to date, largely due to our waste elimination efforts through the CE Way, which are ahead of plan. We also benefited in the first half of 2021 from favorable weather relative to 2020 in the amount of $0.06 per share and recovering commercial and industrial sales, which coupled with solid tax planning provided $0.01 per share of positive variance in aggregate. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we feel quite good about the glide path to delivering toward the high end of our EPS guidance range, as Garrick noted. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case, translates to $0.02 per share of negative variance, given the absence of the favorable weather experienced in the second half of 2020. We'll continue to benefit from the residual impact of rate relief, which equates to $0.12 per share of pickup. And I'll remind you, is not subject to any further MPSC actions. We also continue to execute on our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate will have a financial impact of $0.21 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2020 given anticipated reinvestments in the second half of the year. We have also seen the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales assumptions and our nonutility segment performance, which as a reminder, now excludes EnerBank. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the latter part of 2021. Turning to our financing plan for the year. I'm pleased to highlight our recent successful issuance of $230 million of preferred stock at an annual rate of 4.2%, one of the lowest rates ever achieved for a preferred offering of its kind. This transaction satisfies the vast majority of funding needs of CMS Energy, our parent company for the year and given the high level of equity content ascribed to the security by the rating agencies, we have reduced our planned equity issuance needs for the year to up to $100 million from up to $250 million. As a reminder, over half of the $100 million of revised equity issuance needs for the year are already contracted via equity forwards. It is also worth noting that given the terms and conditions of the EnerBank merger agreement in the event EnerBank continues to outperform the financial plan prior to the closing of the transaction, we would have a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the increase in book equity value at closing, which could further reduce our financing needs for 2021 and provide additional financial flexibility in 2022. Closing out the financing plan, I'll also highlight that we recently extended our long-term credit facilities by one year to 2024, both at the parent and the utility. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that later today, we'll file our 10-Q, which will be the last 10-Q owned by Glenn Barba, our Chief Accounting Officer, who most of you know from his days leading our IR team. Glenn announced his retirement earlier this year after serving admirably for nearly 25 years at CMS, which included him signing over 75 quarterly SEC filings during his tenure. Glenn, thank you for your wonderful service to CMS. You certainly left it better than you found it, and we wish you the very best in this next chapter in your life. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before we open it up for Q&A. Good morning. Yes. Good morning Jeremy. Good question. So where we sit today, we're comfortable saying up to 100 because of the preferred stock issuance. And remember, we've got a little north of 50 million of that already locked in through fours. We'll continue to evaluate opportunities over the course of this year. And if we can reduce that, we may do that. But for now, we're comfortable saying up to 100 million. Insoo, the only thing I would add to Garrick's good comments is, as you think longer term, we noted in the IRP that we intend to do about eight gigawatts of solar new build, and that's about two gigawatts higher than the prior plan. And so that creates additional capital investment opportunities. We're assuming it's a similar construct where it's about 50% owned and 50% contracted. However, if we continue to be more and more cost competitive, that could create additional upside to own more of that opportunity over time. You couple that with the fact that we've talked about the $3 billion to $4 billion of upside opportunities in our 10-year capital plan, a portion of which we think will be in our next five-year plan, but there'll still be balance after that. And so as we continue to take costs, whether it's through the CE Way or some of these episodic opportunities like PPAs, repricing and so on, well, that creates more headroom to bring in that additional capital. So we feel very good about the long-term glide path for capital growth, which drives rate base growth and then earnings. Insoo, the only thing I would add to that is that trust that we evaluated the number of different permutations that as instructed for the IRP construct. And so we certainly looked at whether we could transition to renewable power more rapidly or fully in as a substitute for the retirements and the economics just don't get you there, plus you also introduce significant reliability and resilience trends given the lack of really long-term storage solutions. And so we certainly evaluated it. But as Garrick noted, we deem this plan where it sits today as the best plan for Michigan. And also with the gas facilities and obviously foregoing the O&M and capital we know we would have on our coal facilities, you take that into account with the fuel arbitrage you get from gas versus coal and just less purchases you now have controllable dispatch. It just brings substantial cost savings to customers, which would not be offered if we went to a full renewable solution in lieu of gas as a bridge fuel. So we feel like this is the most economic opportunity for all stakeholders. Yes, that's right. So if you think about some of the dynamism we might see in the second half of the year, the closing and the timing of the closing of the EnerBank transaction could certainly impact what we might plan to do for 2022 dividend. But to go back to Garrick's comments, our commitment is to grow the dividend beyond the $1.74 per share, where it is today. And then longer term, again, we'll certainly have that dividend grow commensurate with earnings. But certainly, the bank sale and the timing of that will have an impact in the near term and then longer term, again, right in line with earnings growth. And so we feel highly confident that we will have a competitive dividend. And we know that it's a core part of our value proposition, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks. Yes. Happy to, Durgesh. First, let me just circle back to your closing comment just to be unambiguous around this. And so the notion of falling back on this securitization. As we noted when we rolled out the IRP, as we noted in our prepared remarks, this is the proposed plan. This is not a buffet. We're not thinking about any type of fallback option. And again, from a securitization perspective, to Garrick's comments, given the impact it could have on our balance sheet, we've already done with the inclusion of Con one and two in the retirement and securitization there, we will already have $1 billion of securitized debt on our balance sheet as of 2023. So we really cannot accommodate alternatives like that. So I want to be very clear, we do not view that as a fallback option and the proposed plan is what it is. So with respect to the question around equity, yes, you're right in that as we disclosed when we announced the EnerBank sale, we are not planning to issue any equity from 2022 through 2024, even with the capital opportunities that we've announced today with the IRP and potentially some of that upside opportunity. So no additional equity. For 2025, you can assume the up to $250 million level that we articulated when we first rolled out our five-year plan. So that's still a good working assumption for now. But obviously, there's a lot of time left. And if we can recalibrate and see the data moving away that supports reducing that, at some point, we may revisit that. But for now, assume $250 million in that out of year of 2025. Is that helpful? Thanks. Sure, happy to. So Constantine, I appreciate the question. We're pretty methodical. So I'll put the IRP aside, we're pretty methodical in how we think about the capital plan of the utility. And we really spend a lot of time providing long-term visibility on customer investment opportunities across each of the businesses. And so the current five-year plan has around $2.5 billion of what I'll call clean energy generation spend. And then the balance is electric and gas infrastructure spend. And so we noted when we filed our gas case a couple of years ago that we had about $10 billion of gas infrastructure-related investments for safety, reliability and decarbonization of about $1 billion per year of run rate. And so you can expect an extension of that capital investment opportunity and subsequent iterations of -year plans. And so we'll do more gas infrastructure. And again, we run about $1 billion per year run rate in that regard. Electric infrastructure is comparable, where we're doing a little over $1 billion per year of electric infrastructure work to improve reliability. And the IRP is also where we're seeing capital investment opportunities. So the existing IRP, remember, we're still executing on a 1.1-gigawatt tranche, and we're going to own half of that. And so all of that is going to be part of the next iteration. And so those are the sort of non-new IRP opportunities. Again, we'll see those come in, and we also talked about starting to take on some of those upside opportunities, which in our 10-year plan of $3 billion to $4 billion, we wouldn't do all of that in the next vintage, but a portion of it. And again, it's more electric and gas infrastructure, as well as clean energy generation related spend. And so those would be some of the projects that we would invest in beyond this new IRP. We're highly confident that we'll be able to create the headroom to introduce those into the capital plan. You asked about trackers. The only thing I would mention in that regard is in our gas infrastructure capital plan, we do have the equivalent or comparable structure, like a tracker and that's in our enhanced infrastructure replacement program. And so we have that on the gas side, but we don't have any other say sort of a historical type trackers like that. And so we obviously put them into the cases we filed on a serial basis and then that dictates what ends up in the final plan. Does that make sense? Yes. Constantine, we've been quite pleased with what we've seen really across all of the customer classes to date. And so we have good detail on the 15-page guide just we distributed. Also in the appendix, you can see the year-to-date trends in the presentation today. And so we've got residential year-to-date down a little over 1%. That compares favorably to plan. We had much more bearish expectations because we were assuming a more rapid return to facilities. And so our full year plan was something closer to down roughly 5% and we're ahead of plan. So that does imply that we're seeing a good level of stickiness to this mass teleworking trend, which I do think will be part of a post-pandemic normal. And obviously, that's higher-margin load. And so residential continues to outperform our expectations. And then we're also seeing commercial and industrial, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, come back nicely. And so year-to-date, commercial is up around 3.5%. And we had in our plan about that level and then industrials at 13% year-to-date, 2021 versus 2020. And our plan, we said on a full year basis, about 6% up. And so we're seeing surprise to the upside across all fronts. And so intra-year, that obviously creates upside and potential contingencies as we go into the second half of the year. But longer term, as you roll that into your rate cases, that creates headroom because you're introducing more kilowatt hours into the denominator of your rate calculation. So we feel very good about the road ahead to date. It's still early days; the pandemic is not behind us yet. But again, we're still seeing very encouraging trends on the load side. The other leading indicators we've talked about in the past are just interconnection activities, new service requests; they're up over 30% year-to-date versus where they were in 2020. And 2020 may not be the best comp given the pandemic. So we also look at 2019, again, up 30% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So interconnections are strong, staking requests are strong. Customer counts are quite good with commercial up 1%. And so again, everything seems to be trending from a load perspective in the right direction. So Paul, this is Rejji. So a couple of things there. So Moody's, as you may recall, treat securitized debt as debt in their metric calculations. And so you have that levering effect of securitizations because they are effectively nonrecourse debt, but Moody's is the one rating agency that does impute it as debt. And so that $1.2 billion that Garrick noted would be dollar-for-dollar accounted as debt in our credit metric calculations. So you've got credit dilution there. And then you couple that with the fact that you're going to forego earnings on $1.2 billion of rate base over time. And so you couple sort of the impact on the denominator where you just have dollar for dollar debt of $1.2 billion, and then you have the dilution in your numerator because you're foregoing earnings on that equity portion of that rate base over that period of time. That's what offers that levering effect."

            "content": "Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. It's great to be with you, and we thank you for your continued interest and support. I'm going to start today with the end in mind, strong quarter and a great first half of the year, giving us confidence as we target the high end of the guidance range. Rejji will walk through the details of the quarter, and I'll share what the strong results mean for 2021 earnings. Needless to say, I'm very pleased. An important gene sale of EnerBank at 3 times book value, moving from noncore to the core business with a strong focus on regulated utility growth. The sale of the bank provides for greater financial flexibility, eliminating planned equity issuance from 2022 to 2024. And in the end, Reggie will share how we have reduced our equity issuance need for 2021 in today's remarks. Furthermore, with the filing of our integrated resource plan, you can see the path for more than $1 billion into the utility, again, without equity issuance. Not only is there visibility to that investment, that's certainly in the time line for review. I'm excited about this IRP. It's a remarkable plan. Many have set net zero goals. We have industry-leading net zero goals and this IRP provides a path and is an important proof point in our commitment. We are leading the clean energy transformation. It starts with our investment thesis. This simple but intentional approach has stood the test of time and continues to be our approach going forward. It is grounded in a balanced commitment to all our stakeholders and enables us to continue to deliver on our financial objectives. With the sale of EnerBank and the plan to exit coal by 2025, our investment thesis gets even simpler. But now it's also cleaner and leaner. We continue to mature and strengthen our lean operating system, the CE Way, which delivers value by reducing cost and improving quality, ensuring affordability for our customers, and our thesis is further strengthened by Michigan's supportive regulatory construct. All of this supports our long-term adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8%, and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. All of this remains solidly grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. As I mentioned, our integrated resource plan provides the proof points to our investment thesis, our net zero commitments and highlights our commitment to the triple bottom line by accelerating our decarbonization efforts, making us one of the first utility in the nation to exit coal or increasing our renewable build-out, adding about eight gigawatts of solar by 2040, two gigawatts from the previous plan. Furthermore, this plan ensures reliability, a critical attribute as we place more intermittent resources on the grid. The purchase of over two gigawatts of existing natural gas generation allows us to exit coal and dramatically reduces our carbon footprint. Existing natural gas generation is key. And like we've done historically with the purchases of our Zeeland and Jackson generating stations. This is a sweet spot for us where we reduce permitting, construction and start-up risk. It is also thoughtful and that is not a 40- to 50-year commitment that you would get with a new asset, which we believe is important, as we transition to net zero carbon. And, yes, on other hand, our plan is affordable for our customers. It will generate $650 million of savings, essentially paying for our transition to clean energy. This is truly a remarkable plan. It is carefully considered and data-driven. We've analyzed hundreds of scenarios with different sensitivities and our plan was thoughtfully developed with extensive stakeholder engagement. I couldn't be more proud of this plan and especially the team that put it together. We've done our homework, and I'm confident it is the best plan for our customers, our coworkers, for great state of Michigan, of course, you, our investors to hit the triple bottom line. The Integrated Resource Plan is a key element of Michigan's strong regulatory construct, which is known across the industry as one of the best. It is a result of legislation designed to ensure a primary recovery of the necessary investments to advance safe and reliable energy in our state. Michigan's forward-looking test years and the three-year pre-approval structure of the IRP process is visibility on our future growth. It enables us and the commission to align on long-term generation planning and provide greater certainty as we invest in our clean energy transformation. We anticipate an initial order for the IRP from the commission in April and a final order in June of next year. The visibility provided by Michigan's regulatory construct enables us to grow our capital plan to make the needed investments on our system. On Slide six, you can see that our five-year capital plan has grown every year. Our current five-year plan, which we'll update on our year-end call includes $13.2 billion of needed customer investment. It does not contain the upside in our IRP. The IRP provides a clear line of sight to the timing and composition of an incremental $1.3 billion of opportunity. And as I shared on the previous slide, the regulatory construct provides timely approval of future capital expenditures. I really like this path forward. And beyond our IRP, there is plenty of opportunity for our five-year capital plan to grow given the customer investment opportunities we have in our 10-year plan. Our backlog of needing investments is as vast as our system, which serves nearly seven million people in all 68 counties of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. We see industry-leading growth continuing well into the future. So where does that put us today? As I stated in my opening remarks, we had a strong quarter and a great first half of the year. The bank sale and now the IRP filing provide important context for our future growth and positioning of the business. Let me share my confidence. For 2021, we are focused on delivering adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.61 to $2.65 per share, and we expect to deliver toward the high end of that range. For 2022, we are reaffirming our adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.87 per share. Given the strong performance we are seeing this year, the reduced financing needs next year and continued investments in the utility, there is upward momentum as we move forward. Now many of you have asked about the dividend. We are reaffirming again no change to the $1.74 dividend for 2021. As we move forward, we are committed to growing the dividend in line with earnings with a target payout ratio of about 60%. While we are not going to provide 2022 dividend guidance on this call, I want to be very clear, we are committed to growing the dividend in 2022. It's what you expect, it's what you own it, and it is big part of our value. I will offer this. Our target payout ratio does not need to be achieved immediately, it will happen naturally, as we grow our earning. Finally, I want to touch on long-term growth rate, which is 6% to 8%. This has not changed. It's driven by the capital investment needs of our system, our customers' affordability and the need for a healthy balance sheet to fund those investments. Historically, we've grown at 7%. But as we redeploy the proceeds from the bank, we will deliver toward the high end through 2025. I'll also remind you that we tend to rebase higher off of actuals. We have historically either met or exceeded our guidance. All in, a strong quarter, positioned well for 2021 with upward momentum and with EnerBank and the IRP, it all comes together nicely positioned for the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji to discuss the details of our quarterly and year-to-date earnings. Rejji? Thanks, Rejji, and thank you, Glenn, for your service. As we've highlighted today, we've had a great first half of the year. We are pleased to have delivered such strong results. We're positioned well to continue that momentum into the second half of the year as we focus on finalizing the sale of the bank and moving through the IRP process. I'm proud to lead this great team, and we can't wait to share our success as we move forward together. This is an exciting time at CMS Energy. With that, Rocco, please open the lines for Q&A. Good morning Jeremy, how are you? Jerry, I think you said some key words, opportunity in one word I'd add -- or two words, I guess, I would add to that is, upward momentum. And so off of 2022, 6% to 8%, we're going to lever toward the high end of that through 2025. And then when I think about the IRP, there's obviously two big tranches, let's say, Covert in 2023 and the acquisition of that facility and also the enterprise facilities on 2025. Those are incremental to the plan, to the capital plan. And those strengthen and lengthen that growth through that time period. And so again, I feel confident in our ability to deliver on that. And I think this is a great plan with upward momentum as we look at that time period from 2022 to 2025. Jeremy, I wish you could see my face, I've got a big grin on my face. I'm smiling. I love to have a case where there's no push back and there's no innovators that happened with every case, as you well know. But here's where I see the IRP there is a win in here and this is why it's remarkably there's a win for everyone that saw the intervenors or stakeholders. When I think about the environmental community 60% reduction in Co2, well above and beyond the requirements of the Paris Accord the 2 degree and the 1.5 degrees scenario, well above and beyond what Biden proposed for 2030. So a big win for the environmental community in there. A big one for our customers affordability, $650 million of savings. That's a great opportunity. Reliability or maybe better state and resiliency of the electric grid. This is a more reliable plan that our previous IRP. We have done more homework to ensure that we don't have a Texas like situation as we look forward to the future with intermittent resource. I feel really great about that. And then for our investors over a billion dollars of incremental investment. The ability to treat these assets, and other securitization is voluntary. The ability to treat these assets, the existing assets than the book value as a regulatory asset process. I feel really good. There's a winning here for everyone. And then there's a win for everyone the opportunity to reach settlement and even if it's not fair enough to go the whole distance I feel really good about that. And just one last reminder on this 2018 IRP number of intervenors engaged with that. We settled that case, 21 IRP number of intervenors in that case, and with that pattern of wins that I just walked through, there's a great way that we can reach a great outcome of our IRP, feel good about it Jeremy. Yes. I am going to move to Rejji about that one. Thank you. Thanks for your question. It's great to hear from you. That's exactly what we stated six to eight. We expect to deliver toward the high end and the IRP cohort and those enterprises assets strengthen and lengthen that path. So absolutely. Well, I'd actually started with this year in 2021. This momentum that we have right now carries into 2022. Hopefully, you heard that in our comments from the $2.85 to $2.87, and we'll continue to revisit that on the quarterly calls. But again, that carries into this plan. And remember what we do, we rebase off that source. So we deliver, we either meet or exceed guidance. And then that's the point where we rebase off of. And so it's that compounding effect that you've seen time and time again. And so that's an important piece of it. But also we think about the entire triple bottom line. And so I think a great example of this IRP, we're going to put $1.3 billion in, and it saves our customers $650 million. That's at CE Way mindset coming play, making these investments, attacking the cost stack, share of wallets 3%. It was 4% went to 3% share wallet. So we balance all those things, the affordability, the balance sheet and make this come together. So again, I feel really confident about our glide path forward. And Rejji, might have some comments on that as well. Well, this is the best plan for Michigan. One of the things that our first IRP taught us is that -- we learned a lot from that. And this is, I would just say, a great plan, remarkable plan for all the reasons I mentioned a few minutes ago. And so there's a win in here for everyone. And when there's a win, there's an opportunity to reach settlement or go the whole distance. And so again, I would just reference 2018. We were very successful with a number of interveners and being able to get to a settlement. But that's what's great about this regulatory construct. We're working with these interveners in the process. And if there's an opportunity to settle where there's an outcome that is good for all, we will do that. And so we're early on into -- and again, I'm very optimistic we have a great plan. And I don't know Rejji, do you want to add to that? Yes, I'm going to add to that. I just want to be just crystal clear on this, not only affordability piece, but those natural gas plants are required for resiliency in the state. You can't get here from there. That's just bottom line. And so it's that crystal clear. And that's why I have just a high degree of confidence. Hey Anthony. Well, you said pretty confident. I would change that word to really confident. And so there's a little bit [indiscernible] your question. But I'm equally confident in our dividend piece. And what you heard from me is that confidence in dividend growth for 2022, we recognize the importance of it, and we have it built into our financial plan. I really want to hand it over to Rejji here because there is an important piece that's associated with the sale of the bank and closure in Q4 that also shapes that dividend. And so that's why we're -- most pieces have to come together so that we can share that potential here at the end of the year. But go ahead, Rejji. And just add to that. There's -- with the sale and that closure there, there's upside potential there from a dividend perspective, again. So we want to be able to -- our investors to be able to share some of that positive news. I don't know about most challenging. I think that's -- I'll just tell you this, Anthony. Back in 2014 and 2015, I was a policy witness. I've been on the stand with interveners been crossed by attorneys. They go after a lot of different things in the case. And here's -- again, we've got strong testimony. We got great precedent. We're used to this stuff. We do this all the time with our rate cases. We've done it with a previous IRP. I don't think there's anything this team can't handle, frankly. And so -- and we're prepared to do that. As Rejji alluded to a minute ago, there's a lot of detail, a lot of modeling and data that went into this. And so it's a very strong case. Good morning. Well, I do feel comfortable with it. There's a precedent set in Colorado, Florida, Wisconsin for a similar approach in Michigan. We do have a nice ability to securitize, but it is voluntary, and that's an important piece of this. And so it's essentially -- in 2025, it's about $1.2 billion of remaining book value, to going through and securitize that just doesn't make sense. This is going to be a drag in credit metrics. They have an impact on cost of capital, which ultimately shows up on the customers' bill. That's -- I mean, that doesn't make sense. And so we've really got a good approach there. It's different than how we've approached it previously. But again, there's a nice precedent that's been set, and I'm really -- the testimony -- I've reviewed the testimony, it's -- we're in a good spot. Thank you. I think Rejji and I will tag team this one. And so let me just kind of frame up when I think about our capital plans. And I think we'll talk about our current work across our utility but also this IRP. And so at the end of the year, in our January call, we're going to add another year to that five-year capital plan, and that's going to be more capital opportunity. That five-year plan is going to grow. And it's going to be in our gas business, it's going to be in our electric distribution business. And so there's some growth opportunity there. Then we'll continue to follow this IRP through the process through that 10-month process. Again, we feel confident in the outcome of that. And then that's an incremental 1.3. And so you can imagine in Q2 of 2022, we're going to -- with a successful outcome, there will be an adjustment in 2023 to accommodate the Covert facility. And then also an adjustment in 2025. And so you can see some of that play out over the five years and into the 10-year because when you look at this integrated resource plan, it goes from \u201825 to \u201827. And so some of that still will be able to fall in the 10-year piece as well. And so there's some update that will take place along those lines. So that's kind of the capital layout. But, Rejji, certainly, tag team this with me. I'm going to have Rejji start with some of the specifics and then I'll talk about some macro at the end. So Rejji, why don't you grab it? I'll just add to that, just a little bit of clarification. So those new service connections -- interconnections, those are installs. Those aren't someone dreaming of a house or thinking about a business. Those are actually in the ground. And so again, it gives you some idea of the momentum here. We continue to have unemployment rates well below the national average here in Michigan in the heart of our service territory. Grand Rapids, it's even better. And just to give you a little flavor over the quarter, we've even seen growth in, again, macro trends and people opening new business in Michigan. In fact, we're under an NDA right now with the company. But it's $300 million investment, 30 megawatts, 150 jobs that are locating here in our service territory in Michigan. And I could [indiscernible] two other examples of that. And so coming out of the pandemic here, and we're seeing a nice economic development growth here in Michigan as well. Thank you. Good. We're doing great Paul. Yes. The remaining book value in 2025 of the those coal plants would be $1.2 billion. That is another consideration in this filing. I do follow what you're saying. And so we look at -- across that 5-year plan of investments we look at the rate impact and two, the bill impact, which is also critically important for our residential and commercial customers. And so that is part of the five year. And as we -- again, this incremental capital of $1.3 billion, it provides $650 million of savings over our current plan. And so this is -- so again, this comes together nicely to your point, Paul, from an affordability perspective for our customers. Yes. Thank you Paul. Well again I want to thank everyone for joining us today. Again strong quarter, great first half of the year and upward momentum and just again I'm looking forward to seeing everyone in person here as we again faithfully as we move through the latter half of the year. Take care and be safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 6. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Rocco. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CMS Energy. Over the past five months, I have been on the virtual road and have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to share our investment thesis, which delivers for all our stakeholders. This thesis is grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit and enables the excellence you have come to expect from CMS Energy. Many of you have asked what will change under my leadership. And I want to reemphasize, we've changed leadership not the simple proven investment thesis that delivers year in and year out. Looking forward, we are committed to leading the clean energy transformation with our net-zero carbon and methane emissions plans, which are supported by our clean energy investments in our current progressive integrated resource plan. Furthermore, we are recognized as top-tier for ESG performance earning top ratings amongst our peers. We continue to mature our industry-leading lean operating system, the CE Way, eliminating waste and improving our performance. I love this system. Over the past several years, we have used it across the business to drive efficiencies, improve employee engagement and deliver sustainable cost performance. I've seen it, I've worked it, and we have plenty of gas pedal left. Today, we are crafting the next horizon, what I call CE Way 2.0, which layers in greater use of automation and analytics and begins to position CMS Energy, as a leader in digital. Another key differentiator of CMS Energy is Michigan's top-tier regulatory construct that has 10-month forward-looking rate cases in constructive ROEs. This all leads to our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. At CMS Energy, we wake up every day to get after it, deliver for our customers in all conditions, rain, snow, sleet wind. We never quit. And for you, our investors, we never quit. This year is no different. Now, let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.21 of adjusted earnings per share. This is up significantly, $0.35 from last year, primarily from incremental revenue to fund needed customer investments and sustained cost performance. As a reminder, our full-year dividend is $1.74, up 7% from last year. We are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for the year of $2.83 to $2.87 of adjusted earnings per share and our long-term earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8% with the bias to the midpoint. At CMS Energy, we are committed to our promises to our co-workers, the communities we serve, and our planet, as we are to delivering our financial commitments. During my discussions with many of you, the topic of ESG often comes up. I'm proud of our leadership in this space. We continue to enhance our commitments and our efforts are being recognized with top-tier ratings. We remain a AA-rated company by MSCI and have ranked top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics since 2013. This is a deep commitment that began well before it was a trend. Our commitments to net-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 are among the most aggressive in the industry. As our industry approach is a cleaner energy future, and we retire our legacy generating units, it is critical that we honor the contributions and service of our co-workers, as well as address the economic impact on those communities. Now, I began my career on the generation side of our business. I have walked the halls, climbed the stairs of every one of our generating plants, shaking hands, drink coffee with the men and women, who work every day to provide energy for our customers. And I'm proud of the honorable and equitable way we have cared for both our co-workers and our communities, as we retire these units from service. We built a playbook for success. It began with the retirement of our seven coal plants in 2016. That work will continue with the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our leadership and track record in this space is something I'm proud of and we will continue as we look to the future. This ensures success for all stakeholders, including our investors. While many focus on the E of ESG, we have a strong record of delivering across all three. In my 20 years of service, I believe our culture has never been stronger. Every single day, our co-worker show up with a heart of service for our customers, our communities, and ultimately you, our investors. Our culture anchored by our values is thriving across our company and it's why we are recognized for top quartile safety performance, industry-leading employee engagement, Forbes Best Employer for Women, Best for Vets by Military Times and Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the Corporate Equality Index. And earlier this month, we were ranked by Forbes, as the number one utility in the country, as Best Employers for Diversity. Our leadership, commitment and top-tier ESG performance should provide you with the confidence that our long track record will continue to deliver value for customers and investors. Turning to recent updates. I want to highlight our continued growth in renewables with several exciting announcements. We are pleased to announce the recent commission approval of our Heartland Wind Project in March, which will be online in December of next year. This project adds 201 megawatts of new capacity, as a part of our renewable portfolio standard earning a 10.7% return. I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for the first tranche of our current Integrated Resource Plan, which adds nearly 300 megawatts of new solar through two projects that we expect to come online in 2022. We are evaluating the second tranche of our current IRP, another 300 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2023. In the third tranche, 500 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2024 for a total of 1,100 megawatts. We are on track to file our next Integrated Resource Plan in June. It has been a popular topic in our meetings with many of you, while we are still finalizing the details, the focus of our upcoming IRP will be to accelerate the decarbonization of our fleet, ensure reliability and affordability and add renewable and demand side resources in a way that makes sense for our customers and investors, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. And I'm excited for this next IRP. It serves as yet another proof point that we are leading the clean energy transformation. As part of our clean energy transformation \u2013 part of our clean energy transformation includes retirement of our remaining coal fleet. On Slide 7, you will see our plan to decarbonize as both visible and data-driven. The meaningful reduction of carbon emissions in our plan will drive our ability to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Over the past few months, I've been asked quite a bit about the future of our gas business. As I've shared with many of you, our gas business and system is critical to providing affordable and reliable heating here in Michigan. But doesn't mean we're sitting on our tails here. In fact, we are actively working to decarbonize our gas system. Now this aligns very well with the recent announcement from the Biden administration. Our first step is to reduce fugitive methane emissions, which is well under way, as we accelerate the replacement of vintage mains and services, both plans approved by the commission will decrease our missions and achieve our net-zero methane goal. Our decarbonization plans also leverage energy efficiency to reduce carbon usage and put renewable natural gas on our system, which will help decarbonize most difficult sectors, such as agriculture. By replacing vintage mains and services with plastic piping, we will be positioned to deliver hydrogen or other clean molecules to our customers in the future. As we would grow our renewable portfolio and decarbonize our generation fleet and gas delivery system, we remain committed to delivering against the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. Before I turn the call over to Rejji, I want to end with this slide. It demonstrates our consistent industry-leading performance for nearly two decades. As much as things change, one thing stays consistent, year in and year out we have and we will continue to deliver. 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different, marking 19 years of consistent, predictable financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we are pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.35 above our Q1 2020 results, largely driven by rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility. Our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a one-time cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funding related costs respectively. This modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at EnerBank, which exceeded its Q1 2020 EPS contribution by $0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking toward the high end of our guidance for the year of $0.22 per share. The waterfall chart on Slide 10 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year-to-go drivers to meet our 2021 EPS guidance range. To elaborate on the year-to-date performance, while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to-date, which has led to lower volumetric gas sales, it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020. And the absence of that weather has led to $0.08 per share of positive variance period-over-period. From a rates perspective, given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses, we are seeing $0.26 per share of positive variance. As a reminder, our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs. It is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes, as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement. On the cost side as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization and in alignment with our recent rate orders. As you can see, we're $0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing sustained cost performance from 2020, as well as increased productivity in 2021, largely attributable to the CE Way. That said, we do expect to see the bulk of the planned O&M increases to materialize later in the year. The balance of our year-to-date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our non-utility segment and non-weather sales, which though slightly down at about 1% below the first quarter 2020 continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher margin residential class, up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And I'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the remaining nine months of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full-year EPS guidance. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.12 per share of negative variance given the above normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020. The residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief, which equates to $0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And the continued execution of our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate as an incremental $0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020. We have also assumed the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales and our non-utility segments. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining three quarters of 2021. And needless to say, we will be prepared to flex costs up or down as the fact pattern evolves over the course of the year. As we look out over the long-term, we are in the early stages of executing our $13.2 billion five-year customer investment plan at the utility, which is highlighted on Slide 11 and will provide significant benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our investors. As a reminder, we have budgeted over $2.5 billion of investments in 2021, the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety, reliability and clean energy projects. We are on track thus far, and recently filed an electric rate case in March that enumerate our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year, which are summarized on the right hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing. We expect an order from the commission by the end of the year. Despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years, as you know we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers, and we have the track record to prove it. The left hand side of Slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure, which we have successfully managed over the past several years, while investing significant capital on behalf of customers. In fact, from 2007 to 2019, we reduced utility bills, as a percentage of customer wallet by 1%, while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in the utility over that timeframe. As we look ahead, we have several highly actionable event-driven cost reduction opportunities, which will provide substantial savings in the years to come. The planned expiration of our Palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our MCV PPA will collectively generate roughly $150 million of power supply cost recovery savings. And as you'll note, our initial estimates for the potential savings for the MCV contract amendment of approximately $50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $60 million in savings per the commission's order in March. Also the planned retirements of our five remaining coal unit should provide another $90 million of savings in aggregate, exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings, which will create meaningful headroom and bills for future customer investments. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our annual O&M productivity delivered through the CE Way, which last year generated roughly $45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long-term and intra-year financial planning. To that end, many of you've asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan. Though at this point, the final details remain unclear, trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we will leverage the CE Way and other cost reduction opportunities, including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed, as part of the legislation to minimize the impact to customers, while executing our capital plan. As we've said before, it is our job to do the worrying for you, and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds. With our unparalleled track record on cost management, driven by our highly engaged workforce coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top-tier regulatory construct, we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious, operational, customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future. And with that, we'll move to Q&A. So Rocco, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning, guys.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Arnold: Good morning. Quick one to Garrick. I appreciate the comments on the IRP, and you mentioned the sort of focus will be on accelerating decarbonization. Are you willing to sort of talk about how significant an acceleration you might sort of have in mind? Could we be talking about bringing net-zero sort of into that 2035 timeframe on electric, for example?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, thanks for your question, Jonathan. We've laid out those objectives and all of those objectives, I would just put them all is equally important. And so decarbonization is one, but so is reliability and affordability and the rest of them that are listed there within the deck. You'll recall from the settlement we had on our current Integrated Resource Plan in 2019 that we were going to take a look at the potential for accelerating Campbell 1, 2, which is currently scheduled to retire in 2031. And so we're doing that as part of this evaluation. And I would just put it this way, we're in the final throes of completing exhibits and testimony. We'll be sharing the outcome with our Board of Directors like we do and some of our large filings in early May here. And I don't want to get too far ahead of our Board of Directors here. So our objectives are true. That's what we're targeting and we look forward to sharing more in the Q2 reports.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for that. And then, just on \u2013 may I ask on EnerBank? I mean, obviously, you've mentioned you're now tracking to the high end of the range, but it seemed to unusually sort of big number in the first quarter. Is there anything other than just strong origination going on there maybe Rejji?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. As you know \u2013 yes, Rejji chairs it. So Rejji, why don\u2019t you go ahead?\nRejji Hayes: Jonathan thanks for the question. I think you hit one of the bigger drivers, and so it's really a couple of things. You've got strong origination growth. And we really saw and we talked about this let's say in quarters two through four last year, a nice vacation bid with very good loan origination volume for swimming pools, HVAC systems, and that has carried on. So you've got strong origination growth. And you also I would say have a weak comp in Q1 of last year, just because, as you recall the pandemic really started to impact the global economy in the sort of latter part of March. And so Q1 of last year picked some of that up. We also do have a loan sale, as part of that earnings growth. Now, this is all unplanned. We had anticipated this in our 2021 plan, but that also offers the favorability relative to Q1 of 2020. And we've always talked about the fact that we don't allocate capital to the bank and so they have to fund their own growth. And so loan sales is certainly part of that strategy. So it's really a combination of strong origination growth coupled with the loan sale.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. I mean, can you maybe quantify how much that piece was and perhaps also talk about where that leaves the book in terms of size maybe relative to where it was?\nRejji Hayes: They gave about $0.06 of upside from my prepared remarks relative to Q1 of 2020, roughly half of that was due to the loan sale and about the other half for the origination growth. So about $0.02 for each or $0.02 to $0.03 for each. And I'd say the book still looks quite good. For competitive reasons, we don't talk about the annual origination volumes, but they are still around 3 billion of assets all-in.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. Thank you, Garrick. And I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just maybe if I'll start continuing on the EnerBank conversation there. I think Rejji, you just said that the strong origination growth from last year has continued. What's your latest thinking on when that might return to sort of a more normal level? In other words, the COVID trade will eventually moderate. There are only so many swimming pools to be installed.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So it's a good question, and we may not see the feverish volumes we saw in 2020, but we continue to see high applications and again, very good origination volume going into the second quarter. So I'm not convinced that that trend will abate any time soon. And it's not just swimming pool, they also do HVAC installation. That's a fairly non-cyclical product. And they also do resi solar and there is still good organic growth there as well. So there is decent diversification, Andrew, in the loan portfolio. Swimming pools certainly are quite strong. But again, we haven't seen any signs that, that will abate anytime soon. And if that does happen, let's say, in 2022 or beyond, we'll then at that point again, there is good HVAC volume, there is good resi solar, and they also do kitchen and windows and doors. So home improvement from our perspective is not going to be the sort of thing that's going to die out anytime soon. And we've been at this now for over a decade, and they\u2019ve delivered in a very non-cyclical way for some time now.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. And you mentioned it's trending to the high end for the full year. I mean, that kind of sounds like an understatement given that they earned $0.11 in the quarter alone. So what might be the limiting factor there as far as the \u2013 let me put it this way, is the balance sheet of CMS a limiting factor? Or are there other ways that you might slow down the growth rate to elongate the trajectory?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So let me be clear. So even though they delivered $0.11 of EPS contribution for the quarter and that was a strong beat versus Q1 of 2020 that was on plan. They were about a penny ahead of plan. So we assumed about $0.10 in a pretty front end loaded earnings trajectory in 2021. And so we do still see them kind of being within the range of $0.20 to $0.22. I wouldn't say it's due to actively potentially slowing them down. It's just part of the plan. There is a little bit of seasonality of the business. We'll see how it trends over time. But like the rest of the business, we'll manage it, where we try to avoid should rise, and if there are opportunities to derisk 2022 and beyond by some levers we pull at the bank as well as the other business, we\u2019ll look to do that.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. And then just more broadly, when you think about the CE Way, obviously, you had a really strong year last year with cost savings, strong start to the quarter this year. Are you already in a reinvestment mode to benefit customers and position yourselves well for next year and beyond? Or is it just too early given your typical uncertainty around summer weather?\nGarrick Rochow: I'll tell you the CE Way is alive and well, and we continue to work that system. As I shared in my comments, I do truly love that system and what it means for not only cost management, but what it means for improved customer service and co-worker engagement and employment \u2013 not employment, empowerment. So we work it all the time because it really provides some nice value for our customers in addition to cost management. So that's well under way. But to get to the heart of your question, we're early in the first part of the year here. We feel good about the quarter and we'll continue, as you know, Andrew, when there\u2019s opportunities. Should they show themselves, we'll reinvest for the benefit of our customers and for our shareholders here to really derisk the future years.\nAndrew Weisel: All right. Sounds good. Looking forward to the IRP.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Hi, thanks. I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on how energy transition could impact the upcoming IRP especially with the focus on hydrogen and expanded tax credits, such as 45Qs enhancing CCS economics. But what type of timeframe do you think this could make sense for CMS? Could it find its way into you plans or do you think they can find the way into your plans?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, we\u2019ve been talking about it in a bigger way than just energy transition. We call it the energy transformation. And certainly, what we're leading here. And it shows up on our first and our current and I would say, a progressive Integrated Resource Plan, the one that we're building out right now, just a ton of solar 1,100 megawatts of solar, the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 and energy efficiency and demand response programs that are outstanding offerings for our customers. But with any Integrated Resource Plan, particularly when you get to the end years of that plan there is about a 10% to 20% gap that you got to close. And that's not unique to CMS, you'll hear our peers talk about that as well. But I'll remind you, we're one of the most aggressive plans out there in decarbonization by 2040. So there does need to be technology advancements that comes in carbon capture, that comes in hydrogen, that comes in terms of lithium-ion both from a reliability, as well as affordability perspective. And so all of the above is needed. And so, in fact, we're \u2013 just even tomorrow, I'm going to be with \u2013 on a call with the Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget tomorrow to again, we're advocating for R&D type funding to continue to close that gap particularly in the out years. And so we'll participate, as it makes sense within the regulated utility to close some of those gaps. But again, they are out in the 2035, 2040 timeframe. And then, Rejji, you might have something more to add on that as well.\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, the only part I would add to Garrick's comments is just around the tax incentives. I mean it's obviously early days, but we've been encouraged with some of the proposals we've seen offered particularly in the widened bill with tax potential incentives applied on a technical basis for zero carbon emitting resources as well as potential flexibility on choosing PTCs versus ITCs and then more refundability, which is really one of the biggest constraints for utilities to execute on some of these renewable projects. And so if we see good advancements there that obviously allows us to do more front of the media solutions in a cost effective basis for customers. So that's encouraging, but obviously early days there.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just wondering if you could kind of frame your thoughts for us when it comes to the proven versus maybe the less proven technologies, targets as far as how much could be directly owned by CMS versus PPAs, just kind of any framework you could share with us there?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, let me offer this from a proven perspective. One of the things that we're considering within this next IRP is reliability. And so we look at loss of load expectations. And again, particularly in the backdrop of the unfortunate events in Texas, we're going to make sure that our system is reliable in every weather condition. We've got a history of that, and we'll continue to do that. And so clearly we're going to go with items that are proven that doesn't mean, we're not looking out forward and looking at R&D. But when it comes to putting equipment on the grid, we want to ensure reliability. But Rejji, I don\u2019t know, you may want to add more to that \u2013 to the question there, but I'll just give you a little bit of context.\nRejji Hayes: I'd be happy to. So as Garrick mentioned, Jeremy, in his prepared remarks, we did recently get approval from the commission on our first tranche of new solar attributable to the Integrated Resource Plan, the current Integrated Resource Plan. And we were, I'd say pleased with the average cost we saw over the life of the projects when we looked at the owned opportunity versus the contracted. And so on a levelized cost of energy basis, we saw kind of high $50 per megawatt hour for the own solution and kind of low $50 per megawatt hour for the contracted solution. And so then that excludes kind of residual value and other sort of operational benefits and savings that the owned portion could offer over time. And so we do think that longer term, there could be good opportunities, as we think through the new solar build out to potentially own more. But again, it's early days in the context of the IRP, I mean, we're thinking about six gigawatts over the next several couple of decades. So more to come on that. But the first tranche look pretty encouraging.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. So is it fair to say there could be CapEx upside in IRP here based on what you're talking about there?\nGarrick Rochow: Jeremy, we got $25 billion in the 10 years and $3 billion to $4 billion of opportunity out there and a long, long, long track record of organic needed customer investments in the state, renewables, electric and gas to decarbonize. And so again, you know our history here, there's just lots of opportunities here at CMS Energy.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Just one last one, if I could, with COVID and reopening. Just wondering if you could comment a bit on load trends in service territory and degree of residential stickiness that you have seen and could expect to see over the balance of the year?\nGarrick Rochow: I'm going to turn it over to Rejji first, and then, I'll come back to some larger COVID and state-type topics. So Rejji why don't you start?\nRejji Hayes: Sure. Jeremy, a pretty good trend over the course of the first quarter and I'm sure, you saw in some of the materials we rolled out this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, residential up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And so there still continues to be a little bit of stickiness in residential, which is higher margin, as we've talked about in the past. Commercial down 4%, still not quite at the pre-pandemic levels. But I think that has a bit to do with the resurgence that we've seen in terms of case counts in Michigan. And we do expect over the course of the year both commercial and industrial, which was down about 2% will be at pre-pandemic levels around mid-year. We're also encouraged with what we've seen for most of April in our smart meter data, particularly for the residential segment, which is up 4% ahead of plan. And so again, the trends look quite good. And we're also seeing just good economic trends in general. And I'll defer to Garrick on some of these details, but I still account to the fact that we've seen the residential class up about 1% versus the same period in 2020, we've seen commercial down \u2013 excuse me, a little less than 0.5%. So seeing good count volumes. And I'll have Garrick talk about the interconnection volumes we've seen, but it's been robust to say the least. So Garrick, I'll give it back to you.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Broadly from a Michigan perspective and I was with the Governor this week and as we've seen the COVID and its B117 variant. The number of hospitalizations decline, the number of positive cases declined, vaccinations continuing to increase, so I'd be surprised if there was an announcement here in the next couple of days that opens up more of Michigan, as we move forward, which will help from a commercial perspective. But just look at unemployment we're better than the U.S. right now across Michigan. And if you go into the heart of our electric service territory, Grand Rapids is even better. And we're seeing it too, and not just in unemployment numbers, but new service connects. The number of requested \u2013 well first of all, 2020 was a record year for new service connects in the midst of a pandemic. And the first, Q1 is up 27% over last year over the same time period. That's not just an initiation. That's actually initiation and constructed. So initiated and built, up 27%. And so again, we see a number of positive indicators. I could go on and on about this. Life sciences were up. Food processing is up. There is a great opportunity of growth we're seeing. And I believe it's going to continue to pick up, as we open up more and more of the state.\nJeremy Tonet: That's super helpful. That's it from me. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Weinstein: Hey, good morning, guys. Hey \u2013 in terms of a potential for a higher corporate tax rate, could you talk about the potential impact that would have on you and your \u2013 and the NOLs that you have through 2024 I think on Slide 25. And then also on the same line, if you have a higher tax rate, does that incur and let's say tax credit extension for renewables, does that \u2013 does one offset the other? Does this encourage you and regulators to build \u2013 to accelerate the build out of renewables in order to keep taxes down?\nGarrick Rochow: Let me offer a few comments on this, and then, I'll turn it over to Rejji as well. And so, you're getting really to the affordability and the headroom question, and as Rejji mentioned earlier with the widened proposal, there's a few others out there we're following closely and we're advocating frankly with EEI in Washington. This could be a real tailwind here. I mean, we already have a very aggressive solar build out in our current IRP and these renewable credits and Rejji went through some of the benefits and specifics of the widened proposal, but they can provide a nice tailwind, a nice savings opportunity for our customers. And so I get excited about that. And many of the glass is half full for me, but I think there's some real opportunities there. And to the degree, I'll just keep this in mind, to the degree there are any headwinds or tax implications for our customers remember this, if there is one company that I'm going to bet on, it's going to be CMS Energy. I mean we\u2019ve this proven track record of delivering year-after-year from a cost management perspective, and so through the CE Way and the like. And then, as Rejji indicated, these event-driven cost reductions, MCV, Palisades, coal plant retirements, I remain optimistic on our ability to manage it. It's still early. There are still proposals on the table. And I'm confident in our ability to manage it on behalf of our customers and keep bills affordable. But Rejji, you may have more to add.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Michael, what I would just add to all of Garrick's good comment as I too am encouraged, as I mentioned before on what we're seeing in incentives. Now to get directly to your question on NOLs, so like we saw when tax reform is enacted in 2017, there was a remeasurement of NOLs and that led to a non-cash loss, and a pretty significant one. Just with the tax rate going from 35% down to 21%. So if you see it come back, let's say, to 28% you have a favorable remeasurement. Clearly, we would carve that out like we did, but that could be beneficial because it creates a greater tax shield. We'd also see some benefit at our parent and other segment, which as you likely know is primarily interest expense and so you see just a greater value in that tax shield as well. Now, to your question about whether there is a push for more renewable build given incentives to offset the rate increases, we'll hold off on our speculation around that 3-dimensional chess, but certainly, in one of the comments we offered earlier, we do think there will be certainly potential attractive incentives and that should offset some of the rate increase implication if the deferral tax rate increase above 21%.\nMichael Weinstein: All right. Okay. You can see what I'm getting at. I mean, the higher \u2013 the Federal Government is giving away tax credits, at the same time they are raising taxes, it would seem that state regulators would want you to build more, just standard reason I guess. Anyway, that's all I have. Thanks.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning team. Thanks for the time and the opportunity. So if I can keep ripping off perhaps a couple of the other questions here, in brief, now we\u2019re getting late. With respect to be widened plan or what have you in terms of infrastructure. How do you think; one, about the different scenarios that you come out with on the IRP and two, probably more critically, is there any risk of delay in timeline based on the timeline of credits. I was just curious as to how you're thinking about the different scenarios and impacts here given \u2013 well, I'll leave it open then for you guys.\nGarrick Rochow: There's a lot of proposal \u2013 tax proposal on the table and we don't see them getting \u2013 being settled here in the next several months. We're on track to file our IRP in June and it will meet those objectives or really aimed at those objectives that are laid out there in the presentation and so it will be a plan that\u2019s good for Michigan and good for our planet and matches our triple-bottom line.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All right, fair enough, but it doesn't seem as that you're going to necessarily tailor any of the specific bulls around any of the proposed infrastructure efforts that could shift the planning through the IRP cycle or a process, right?\nGarrick Rochow: It's just too early. We're going to \u2013 I mean, we've done all the modeling, we're finalizing the details. We've got a good plan, we'll take it to the Board of Directors as we normally do but these proposals are going to move \u2013 probably going to move a lot this summer as well and so there are a bit unpredictable. I mean there's a lot of positives we see, but they are a bit unpredictable on where they land and Rejji you may have some other thoughts too.\nRejji Hayes: Julien, the only thing I would add to Garrick's good comment is that it's important to remember that the legislation and how it's structured in the nature of the IRP process is pretty multifaceted and takes into account the dynamism of the world and so we look at the business usual \u2013 business as usual case, we look at a descent and the emerging technologies, we will look at environmental policy changes and then we have various variables that low price, low growth, gas prices, et cetera. And so, there are hundreds of permutations as we structure the IRP and we do take into account a number of different scenarios and we do try to choose what's best from a triple-bottom line perspective, when you put it all through that regime at it. And so I'd say there is a lot of dynamism what's taking place now, I do think it's to some extent accounted for. But we know that we'll file another one in a few years if the world changes. And so that's the other benefit of this process is that it's very iterative as well.\nGarrick Rochow: If you just boil this down, Julien, I think to the degree there is a renewable tax and again, we like the technology neutral, what it does is it makes it cheaper, right. And so that is the tailwind. That's the opportunity and so will file a great IRP. I know this and it's just going to make it cheaper and less expensive for our customers, which is a good thing.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Great. Best of luck. Will speak to you after. All right.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Travis.\nTravis Miller: Good morning everyone. Thank you. I was wondering, we've seen a couple of states here just recently suggest potentially securitization options for coal plant retirements and accelerating that, what's your thought around that and we had discussion with Michigan politicians, regulators around that? Just want your thoughts?\nGarrick Rochow: I mean we have worked securitization here for a long time in Michigan. In fact, as part of the law here in Michigan and requires a 90-day. It is a 90-day process. We just completed one in December for Karn 1 and 2, many states many jurisdictions do not have this. We've got a good process under way that exists. Now, it does just in full transparency, there is one of the challenges with coal plants out there as they have a remaining book value, and so if you continue to securitize those that can have an impact on credit metrics and so, as I shared in our IRP objective that's one of the things that we are watching and needs \u2013 and we need to be thoughtful about as we pursue decarbonization in our clean energy goals.\nTravis Miller: Fair enough, I appreciate that. That's all I had, you answered my other questions. I appreciate the time.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thank you, Travis.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey. Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning.\nAnthony Crowdell: I have a quick question. Mostly been answered and it's follow-up of an earlier question on decarbonization and you kind of touched briefly on maybe the events in Texas. But have you noticed any pause in the policyholders or any of the parties that you're involved with during an IRP process of may be slowing down a decarbonization due to reliability. I know you touched on reliability earlier. But have you noticed any change following the Texas storms and maybe there is more of interest in keeping fossil generation around a little longer?\nGarrick Rochow: As I shared earlier our Integrated Resource Plan. I'm getting way into the engineering leads with you here as a loss of load expectation. And so that's one of the criteria that we're going to make sure that we deliver on. And so that reliability can come in a variety of different ways. And so \u2013 but we saw for reliability and so, again we want to make sure, what we present to the commission, to the staff up there, to all our intervenors that it has to \u2013 and when I talk about with our co-workers, when I talk about in the community and when I talk about in lancing and has to be affordable and has to be reliable and has to be clean and so we have to do all three, that's the challenge. And so again, we've got a great plan and you'll hear more about in Q2.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Stephen.\nLaura Sanchez: Hi, good morning. This is Laura calling for Stephen. On the energy transformation front and I'm sorry if this is repetitive, but I think the question is a little bit different, beyond potentially accelerating the retirement of the council units, how much more can you do without compromising the reliability of the grid, I'm wondering if there are gas plants that you can retire early without compromising the reliability of the grid and without assuming new technologies pick up? Basically how much is affordability versus reliability?\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Laura. How are you? Good to have you on the call. \nLaura Sanchez: Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: That's what that loss of load expectations study looks at. Again, we're going to model out energy and energy supply for 20 years, we're going to make sure we look at what the reliability looks like across the system to make sure the most affordable plan for our customers to make sure it's clean and then from an investor standpoint, we're going to make sure that; one, there is a nice opportunity for growth, own growth within the state of the needed customer investments as well as going to make sure a healthy balance sheet. So that's the entire balance, and so that's what the model solves for, so the question you're asking is what is exactly what the model is solving for what is that right balance point where everything comes together, and so we'll share more of what that looks like and all that mix here in Q2.\nLaura Sanchez: Understood. And lastly, if I may, could you comment a little bit on your current efforts on RNG? And if there are any voluntary programs altered or that will be offered in your gas utility?\nGarrick Rochow: So there is a small amount of RNG on our system, as we speak. To obtain net zero methane by 2030 we will have to put a bit more RNG on our system. I say a bit, let me quantify that. We move about 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas on our system on an annual basis. We\u2019ll have to put by about 0.3, yes, I said 0.3 billion cubic feet so that will help us get to net zero along with some thoughtful and deliberate investments in replacing old mains and services. So there\u2019ll be more added as we move forward. Now as we again, continue to think about our carbon footprint, there is the potential to add more renewable natural gas across our system. We'll do that in a thoughtful and deliberate way that's affordable for our customers and is considered out the planet. Now to your specific question on a program; we do not have a specific renewable natural gas program for our customers. We intend to add one over the course of this year. And so we'll be making a filing in 2021 that offers a program for our customers in this space.\nLaura Sanchez: Sounds good. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Garrick Rochow for any final remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rocco. And I like to thank you all, again for joining us today. I'm looking forward to when we can meet face-to-face hopefully soon and we can do that safely before the year is over. Take care and be safe.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference. We thank everyone for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we are pleased to report our first quarter results for 2021. In summary, we delivered adjusted net income of $348 million or $1.21 per share. For comparative purposes, our first quarter adjusted EPS was $0.35 above our Q1 2020 results, largely driven by rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, better weather and sustained cost performance from our 2020 efforts at the utility. Our enterprises and parent and other segments were slightly down as planned due to the absence of a one-time cost reduction item in 2020 and higher funding related costs respectively. This modest negative variance was more than offset by strong origination growth at EnerBank, which exceeded its Q1 2020 EPS contribution by $0.06 in 2021 as planned and is tracking toward the high end of our guidance for the year of $0.22 per share. The waterfall chart on Slide 10 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2020 and highlights our latest estimates for the major year-to-go drivers to meet our 2021 EPS guidance range. To elaborate on the year-to-date performance, while weather in the first quarter of 2020 has been below normal to-date, which has led to lower volumetric gas sales, it has been better than the historically warm winter weather experienced in the first quarter of 2020. And the absence of that weather has led to $0.08 per share of positive variance period-over-period. From a rates perspective, given the constructive regulatory outcomes achieved in the second half of 2020 for our electric and gas businesses, we are seeing $0.26 per share of positive variance. As a reminder, our rate relief estimates are stated net of investment-related costs, such as depreciation and amortization, property taxes and funding costs. It is also worth noting that our 2021 financials reflect the accelerated amortization of deferred taxes, as part of our 2020 gas rate order settlement. On the cost side as noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, we budgeted substantial increases in our operating and maintenance expenses in 2021 versus the prior year to fund key initiatives around safety, reliability, customer experience and decarbonization and in alignment with our recent rate orders. As you can see, we're $0.02 per share above our spend rate in the first quarter of 2020 as planned, and I'm pleased to report that we are seeing sustained cost performance from 2020, as well as increased productivity in 2021, largely attributable to the CE Way. That said, we do expect to see the bulk of the planned O&M increases to materialize later in the year. The balance of our year-to-date performance is driven by the aforementioned drivers at our non-utility segment and non-weather sales, which though slightly down at about 1% below the first quarter 2020 continue to exhibit favorable mix with the higher margin residential class, up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And I'll remind you that our total electric sales exclude one large low margin customer. As we look ahead to the remaining nine months of 2021, we are cautiously optimistic about the glide path illustrated on this slide to achieve our full-year EPS guidance. As always, we plan for normal weather, which in this case translates to $0.12 per share of negative variance given the above normal weather experienced in the second and third quarters of 2020. The residual impact of the aforementioned rate relief, which equates to $0.22 per share of pickup and is not subject to any further MPSC actions. And the continued execution of our operational and customer-related projects, which we estimate as an incremental $0.18 per share of spend versus the comparable period in 2020. We have also assumed the usual conservatism in our utility non-weather sales and our non-utility segments. All in, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and are well positioned for the remaining three quarters of 2021. And needless to say, we will be prepared to flex costs up or down as the fact pattern evolves over the course of the year. As we look out over the long-term, we are in the early stages of executing our $13.2 billion five-year customer investment plan at the utility, which is highlighted on Slide 11 and will provide significant benefits for our customers, the communities we serve and our investors. As a reminder, we have budgeted over $2.5 billion of investments in 2021, the vast majority of which is earmarked for safety, reliability and clean energy projects. We are on track thus far, and recently filed an electric rate case in March that enumerate our customer investment priorities for the 2022 test year, which are summarized on the right hand side of the page among other key details related to the filing. We expect an order from the commission by the end of the year. Despite the substantial customer investments that we intend to make on our electric and gas system over the next several years, as you know we take great pride in taking out costs in a sustainable way to maintain affordable bills for our customers, and we have the track record to prove it. The left hand side of Slide 12 summarizes the key components of our cost structure, which we have successfully managed over the past several years, while investing significant capital on behalf of customers. In fact, from 2007 to 2019, we reduced utility bills, as a percentage of customer wallet by 1%, while investing roughly $19 billion of capital in the utility over that timeframe. As we look ahead, we have several highly actionable event-driven cost reduction opportunities, which will provide substantial savings in the years to come. The planned expiration of our Palisades power purchase agreement and the recently approved amendment to our MCV PPA will collectively generate roughly $150 million of power supply cost recovery savings. And as you'll note, our initial estimates for the potential savings for the MCV contract amendment of approximately $50 million proved conservative with the revised estimate of over $60 million in savings per the commission's order in March. Also the planned retirements of our five remaining coal unit should provide another $90 million of savings in aggregate, exclusive of any potential fuel cost savings, which will create meaningful headroom and bills for future customer investments. Lastly, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention our annual O&M productivity delivered through the CE Way, which last year generated roughly $45 million of savings and serves as a critical tool to our long-term and intra-year financial planning. To that end, many of you've asked about proposed changes in corporate tax policy and its potential impact to our plan. Though at this point, the final details remain unclear, trust that we are evaluating the potential effects and we will leverage the CE Way and other cost reduction opportunities, including potential offsetting tax credits that are also being proposed, as part of the legislation to minimize the impact to customers, while executing our capital plan. As we've said before, it is our job to do the worrying for you, and we are uniquely positioned over the next several years to manage any potential headwinds. With our unparalleled track record on cost management, driven by our highly engaged workforce coupled with a robust customer investment backlog and top-tier regulatory construct, we are confident that we can deliver on our ambitious, operational, customer and financial objectives for the foreseeable future. And with that, we'll move to Q&A. So Rocco, please open the lines. Jonathan thanks for the question. I think you hit one of the bigger drivers, and so it's really a couple of things. You've got strong origination growth. And we really saw and we talked about this let's say in quarters two through four last year, a nice vacation bid with very good loan origination volume for swimming pools, HVAC systems, and that has carried on. So you've got strong origination growth. And you also I would say have a weak comp in Q1 of last year, just because, as you recall the pandemic really started to impact the global economy in the sort of latter part of March. And so Q1 of last year picked some of that up. We also do have a loan sale, as part of that earnings growth. Now, this is all unplanned. We had anticipated this in our 2021 plan, but that also offers the favorability relative to Q1 of 2020. And we've always talked about the fact that we don't allocate capital to the bank and so they have to fund their own growth. And so loan sales is certainly part of that strategy. So it's really a combination of strong origination growth coupled with the loan sale. They gave about $0.06 of upside from my prepared remarks relative to Q1 of 2020, roughly half of that was due to the loan sale and about the other half for the origination growth. So about $0.02 for each or $0.02 to $0.03 for each. And I'd say the book still looks quite good. For competitive reasons, we don't talk about the annual origination volumes, but they are still around 3 billion of assets all-in. Yes. So it's a good question, and we may not see the feverish volumes we saw in 2020, but we continue to see high applications and again, very good origination volume going into the second quarter. So I'm not convinced that that trend will abate any time soon. And it's not just swimming pool, they also do HVAC installation. That's a fairly non-cyclical product. And they also do resi solar and there is still good organic growth there as well. So there is decent diversification, Andrew, in the loan portfolio. Swimming pools certainly are quite strong. But again, we haven't seen any signs that, that will abate anytime soon. And if that does happen, let's say, in 2022 or beyond, we'll then at that point again, there is good HVAC volume, there is good resi solar, and they also do kitchen and windows and doors. So home improvement from our perspective is not going to be the sort of thing that's going to die out anytime soon. And we've been at this now for over a decade, and they've delivered in a very non-cyclical way for some time now. Jeremy, the only part I would add to Garrick's comments is just around the tax incentives. I mean it's obviously early days, but we've been encouraged with some of the proposals we've seen offered particularly in the widened bill with tax potential incentives applied on a technical basis for zero carbon emitting resources as well as potential flexibility on choosing PTCs versus ITCs and then more refundability, which is really one of the biggest constraints for utilities to execute on some of these renewable projects. And so if we see good advancements there that obviously allows us to do more front of the media solutions in a cost effective basis for customers. So that's encouraging, but obviously early days there. I'd be happy to. So as Garrick mentioned, Jeremy, in his prepared remarks, we did recently get approval from the commission on our first tranche of new solar attributable to the Integrated Resource Plan, the current Integrated Resource Plan. And we were, I'd say pleased with the average cost we saw over the life of the projects when we looked at the owned opportunity versus the contracted. And so on a levelized cost of energy basis, we saw kind of high $50 per megawatt hour for the own solution and kind of low $50 per megawatt hour for the contracted solution. And so then that excludes kind of residual value and other sort of operational benefits and savings that the owned portion could offer over time. And so we do think that longer term, there could be good opportunities, as we think through the new solar build out to potentially own more. But again, it's early days in the context of the IRP, I mean, we're thinking about six gigawatts over the next several couple of decades. So more to come on that. But the first tranche look pretty encouraging. Sure. Jeremy, a pretty good trend over the course of the first quarter and I'm sure, you saw in some of the materials we rolled out this morning. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, residential up 2% versus Q1 of 2020. And so there still continues to be a little bit of stickiness in residential, which is higher margin, as we've talked about in the past. Commercial down 4%, still not quite at the pre-pandemic levels. But I think that has a bit to do with the resurgence that we've seen in terms of case counts in Michigan. And we do expect over the course of the year both commercial and industrial, which was down about 2% will be at pre-pandemic levels around mid-year. We're also encouraged with what we've seen for most of April in our smart meter data, particularly for the residential segment, which is up 4% ahead of plan. And so again, the trends look quite good. And we're also seeing just good economic trends in general. And I'll defer to Garrick on some of these details, but I still account to the fact that we've seen the residential class up about 1% versus the same period in 2020, we've seen commercial down \u2013 excuse me, a little less than 0.5%. So seeing good count volumes. And I'll have Garrick talk about the interconnection volumes we've seen, but it's been robust to say the least. So Garrick, I'll give it back to you. Yes. Michael, what I would just add to all of Garrick's good comment as I too am encouraged, as I mentioned before on what we're seeing in incentives. Now to get directly to your question on NOLs, so like we saw when tax reform is enacted in 2017, there was a remeasurement of NOLs and that led to a non-cash loss, and a pretty significant one. Just with the tax rate going from 35% down to 21%. So if you see it come back, let's say, to 28% you have a favorable remeasurement. Clearly, we would carve that out like we did, but that could be beneficial because it creates a greater tax shield. We'd also see some benefit at our parent and other segment, which as you likely know is primarily interest expense and so you see just a greater value in that tax shield as well. Now, to your question about whether there is a push for more renewable build given incentives to offset the rate increases, we'll hold off on our speculation around that 3-dimensional chess, but certainly, in one of the comments we offered earlier, we do think there will be certainly potential attractive incentives and that should offset some of the rate increase implication if the deferral tax rate increase above 21%. Thank you. Julien, the only thing I would add to Garrick's good comment is that it's important to remember that the legislation and how it's structured in the nature of the IRP process is pretty multifaceted and takes into account the dynamism of the world and so we look at the business usual \u2013 business as usual case, we look at a descent and the emerging technologies, we will look at environmental policy changes and then we have various variables that low price, low growth, gas prices, et cetera. And so, there are hundreds of permutations as we structure the IRP and we do take into account a number of different scenarios and we do try to choose what's best from a triple-bottom line perspective, when you put it all through that regime at it. And so I'd say there is a lot of dynamism what's taking place now, I do think it's to some extent accounted for. But we know that we'll file another one in a few years if the world changes. And so that's the other benefit of this process is that it's very iterative as well."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in CMS Energy. Over the past five months, I have been on the virtual road and have had the opportunity to meet with many of you to share our investment thesis, which delivers for all our stakeholders. This thesis is grounded in our commitment to the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit and enables the excellence you have come to expect from CMS Energy. Many of you have asked what will change under my leadership. And I want to reemphasize, we've changed leadership not the simple proven investment thesis that delivers year in and year out. Looking forward, we are committed to leading the clean energy transformation with our net-zero carbon and methane emissions plans, which are supported by our clean energy investments in our current progressive integrated resource plan. Furthermore, we are recognized as top-tier for ESG performance earning top ratings amongst our peers. We continue to mature our industry-leading lean operating system, the CE Way, eliminating waste and improving our performance. I love this system. Over the past several years, we have used it across the business to drive efficiencies, improve employee engagement and deliver sustainable cost performance. I've seen it, I've worked it, and we have plenty of gas pedal left. Today, we are crafting the next horizon, what I call CE Way 2.0, which layers in greater use of automation and analytics and begins to position CMS Energy, as a leader in digital. Another key differentiator of CMS Energy is Michigan's top-tier regulatory construct that has 10-month forward-looking rate cases in constructive ROEs. This all leads to our adjusted EPS growth of 6% to 8% and combined with our dividend, provides a premium total shareholder return of 9% to 11%. At CMS Energy, we wake up every day to get after it, deliver for our customers in all conditions, rain, snow, sleet wind. We never quit. And for you, our investors, we never quit. This year is no different. Now, let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we delivered $1.21 of adjusted earnings per share. This is up significantly, $0.35 from last year, primarily from incremental revenue to fund needed customer investments and sustained cost performance. As a reminder, our full-year dividend is $1.74, up 7% from last year. We are reaffirming our 2021 guidance for the year of $2.83 to $2.87 of adjusted earnings per share and our long-term earnings and dividend per share growth of 6% to 8% with the bias to the midpoint. At CMS Energy, we are committed to our promises to our co-workers, the communities we serve, and our planet, as we are to delivering our financial commitments. During my discussions with many of you, the topic of ESG often comes up. I'm proud of our leadership in this space. We continue to enhance our commitments and our efforts are being recognized with top-tier ratings. We remain a AA-rated company by MSCI and have ranked top quartile for global utilities by Sustainalytics since 2013. This is a deep commitment that began well before it was a trend. Our commitments to net-zero methane emissions by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2040 are among the most aggressive in the industry. As our industry approach is a cleaner energy future, and we retire our legacy generating units, it is critical that we honor the contributions and service of our co-workers, as well as address the economic impact on those communities. Now, I began my career on the generation side of our business. I have walked the halls, climbed the stairs of every one of our generating plants, shaking hands, drink coffee with the men and women, who work every day to provide energy for our customers. And I'm proud of the honorable and equitable way we have cared for both our co-workers and our communities, as we retire these units from service. We built a playbook for success. It began with the retirement of our seven coal plants in 2016. That work will continue with the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 in 2023. Our leadership and track record in this space is something I'm proud of and we will continue as we look to the future. This ensures success for all stakeholders, including our investors. While many focus on the E of ESG, we have a strong record of delivering across all three. In my 20 years of service, I believe our culture has never been stronger. Every single day, our co-worker show up with a heart of service for our customers, our communities, and ultimately you, our investors. Our culture anchored by our values is thriving across our company and it's why we are recognized for top quartile safety performance, industry-leading employee engagement, Forbes Best Employer for Women, Best for Vets by Military Times and Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality in the Corporate Equality Index. And earlier this month, we were ranked by Forbes, as the number one utility in the country, as Best Employers for Diversity. Our leadership, commitment and top-tier ESG performance should provide you with the confidence that our long track record will continue to deliver value for customers and investors. Turning to recent updates. I want to highlight our continued growth in renewables with several exciting announcements. We are pleased to announce the recent commission approval of our Heartland Wind Project in March, which will be online in December of next year. This project adds 201 megawatts of new capacity, as a part of our renewable portfolio standard earning a 10.7% return. I'm also pleased to share that we received approval for the first tranche of our current Integrated Resource Plan, which adds nearly 300 megawatts of new solar through two projects that we expect to come online in 2022. We are evaluating the second tranche of our current IRP, another 300 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2023. In the third tranche, 500 megawatts of solar expected to come online in 2024 for a total of 1,100 megawatts. We are on track to file our next Integrated Resource Plan in June. It has been a popular topic in our meetings with many of you, while we are still finalizing the details, the focus of our upcoming IRP will be to accelerate the decarbonization of our fleet, ensure reliability and affordability and add renewable and demand side resources in a way that makes sense for our customers and investors, while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. And I'm excited for this next IRP. It serves as yet another proof point that we are leading the clean energy transformation. As part of our clean energy transformation \u2013 part of our clean energy transformation includes retirement of our remaining coal fleet. On Slide 7, you will see our plan to decarbonize as both visible and data-driven. The meaningful reduction of carbon emissions in our plan will drive our ability to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2040. Over the past few months, I've been asked quite a bit about the future of our gas business. As I've shared with many of you, our gas business and system is critical to providing affordable and reliable heating here in Michigan. But doesn't mean we're sitting on our tails here. In fact, we are actively working to decarbonize our gas system. Now this aligns very well with the recent announcement from the Biden administration. Our first step is to reduce fugitive methane emissions, which is well under way, as we accelerate the replacement of vintage mains and services, both plans approved by the commission will decrease our missions and achieve our net-zero methane goal. Our decarbonization plans also leverage energy efficiency to reduce carbon usage and put renewable natural gas on our system, which will help decarbonize most difficult sectors, such as agriculture. By replacing vintage mains and services with plastic piping, we will be positioned to deliver hydrogen or other clean molecules to our customers in the future. As we would grow our renewable portfolio and decarbonize our generation fleet and gas delivery system, we remain committed to delivering against the triple bottom line of people, planet and profit. Before I turn the call over to Rejji, I want to end with this slide. It demonstrates our consistent industry-leading performance for nearly two decades. As much as things change, one thing stays consistent, year in and year out we have and we will continue to deliver. 2020 proved this. 2021 will be no different, marking 19 years of consistent, predictable financial performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Good morning, Jonathan. Well, thanks for your question, Jonathan. We've laid out those objectives and all of those objectives, I would just put them all is equally important. And so decarbonization is one, but so is reliability and affordability and the rest of them that are listed there within the deck. You'll recall from the settlement we had on our current Integrated Resource Plan in 2019 that we were going to take a look at the potential for accelerating Campbell 1, 2, which is currently scheduled to retire in 2031. And so we're doing that as part of this evaluation. And I would just put it this way, we're in the final throes of completing exhibits and testimony. We'll be sharing the outcome with our Board of Directors like we do and some of our large filings in early May here. And I don't want to get too far ahead of our Board of Directors here. So our objectives are true. That's what we're targeting and we look forward to sharing more in the Q2 reports. Yes. As you know \u2013 yes, Rejji chairs it. So Rejji, why don't you go ahead? Thank you. Hi, Andrew. Yes. So let me be clear. So even though they delivered $0.11 of EPS contribution for the quarter and that was a strong beat versus Q1 of 2020 that was on plan. They were about a penny ahead of plan. So we assumed about $0.10 in a pretty front end loaded earnings trajectory in 2021. And so we do still see them kind of being within the range of $0.20 to $0.22. I wouldn't say it's due to actively potentially slowing them down. It's just part of the plan. There is a little bit of seasonality of the business. We'll see how it trends over time. But like the rest of the business, we'll manage it, where we try to avoid should rise, and if there are opportunities to derisk 2022 and beyond by some levers we pull at the bank as well as the other business, we'll look to do that. I'll tell you the CE Way is alive and well, and we continue to work that system. As I shared in my comments, I do truly love that system and what it means for not only cost management, but what it means for improved customer service and co-worker engagement and employment \u2013 not employment, empowerment. So we work it all the time because it really provides some nice value for our customers in addition to cost management. So that's well under way. But to get to the heart of your question, we're early in the first part of the year here. We feel good about the quarter and we'll continue, as you know, Andrew, when there's opportunities. Should they show themselves, we'll reinvest for the benefit of our customers and for our shareholders here to really derisk the future years. Thank you. Good morning. Well, we've been talking about it in a bigger way than just energy transition. We call it the energy transformation. And certainly, what we're leading here. And it shows up on our first and our current and I would say, a progressive Integrated Resource Plan, the one that we're building out right now, just a ton of solar 1,100 megawatts of solar, the retirement of Karn 1 and 2 and energy efficiency and demand response programs that are outstanding offerings for our customers. But with any Integrated Resource Plan, particularly when you get to the end years of that plan there is about a 10% to 20% gap that you got to close. And that's not unique to CMS, you'll hear our peers talk about that as well. But I'll remind you, we're one of the most aggressive plans out there in decarbonization by 2040. So there does need to be technology advancements that comes in carbon capture, that comes in hydrogen, that comes in terms of lithium-ion both from a reliability, as well as affordability perspective. And so all of the above is needed. And so, in fact, we're \u2013 just even tomorrow, I'm going to be with \u2013 on a call with the Department of Energy and Office of Management and Budget tomorrow to again, we're advocating for R&D type funding to continue to close that gap particularly in the out years. And so we'll participate, as it makes sense within the regulated utility to close some of those gaps. But again, they are out in the 2035, 2040 timeframe. And then, Rejji, you might have something more to add on that as well. Well, let me offer this from a proven perspective. One of the things that we're considering within this next IRP is reliability. And so we look at loss of load expectations. And again, particularly in the backdrop of the unfortunate events in Texas, we're going to make sure that our system is reliable in every weather condition. We've got a history of that, and we'll continue to do that. And so clearly we're going to go with items that are proven that doesn't mean, we're not looking out forward and looking at R&D. But when it comes to putting equipment on the grid, we want to ensure reliability. But Rejji, I don't know, you may want to add more to that \u2013 to the question there, but I'll just give you a little bit of context. Jeremy, we got $25 billion in the 10 years and $3 billion to $4 billion of opportunity out there and a long, long, long track record of organic needed customer investments in the state, renewables, electric and gas to decarbonize. And so again, you know our history here, there's just lots of opportunities here at CMS Energy. I'm going to turn it over to Rejji first, and then, I'll come back to some larger COVID and state-type topics. So Rejji why don't you start? Yes. Broadly from a Michigan perspective and I was with the Governor this week and as we've seen the COVID and its B117 variant. The number of hospitalizations decline, the number of positive cases declined, vaccinations continuing to increase, so I'd be surprised if there was an announcement here in the next couple of days that opens up more of Michigan, as we move forward, which will help from a commercial perspective. But just look at unemployment we're better than the U.S. right now across Michigan. And if you go into the heart of our electric service territory, Grand Rapids is even better. And we're seeing it too, and not just in unemployment numbers, but new service connects. The number of requested \u2013 well first of all, 2020 was a record year for new service connects in the midst of a pandemic. And the first, Q1 is up 27% over last year over the same time period. That's not just an initiation. That's actually initiation and constructed. So initiated and built, up 27%. And so again, we see a number of positive indicators. I could go on and on about this. Life sciences were up. Food processing is up. There is a great opportunity of growth we're seeing. And I believe it's going to continue to pick up, as we open up more and more of the state. Good morning, Michael. Let me offer a few comments on this, and then, I'll turn it over to Rejji as well. And so, you're getting really to the affordability and the headroom question, and as Rejji mentioned earlier with the widened proposal, there's a few others out there we're following closely and we're advocating frankly with EEI in Washington. This could be a real tailwind here. I mean, we already have a very aggressive solar build out in our current IRP and these renewable credits and Rejji went through some of the benefits and specifics of the widened proposal, but they can provide a nice tailwind, a nice savings opportunity for our customers. And so I get excited about that. And many of the glass is half full for me, but I think there's some real opportunities there. And to the degree, I'll just keep this in mind, to the degree there are any headwinds or tax implications for our customers remember this, if there is one company that I'm going to bet on, it's going to be CMS Energy. I mean we've this proven track record of delivering year-after-year from a cost management perspective, and so through the CE Way and the like. And then, as Rejji indicated, these event-driven cost reductions, MCV, Palisades, coal plant retirements, I remain optimistic on our ability to manage it. It's still early. There are still proposals on the table. And I'm confident in our ability to manage it on behalf of our customers and keep bills affordable. But Rejji, you may have more to add. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, Julien. There's a lot of proposal \u2013 tax proposal on the table and we don't see them getting \u2013 being settled here in the next several months. We're on track to file our IRP in June and it will meet those objectives or really aimed at those objectives that are laid out there in the presentation and so it will be a plan that's good for Michigan and good for our planet and matches our triple-bottom line. It's just too early. We're going to \u2013 I mean, we've done all the modeling, we're finalizing the details. We've got a good plan, we'll take it to the Board of Directors as we normally do but these proposals are going to move \u2013 probably going to move a lot this summer as well and so there are a bit unpredictable. I mean there's a lot of positives we see, but they are a bit unpredictable on where they land and Rejji you may have some other thoughts too. If you just boil this down, Julien, I think to the degree there is a renewable tax and again, we like the technology neutral, what it does is it makes it cheaper, right. And so that is the tailwind. That's the opportunity and so will file a great IRP. I know this and it's just going to make it cheaper and less expensive for our customers, which is a good thing. Thanks, Julien. Good morning, Travis. I mean we have worked securitization here for a long time in Michigan. In fact, as part of the law here in Michigan and requires a 90-day. It is a 90-day process. We just completed one in December for Karn 1 and 2, many states many jurisdictions do not have this. We've got a good process under way that exists. Now, it does just in full transparency, there is one of the challenges with coal plants out there as they have a remaining book value, and so if you continue to securitize those that can have an impact on credit metrics and so, as I shared in our IRP objective that's one of the things that we are watching and needs \u2013 and we need to be thoughtful about as we pursue decarbonization in our clean energy goals. Yes. Thank you, Travis. Good morning. As I shared earlier our Integrated Resource Plan. I'm getting way into the engineering leads with you here as a loss of load expectation. And so that's one of the criteria that we're going to make sure that we deliver on. And so that reliability can come in a variety of different ways. And so \u2013 but we saw for reliability and so, again we want to make sure, what we present to the commission, to the staff up there, to all our intervenors that it has to \u2013 and when I talk about with our co-workers, when I talk about in the community and when I talk about in lancing and has to be affordable and has to be reliable and has to be clean and so we have to do all three, that's the challenge. And so again, we've got a great plan and you'll hear more about in Q2. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Stephen. Hi, Laura. How are you? Good to have you on the call. That's what that loss of load expectations study looks at. Again, we're going to model out energy and energy supply for 20 years, we're going to make sure we look at what the reliability looks like across the system to make sure the most affordable plan for our customers to make sure it's clean and then from an investor standpoint, we're going to make sure that; one, there is a nice opportunity for growth, own growth within the state of the needed customer investments as well as going to make sure a healthy balance sheet. So that's the entire balance, and so that's what the model solves for, so the question you're asking is what is exactly what the model is solving for what is that right balance point where everything comes together, and so we'll share more of what that looks like and all that mix here in Q2. So there is a small amount of RNG on our system, as we speak. To obtain net zero methane by 2030 we will have to put a bit more RNG on our system. I say a bit, let me quantify that. We move about 300 billion cubic feet of natural gas on our system on an annual basis. We'll have to put by about 0.3, yes, I said 0.3 billion cubic feet so that will help us get to net zero along with some thoughtful and deliberate investments in replacing old mains and services. So there'll be more added as we move forward. Now as we again, continue to think about our carbon footprint, there is the potential to add more renewable natural gas across our system. We'll do that in a thoughtful and deliberate way that's affordable for our customers and is considered out the planet. Now to your specific question on a program; we do not have a specific renewable natural gas program for our customers. We intend to add one over the course of this year. And so we'll be making a filing in 2021 that offers a program for our customers in this space. Thank you, Rocco. And I like to thank you all, again for joining us today. I'm looking forward to when we can meet face-to-face hopefully soon and we can do that safely before the year is over. Take care and be safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there'll be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 PM Eastern Time running through February 9th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations and Finance.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are, Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2022, an outstanding year at CMS Energy, both operationally and financially. And even more than that, 2022 marks the 20th year CMS Energy has consistently delivered industry-leading financial performance. Many of you have been on this journey with us. And I appreciate you and I thank you. You see us put our words into action. Our performance is supported by our simple investment thesis, which delivers for our customers and investors. We continue to lead the clean energy transformation. Our net zero commitments backed up by the solid plans in approved Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, provide certainty for investments in clean energy and highlight the supportive regulatory construct in Michigan. Across the company, we are disciplined about taking cost out and working every day to get better. We use the CE Way from corporate functions to the frontline to achieve our operational and financial objectives. This focus keeps customer bills affordable. On the regulatory front, it's been an incredible year. We sold not one, not two, but three major cases highlighting the top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. All of this leads to a premium total shareholder return you've come to expect from CMS Energy. I want to take a few minutes to share some of the big wins we had over the year. First, our commitment to people, our co-workers, who show up every day with the heart of service, and our customers who count on us to be there in any weather with safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy. In 2022, we were recognized nationwide as the Best Employer for Women in the Utility Sector, a Top Employer for Diversity and one of the Best Large Employers by Forbes, this team of co-workers, who continue to deliver results, utilizing the CE Way. In 2022, our co-workers commitment to being best-in-class in the operation of our generating assets saved our customers roughly $560 million. This is more than double what we delivered in 2021 mean our team continues to drive more value by running our own generation, more efficiently than the market. Just to make this real, in December, during the storm Elliott, when others were short power, this team and these generation assets were exporting energy out of Michigan into MISO. And I'm also pleased with the growth in economic development we've seen and helped lead in the state. As I shared in the Q3 call semiconductors, polysilicon and battery manufacturing, up all calling Michigan Home, 230 MW of new and expanding load with over $8 billion of investment in Michigan. A recent Department of Energy study ranks Michigan as a Top 3 state for planned battery plant capacity further differentiating our state and service territory. Our commitment across the state have delivered more load growth, more jobs and more investment, all of which create an environment. And our state looks strong well into the future. We remain focused on getting ready for that future with our IRP, which delivers even more savings to our customers with roughly $600 million in savings over our prior plan and reduces our carbon footprint by over 60% as we exit coal in 2025 amid 8 gigawatts of store and 550 megawatts of battery through 2040. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, and delivering $58 million of savings in 2022. This level of discipline to continuously improve has been a contributor to the successful regulatory outcomes in our settled electric and gas rate cases, which is highlighted by the $47 million of regulatory mechanisms to support infrastructure investments and assist customers. This year both our customers and investors will benefit from our $22 million voluntary refund mechanism, a $15 million bill credit and $10 million of customer assistance. These regulatory mechanisms de-risk 2023, while providing needed customer benefit. It's this strong execution in these results that you and we expect and meet our commitment to the triple bottom-line positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. 2022 marks another year of premium growth. The team continued to deliver regardless of conditions. In 2022, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 at the high-end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2023 adjusted full-year EPS guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 from $3.05 to $3.11 per share, compounding off of 2022 actuals like you would expect from a premium name like CMS Energy. We continue to expect to be toward the high-end of this range, which points to the midpoint or higher signaling are confident as we start the year in a strong position. Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $1.95 per share for 2023. Longer-term, we continue to have confidence toward the high-end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, and we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share we have refreshed our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by $1.2 billion to $15.5 billion through 2027. I have confidence in our plan for 2023 and beyond given our longstanding ability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth. It's no coincidence that I started my prepared remarks with our investment thesis. We live by it and it works. On Slide 6, we've highlighted our new five-year $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan. This translates to greater than 7% annual rate base growth in support safety and reliability investments in our electric and gas systems and paves the way to a clean-energy future when net zero carbon, methane and greenhouse gas emissions. You will note that about 40% of our customer investments support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gas system, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. Bottom line, we have a long and robust capital runway. Beyond our core investments, we have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. This includes adders built into legislation where incentives on our energy efficiency and demand response programs and the financial compensation mechanism, FCM we earn on PPAs. We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy as they see continued growth in their contracted renewables, as well as better pricing from capacity and energy sold at our DIG facility. We continue to earn a 10.7% ROE on renewables to meet our renewable portfolio standard and are in the process of completing Heartland Wind Project in 2023. These regulatory incentives are a core part of Michigan's energy law which with our strong regulatory construct continues to support needed customer investments. In addition, the Energy Law provides certainty of recovery before looking 10-month rate cases in regular fuel tracking mechanisms and allow us to help smooth the impact of commodity prices for our customers. I used the word incredible to describe this earlier. We delivered across the board the settlements in IRP and our gas and electric rate cases providing more certainty for 2023 customer investments. This wasn't by accident. We have a supportive law, strong regulatory construct and our improved regulatory approach enables us to work with multiple parties on complex cases and provide the best outcome for our customers and investors. And we plan to continue the strong performance in the next rate case cycle. We filed our gas case in December and we file our next electric rate case later this year with those outcomes providing further certainty for 2024 customer investments. We know a robust customer investment plan in strong regulatory construct loan do not support sustainable growth. Our customers count on us to keep their bills affordable. Inflation has been top of mind for many throughout 2022 and remains so as we enter 2023. First, I'll remind everyone that CMS Energy is well positioned as it relates to the key sources of inflation including labor, materials and commodities. In addition, we delivered roughly $150 million in CE Way savings over the last three years and estimate over $200 million in large, episodic savings as PPAs expire and as we exit coal generation. We're also seeing significant new and expanding commercial and industrial load in our service territory. There is a broad spectrum of growth. Some customers have opened new facilities this year and some are in early construction. These new sales opportunities, both in the short and long-term, allow us to spread our costs across a growing customer base, ultimately reducing rates for all of our customers. It should be no surprised why I'm pleased with 2022, and confident in the 2023 outlook. This proven approach continues to deliver. Now I'll pass the call over to Rejji, who will offer additional detail.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2022 with adjusted net income of $838 million, which translates to $2.89 per share at the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our full year 2022 financial performance were higher sales, driven by favorable weather and solid commercial and industrial load. The latter of which is indicative of the attractive economic conditions in our service territory and rate relief net of investments. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher expenses attributable to discrete customer initiatives, which reduce bills, support our most vulnerable customers and improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems. Our strong performance in 2022 provided significant financial flexibility at year end, which, as Garrick highlighted, enabled us to de-risk our 2023 financial plan to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022, on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enabled us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted-average price of over $68 per share. To address the parent company's financing need for the pending acquisition of the Covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023, and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11, as Garrick noted. We are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years and we also assume modest growth for non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the plant given the lack of financing needs in 2023, beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contracts for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case, amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022. Additionally, we anticipate $0.14 of EPS pickup attributable to the rate - attributable to rate relief, largely driven by our recent electric and gas rate orders and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year. As always, our rate relief, figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense. As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right hand side, we're assuming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and non-utility performance coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through a regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equates to $0.19 to $0.25 of positive variance versus 2022. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On Slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll limit my remarks to the metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing need until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our At The Market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027, given the substantial increase in our five-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a - perspective supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has been priced and or refunded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings address to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully de-risked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022 on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enable us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably, opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted average price of over $6 to $8 per share to address the parent company's financing needs for the pending acquisition of the covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023 and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11. As Garrick noted, we are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years, and we also assume modest growth for our nonutility business, North Star Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the parent given the lack of financing needs in 2023 beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contract for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022.

As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway. Lastly, the ultimate bar on the right-hand side were stemming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance, coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through our regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equate to $0.19 to $0.25 of positive variance versus 2022.

To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing needs until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027 and given the substantial increase in our 5-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a prospectus supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility a good portion of which has been priced and/or funded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings addressed to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully derisked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors. And as a reminder, the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility will enable us to exit coal generation in 2025 and which makes us one of the first vertically integrated utilities in the country to do so. To conclude my remarks on Slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse workforce remains engaged, well-trained and in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and has withstood the test of time. It delivers in a very balanced way for all our stakeholders and enables us to consistently deliver our financial objectives. 2022 was an outstanding year, marking our 20th year of industry-leading financial performance. I'm confident in our refresh $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan, the ability to execute on it and in our regulatory construct to support it as well as our solid track record of managing costs we keep customer bills affordable. Finally, we deliver regardless of conditions, not by luck, or accident, but by a great team who runs a proven model, who sees discipline in the work. This is what led to an outstanding 2022 and provides for a strong outlook in 2023 and beyond. With that, Adam, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Shahriar, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nShahriar Pourreza: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning. So just Garrick, couple of quick questions here. The CapEx update now includes Covert. Can you maybe comment on the impacts of IRA in the plan you presented today? The Clean Energy segment went from 2.8 to 3.1. So it was kind of a fairly modest increase. Were there sort of any assumption changes around tax equity utilization? Or do you anticipate another IRP update would be needed for more fundamental changes to the Clean Energy outlook? Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks Sharh. The $15.5 billion plan, as you indicated, includes Covert and a nice tranche of renewables. And I'll also point out from a VGP perspective, that's that large customer renewable program. It includes the first tranche of that as well. And so happy to dive in a little bit deeper here. But remember this, that Covert and our renewables build is spelled out in our integrated resource plan. So that's the nature of this 5-year plan, both from a renewable and the development of renewals, the Covert acquisition as well as storage and storage deployment. So that's set. And that IRP really serves as the prudency review and then we go through the regulatory cases to recover on those. And so that plan reflects that. Now your specific question on the IRA, that's additional benefit for our customers. as we've shared, that production tax credit offers savings directly on the execution of that plan. By 2026, that's about $60 million a year of savings for our customers. And so that IRP when we originally filed it was around $600 million or settlement, I should say, was around $600 million of savings for our customers. That only grows as a result of the production tax credit and the IRA. And so that's the nature of how we're applying that. I would remind you as well, based on AMT, we don't anticipate being subject to AMT for really the remainder of the decade, the way that's framing up. And so I don't know, Rejji, do you want to add any additional comment to Shar's question?\nRejji Hayes: No, I think you laid it out pretty well, Garrick. The only thing I would add, you did ask about tax equity at the utility, we're not assuming a tax equity for financing for any of these projects.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, just a question on your updated guidance and sort of the embedded assumptions. You're showing $0.04 of cost savings as a driver for '23, but also highlighted roughly $30 million or about $0.10 of cost savings related to Kam 1 and 2 Covert retirements. What level, I guess, of cost inflation is embedded in the $0.04? Is there a headwind on labor materials? And then more importantly, how are you sort of thinking about that O&M flex beyond that $0.04? Is it closer to the $58 million you achieved in '22?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, sure. I'll cover most of this, and if Garrick wants to add certainly can. To answer your last question first. We're assuming around $45 million to $50 million of cost reductions attributable to the CE Way. So that's what we have embedded in the plan. And we've been pleased to observe over the last several years now that we're at a run rate now of about $45 million, $50 million, which we hit really the pandemic, sometimes necessity is the mother of invention. And so prior to the pandemic, the run rate was about $10 million of O&M reduction. And then we had a really nice inflection point during the pandemic of about $40 million to $45 million of CE Way-driven savings, and that's -- we've held on to that some time. And so that's the working assumption embedded in the plan. I would say Kam 1 and 2, we do anticipate those savings coming through. We'll see some of that in our power supply costs with just less coal procurement, but also, obviously, on the O&M side, there's clearly less staffing attributable to gas plants versus coal. So you'll see some of the savings there. And so that's largely the inputs that we have flowing through that cost productivity line item or the $0.04 that you're seeing in the waterfall from 2022 to 2023. Is that helpful?\nShahriar Pourreza: It is. That\u2019s helpful, Rejji. Thank you, guys. That's all I had. Congrats on the quarter. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Jeremy, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to start off by digging into Dig a little bit if possible. And if I look at Slide 20 here, just wondering if you could walk us through, is this implant or is this upside plan? And just if you could elaborate a little bit, I guess, the future plan for DIG flip to the market or do Michigan customers want the asset? Just trying to see what's happening there. What could happen there?\nGarrick Rochow: I like the way you teed that up. We're going to dig into DIG. It's kind of like my Ferrari comment when I talk about DIG. I mean you may not know this, but the big plan itself is right across from the River Rouge plant where they make the Ford Lightning. And I just happened to get me a Ford Lightning about three weeks ago. So it performs well better than Ferrari. I'll tell you that. So we're going to call the Ford F-150 lightning in the garage from now going forward. But bottom line, here's what we do at DIG. And it's been a historical practice, which really serves us well as we layer in capacity contracts, multiyear capacity contracts and energy contracts over time. And as everyone knows, energy prices and capacity prices have been continuing to rise. There's that upward pressure in there. And so as we layer in these contracts, it's provided additional benefit, additional return from that facility. And so that's what we're reflecting those contracts that have already been inked, you might say, for the improvement in performance. Now we anticipate that to continue to improve as we layer in additional contracts, particularly in -- we're about 50% contracted both for energy and capacity if you get out to the year '26, '27 in that time frame. So there's potential for upside there. And I'll have Rejji walk through what that upside looks like here in just a moment. But why don't you do that, Rejji, then I'll conclude.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So just to go back to the page you referenced, Jeremy, Page 20 in the deck, you see these dark blue bars here at around $30 million. That's a pretty good run rate for the economics we have locked in through capacity and energy contracts here in 2023. And then as you get to the outer years of the plan, you see these light blue sensitivities in the stacked bar chart, and that represents the opportunity if we start to see continued tightening and therefore, improved economics in the bilateral market. And so in the event we see capacity prices go to about $4.50 per kilowatt month. You can see the incremental upside here from a pretax income basis. And then if it gets closer to CONE, and I'll remind everyone that Zone 7 is priced pretty much at CONE for 2 of the last three planning resource auctions. You could see us at a higher level than that with about $25 million of upside. And so as Garrick noted, we wouldn't see those economics until the out of years of the plan, but there's some opportunity as margin opens up in sort of the '25, '26, '27 time frame.\nGarrick Rochow: And let me just conclude there. So there's -- that upside is not in the plan, just to be really clear about that. And to the degree there is upside I want to make sure everyone's clear, there's no sugar highs, right? We deliver 6% to 8%, and we have confidence toward the high end. So I just want to be clear on expectations going forward.\nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful there. And I just want to continue, I guess, with kind of bleed or element to the point here. And looking at the back half of the planned growth drivers outside of rate base. Can you walk us through time line for clarity on the pieces there? Just wondering if there's conservatism on those items as we look at kind of outside of rate base growth later date?\nRejji Hayes: And just -- thank you for the question, Jeremy. And just for everyone's reference, this is the content we have on Slide 6 of the deck. And so we've always talked about the additional growth drivers beyond the rate base as a result of the very constructive legislation. We have in Michigan. And so there's the energy waste reduction opportunities that we have, and we earn economic incentives on that. There's a financial compensation mechanism that we get on PPAs that has been solidified now in two integrated resource plans. And then there is the 10.7% ROE that we get on renewable projects associated with the renewable portfolio standard of Michigan, which we're still executing on. And then there's additional contribution from North Star. And so all of those offer growth to our earnings profile above and beyond what we get in the rate base. And so that 7% or so you're seeing for rate base growth. These would be additive to that. And I would say you get steady contribution for the majority of these. Jeremy, to get to your question. And so with respect to energy waste reduction, we do expect that to increase gradually over the course of the plan. The PPAs. Those will actually ramp up as we do more solar on the contracted side attributable to the IRP. And then we'll see probably more front-end loaded the wind opportunity and then just steady growth at North Star. And so that's really how you should think about the economic opportunity for those non-rate-base opportunities over the course of the plan.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Jeremy.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Julien, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, Good morning. This is [indiscernible] on for Julien. My first question is to just to elaborate on the DIG economics and the opportunity there, how do you see the move from a seasonal auction in MISO or two seasonal option MISO from an annual auction kind of impacting that opportunity, if at all? And how should we think about that there?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So we are assessing MISO's new rules around sort of the seasonal auction. I still think when you cut through it, whether it's a historical process of the new process, you're still going to see a continued tightening of Zone 7. It's still a peninsula. You still have limited transmission importation access to the southern border, and you still have Covert retirements. And so when you have those sort of construct, you're going to see just an imbalance between supply and demand and DIG will start to open up in those outer years. And so we anticipate, as I said before, that we'll potentially see more attractive economics as energy and capacity starts to free up in the outages of the plan. The degree to which it's more attractive, we'll see. I think, obviously, there's -- it's early days. But we certainly think what we're showing on the page and that Slide 20 offers at least a representative or is at least indicative as to where prices may go if we see continued tightening. Again, those light blue bars, that upside opportunity is not incorporated in our plan to be very clear.\nGarrick Rochow: And just to add to that, that old seasonal construct is out there to address resource adequacy. And when you -- the capacity that has been applied over units has the potential to actually reduce some capacity of units. And so that the need grows, certainly in the short to midterm across all of MISO, including Zone 7. So the value of a place like in a facility like DIG should only improve for Rejji's comments.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And switching gears a bit here. Can you quantify the aggregate voluntary regulatory mechanisms in 2022? And as we think about the updated 2023 guidance range, do you have any voluntary mechanism embedded in the range at this time?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So to answer your last question first, Heidi, we do not presuppose any VRM for the 2023 waterfall, or sorry, for our 2023 guidance, and none of that's incorporated in the waterfall, I should say. With respect to the components of the [indiscernible] refill mechanism, we just filed that earlier this year, to be clear, it's $22 million and we're going to allocate a portion of that towards excess capital investments over the course of '22 attributable to emerging capital work like asset relocations demand failures on new business. And so that's a portion of it on the electric side. And then we allocated a good -- the balance of it towards our gas customers, particularly those who are most vulnerable, and we think that's a very prudent use of those resources during these challenging times for customers. And so that's really the spirit of it. Were you also getting at the electric rate case settlement commitments as well?\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, yes, correct. And the donations as well as how we should think about kind of what informs the guidance?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. And so there's none of that incorporated into the 2023 guide either and just to round out the numbers here. So in the electric rate case settlement, we committed to a $15 million bill credit that will benefit customers in 2023. And again, we recognize the expense of that in 2022, and then there was a $10 million again of low-income customer support, again, recognized in 2022 and customers will benefit from that over the course of this year. And so that's really how it works. And none of that is presupposed in our 2023 guide.\nGarrick Rochow: And so if I pull up and look at the big picture here, this is why the Michigan regulatory construct is so strong. You have these mechanisms, whether it's the settlement or whether it's a voluntary refund means that allow us to derisk the future year and offer additional customer benefit. And that's exactly what this $47 million is. And so this gives us -- this is why I'm so confident, we're so confident in our ability and the outlook for 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much. And congrats again on the results.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Heidi.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Michael, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Sullivan: Good morning. One thing I picked up on in your comments of front Garrick was I think you said improved approach on the regulatory side as kind of being key to some of the settlements last year. Can you just give a little more color on what you meant by that and what that means going forward in terms of like being able to consistently settle?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, you remember Q4 call last year. And I was in this spot, and we were saying, hey, we need to improve. We didn't get the best order out of the commission. And we said a couple of things on that call. One, we needed to improve our testimony in our business cases. And we did that. We took two months. We delayed the case by two months, and that's exactly what we worked on. We also adjusted our approach for the electric rate case and how we deliver that and interface with the staff on it. That was a learning that we took from our integrated resource plan filing, we extended that to our electric rate case. And then as we got to August, we saw staff position, it was a very constructive staff position because of all the work that had been done in the testimony and business cases, the improvement that had been done. And that was the foundation. So once you have that constructive foundation, that constructive point where staff is, then it's really an opportunity to work through settlement. And that's exactly what we did working with a number of interveners, the Attorney General, the staff, business community, residential community as well as number of environmental interveners to really have a very constructive outcome with this electric rate case. And so as I look forward, we're going to continue to deploy those methods. We're going to continue to improve the process going forward so that we can set ourselves up for settlement or if we have to go to the final order that we can get a constructive order.\nMichael Sullivan: Great and thanks, that's really helpful. And then just shifting to the CapEx plan and the clean energy spend. Can you guys just quantify like how much on a megawatt basis of renewables you're looking at over the plan and what that looks in terms of split between solar storage, wind?\nGarrick Rochow: Let me - I'll take a crack at it here and Rejji will jump in a little bit too. So in our IRP, there's - obviously, we're replacing coal. And so, I'll just kind of walk through the whole piece of it, so you can see every component of it. So we're going to add about 1.2 gigawatts, that's the Covert facility. We got this RFP out there for 700 megawatts, 500 is dispatchable, 200 is renewables, which will have a PPA for that will get enough financial compensation mechanism on that portion of it. And then in addition to that, we got about 1.2 gigawatts of renewable build-out in that plan that's spelled out in our IRP. And again, 8 gigawatts over the longer piece of 1.2 roughly in that 5-year window. That's a mix of wind and solar. . And then bottom line, we have also in here, what I call energy efficiency and demand response. Those are also play out in that window as well. And then if you're doing the math on this, we're also keeping Kam 3 and 4 around. That's part of it as well, but that's just more of a capacity look. And so, we're in the process of constructing a wind farm right now. That's part of our renewable portfolio standard. That's the one Rejji mentioned in his comments. It's under construction that's about a couple of hundred megawatts of that plan. And the remainder out there is roughly solar and solar build. I will add this, and Shar asked this question earlier and I didn't finish it. But we also have in this plan 300 -- roughly 300 megawatts of voluntary green pricing. This is our large customer renewable program. We've talked about this over previous calls. It's about 1,000 megawatts. We have ability to build and we have subscriptions for that. And we've got our first, you might say, tranche of subscriptions. And then we're building the first - over the course of this plan, we're building the first 300 megawatts. Is that helpful?\nMichael Sullivan: Very helpful and also, add thanks a lot.\nRejji Hayes: And Michael, the only thing I'd add is that you asked about storage as well. I think Garrick have numerated every last bit, and I'll just add storage. We're assuming around 75 megawatts storage in the plan. I mean, obviously, longer term for the IRP, we'll do more than that, but over the course of this five-year plan, about 75 megawatts.\nMichael Sullivan: Great, thanks again. Take care.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Bank. Andrew Weisel, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGarrick Rochow: How is the new baby?\nAndrew Weisel: Hi good morning everyone.\nGarrick Rochow: How is the new baby?\nAndrew Weisel: Good, she is sleeping through the night this week it's a miracle. I just want to elaborate on an earlier question about the non-rate base drivers. I guess my question is what are the offsets if rate base is growing faster than seven plus these adders you're clear that we shouldn't expect more than 8% growth, no sugar highs. So what's keeping the growth below 8%? Is it the equity in the outer years or something else?\nRejji Hayes: Andrew hi, it's Rejji. The only thing I would add is that to Garrick's comment is if you ever need help getting your baby sleep feel free to play back this call. We try to make these calls to the extent [ph]. But to get to your question, I would say, yes, you will see some equity dilution in the outer years of the plan. So as I mentioned, we'll be getting to up to $350 million of equity from '25 through 2027. So that's some of the offset to the non-rate base opportunities. And then we will have some parent funding costs in the outer years of plan beyond equity. So we'll start issuing a little bit of debt. And so that's the other bit as well. So I'd say it's largely on the funding side. I mean is this helpful.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes.\nGarrick Rochow: If I just add to it. It's also the mindset that we have. We're going to - we've got great mechanisms in the state in this construct with the VRM that allow us to offer benefit in the next year for our customers and for our investors and that really helps to derisk. And so, that's another reason why we think about it towards really the long-term versus one year in a sugar high.\nAndrew Weisel: Sounds good. And then on the equity, the number went up. It was up to $250 million, now it's up to $350 million in '25 and beyond. Just wondering what's the driver of that increase? And I know it's up to, but why did it change?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so it's a good question, Andrew. And just to be clear here. So obviously, the capital investment plan has increased materially from the prior vintage. So we were $14.3 billion in the prior five-year plan, we're now $15.5 billion. And we're effectively addressing the Covert needs and that drives about $800 million of that increase. But the balance, we still have incremental investment opportunities above and beyond Covert. And so it's really to balance out the funding for that additional CapEx and obviously maintain our credit metrics kind of in that mid-teens area, which we've always targeted for my prepared remarks. But I will also our general rule of thumb, obviously, is we always want to avoid block equity and we still think even at that level of up to $350 million per year, even where the market cap is right now that's up 2%. And in a perfect world, the market cap will continue to grow, and it will be a much smaller relative to the market cap at that point. So, we think we can triple that out comfortably without any overhang or material pricing risk.\nAndrew Weisel: Agreed, it's definitely not a risk. Just trying to understand does that mean it's going to be more than $250 million and less than $350 million, the way you see it now?\nRejji Hayes: I would say up to $350 million per year.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay fair enough. Thank you very much.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hey good morning thanks for taking my question.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning, I was wondering if you could just specify what you're assuming for load growth in the latest outlook. You had some good commentary too about industrial activity in the state. What are the recent trends you've been experiencing with resi and C&I activity as well?\nRejji Hayes: David, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So let me start with what we saw last year, and it was very consistent with our commentary over the course of each quarter, but we just continue to see good load growth on a weather normalized basis in Michigan. And so, we were down about 1% for residential as we have been highlighting that was actually a little better than plan. But then on the commercial side, we were up over 1.5%. And then industrial, excluding one large low margin customer, up over 2.5% so all in, about a point or 1% on a blended basis. And our expectations are, I'd say, a little tempered going into 2023. And so, we anticipate being a little south of that. And so, we would say probably flat to slightly up all in. Resi continuing to come in as people continue to go back to work. But still commercial, I'd say, roughly 0.5 point in industrial between 1.5% to 2%. So we still anticipate decent load growth, and that does not include any of the robust economic development opportunities that we see in our pipeline at the moment as a result of the Chips and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to see lot of activity, whether it's semiconductor fabs, as Garrick known in his prepared remarks, battery, EV battery supply chain or other energy-intensive businesses. We do hope that we'll see some more, lumpy load opportunity in outer years of the plan so more to come on that.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, I just would add to that under Rejji's good comments there. The Chips Act and the IRA and even the IIJ, that's a super acronyms there. But bottom line, they've helped our business, and they've helped a number of other businesses here in the state from a growth perspective. In addition to that, we've been working closely with the legislature with the Governor's office or site incentives that really make our state as competitive as other states that are offering site incentives. That comes in terms of not only investment in the site from a state perspective, but also incentives to locate here, which has been very helpful. We introduced an economic development rate, which further encourages growth here in the state, and we're seeing some nice some nice low growth over the last year and commitments to Michigan, and I expect more here in short order. And so, I'm excited about that and what that means for our state, both from an investment perspective, growth perspective and particular jobs perspective.\nDavid Arcaro: Great thanks for all that color, very helpful. And I was just wondering, just looking out the equity needs later in the plan and the balance sheet and cash flow at that point. I was wondering, are there any cash flow impacts that come over time potentially from IRA or as you start ramping up renewables and with tax credit dynamics, anything that could help operating cash flow, free up cash flow to further invest at that point that we should think about just as your investment profile shifts in that direction?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, it's a good question, David. So we currently are assuming about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the duration of this plan. So a healthy level, and that's kind of run rate of $2.5 billion or so per year. So clearly, we'll benefit, as Garrick noted earlier, from just lower costs as a result of the production tax will now apply to solar investments. Whether there's incremental upside opportunity for OCF, we'll see. But we try to plan conservatively, and we feel pretty good about the estimates for OCF and the financing plan going forward. And I think it's also worth noting that we don't anticipate being a material payer of federal taxes through the duration of this plan we'll be a partial taxpayer you start to get to '24 and '25, but federal tax cash payments are not a material source of outflow over the course of this plan. And that's kind of been sort of our norm for some time now. So the team continues to do a very effective tax planning to minimize that outflow.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay got you that make sense, thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Durgesh, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning and thank you for taking my question.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey good morning Garrick, thank you for taking my question. Hey just Rejji, I want to go back to the equity financing plan. So the CapEx in both '25 and '26 was raised by $100 million, and that seems to all sort of go the equity from $250 to $350 million. Did the assumptions change in cash flow or did anything else change or you're just building some flexibility in this line. So if you could just talk to that, please?\nRejji Hayes: I would say it's more flexibility than anything else. I mean, I would say it's not as formulaic. It's a $100 million increase in the given year equates to 400% equity financing. I think it's more you see about $400 plus million of incremental capital investment above the prior plan and exclusive of Covert. And so, we're just trying to fund that as thoughtfully as possible. But it's not as formulaic as incremental $100 million in '25 and therefore, incremental $100 million, it's much more is a little more art than that. So I would just say just because there is some flexibility. And hopefully, we don't have to do as much of that. But for now, the guidance is up to $350 million per year, and we think that prudently funds the business and keeps those credit metrics in the mid-teens level to keep the credit ratings we have that we've worked very hard to achieve.\nDurgesh Chopra: Awesome that makes sense. And then maybe just on the Slide 12 here. The $0.19 to $0.25 usage, non-utility tax and other, can you give a little bit of a more detailed breakdown of what's usage and some of the other items, if you can?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so usage non-weather sales, I just provided that in the other question. But like I said, it's flat to slightly up, I would say, about - 25 basis points up all in. We expect residential down over 0.5% as folks come back to pre-pandemic levels. And then you've got commercial up about 0.5 point and then 1.5% to 2% for industrial, again, excluding one large low margin customer. The other big bucket within that $0.19 to $0.25 is just, remember. We had a little of discretionary activities in the fourth quarter. So namely, you've got the VRM which was $22 million, and then you've got another $25 million of electric rate case commitments and so all in that $47 million of Q4 lack [ph] is about $0.12. That does not need to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. And so when you think about that comp of Q4, '22 versus Q4, 2023, you see a lot of that in there. So I'd say it's a combination of those sort of discretionary items that don't need to recur. And then you've got - I'd say relatively modest load assumptions. We've got a little bit of uptick in NorthStar as well. That's the other component of that. And as you can see, we delivered actuals of $0.12 per share at NorthStar in 2022 and the guide for this year 2023 is $0.13 to $0.16. So that's a piece of it as well. It's really those pieces. Is that helpful?\nDurgesh Chopra: Yes, absolutely. Usage and half of it looks like the Q4 flex from '22 to '23 and a couple of pennies at NorthStar?\nRejji Hayes: Bingo.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks so much. Appreciate the time guys, thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey good morning, thanks for squeezing me in here. Just hopefully two quick ones, one was on DIG. Is there a desired amount of capacity you want to leave open in the plan? Do you look longer term and say we want to keep 50% open or 40% open? Are you guys are more opportunistic on that?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, right now, if you look at '23, '24, '25, it's 100% or pretty close to it. So we want to in the upcoming two to three years, we want to fully subscribe - from a capacity and energy perspective. And as you layer in contracts time you get up to 2025, '26 it approaches 50%. So there's room there. And absolutely, we're going to take advantage of opportunities in the energy and capacity markets to layer that in so some longer-term contracts to see really to take advantage of the opportunity out there is with energy and capacity prices. Does that help, Anthony?\nAnthony Crowdell: Yes, absolutely. And then lastly, if I want to maybe look a little longer here, your next IRP filing, I mean the IRP, the guys finished, I guess, I don't know, the '22 or '21, very successful, transformational. What's the timing of the next IRP? And what's that going to look like?\nGarrick Rochow: It just feels like I got through that this year with the settlement, like I'm celebrated. I'm still in my victory lap of that IRP. It was a landmark. And now you're asking about the next one, yes.\nAnthony Crowdell: Parked and Lightning in the garage before you do the victory lab yes.\nGarrick Rochow: So we have to be in there within five years. It's usually a three to five years though. We don't have a plan yet on when that will be. It usually helps to be in around three years just because of the timing of the cycles and of recovery, but no set time yet at this point Anthony, sorry, I can't give you a date yet, but we'll work towards here - the next few years.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great, thanks so much for taking my questions.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Miller: Good morning everyone, thank you?\nGarrick Rochow: Hi Travis, good morning.\nTravis Miller: You actually couple questions ago, you answered my question about unpacking that other $0.19 to $0.25 on next year's earnings. Just one quick follow-up to that, the usage so that's seven that you used $0.07 on the 1% change in the electric side, especially, is that on the numbers that you talked about in terms of what's in the guidance or is that incremental to what's on that guidance to you? You understand my question?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I do follow you. Yes, so the sensitivities that you see Travis on Page 15. This just highlights what the EPS impact would be if we saw another point good or bad relative to plan. And so, the sensitivity around on the electric side is about $0.07 for every percent. Now it obviously depends on mix. And so we're assuming, like I said, for the usage, about, call it, about 0.25% up on a blended basis with resi coming down a little over 0.5% commercial, about 0.5% up and then industrial 1.5% to 2%. And so modeling purposes, that's sort of the base case. And then if we saw any deviation, that's what the sensitivity, provides visibility on. Does that address your question?\nTravis Miller: Yes, yes absolutely. And that could be weather sensitivity, right that's not necessarily just why they're normal I think weather benefit or determines.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, that's exactly, right.\nTravis Miller: Okay very good, that's all. Yes that's all I have, appreciate it.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. So I'll hand the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for concluding remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Adam. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. Certainly hope to see you on the road over the next coming months. So take care and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2022 with adjusted net income of $838 million, which translates to $2.89 per share at the high end of our guidance range. The key drivers of our full year 2022 financial performance were higher sales, driven by favorable weather and solid commercial and industrial load. The latter of which is indicative of the attractive economic conditions in our service territory and rate relief net of investments. These positive drivers were partially offset by higher expenses attributable to discrete customer initiatives, which reduce bills, support our most vulnerable customers and improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems. Our strong performance in 2022 provided significant financial flexibility at year end, which, as Garrick highlighted, enabled us to de-risk our 2023 financial plan to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022, on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enabled us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted-average price of over $68 per share. To address the parent company's financing need for the pending acquisition of the Covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023, and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11, as Garrick noted. We are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years and we also assume modest growth for non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the plant given the lack of financing needs in 2023, beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contracts for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case, amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022. Additionally, we anticipate $0.14 of EPS pickup attributable to the rate - attributable to rate relief, largely driven by our recent electric and gas rate orders and the expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year. As always, our rate relief, figures are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense. As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right hand side, we're assuming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and non-utility performance coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through a regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equates to $0.19 to $0.25 of positive variance versus 2022. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. On Slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll limit my remarks to the metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing need until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our At The Market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027, given the substantial increase in our five-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a - perspective supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has been priced and or refunded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings address to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully de-risked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors, which I'll cover in more detail later. To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2022 on Slide 10, you'll note that we met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From an EPS perspective, our consistent performance above plan over the course of 2022, enable us to raise and narrow our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance on our third quarter call. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $55 million of equity forward contracts as planned and more notably, opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts at a weighted average price of over $6 to $8 per share to address the parent company's financing needs for the pending acquisition of the covert natural gas generation facility in support of our IRP. The only financial target missed in 2022 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility which was budgeted for $2.6 billion. We ended the year just shy of that at $2.5 billion, primarily due to the timing of a wind project in support of Michigan's renewable portfolio standard, which was largely pushed into 2023 and is now under construction. Moving to our 2023 EPS guidance on Slide 11. As Garrick noted, we are raising our 2023 adjusted earnings guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 per share from $3.05 to $3.11 per share with continued confidence toward the high end of the range. As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility as it has for the past several years, and we also assume modest growth for our nonutility business, North Star Clean Energy. Finally, we plan for limited activity at the parent given the lack of financing needs in 2023 beyond the settlement of the aforementioned equity forward contract for the Covert acquisition, while maintaining the usual conservative assumptions throughout the business. To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range, as you'll note on the waterfall chart on Slide 12, we'll plan for normal weather, which in this case amounts to $0.20 per share of negative year-over-year variance, given the absence of the favorable weather we saw in 2022.

As we turn to our cost structure in 2023, you'll note $0.04 per share of positive variance attributable to continued productivity driven by the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives underway. Lastly, the ultimate bar on the right-hand side were stemming the usual conservative estimates around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance, coupled with the benefits of the significant reinvestment activity deployed in the fourth quarter of 2022 through our regulatory filings and traditional operational pull ahead. These assumptions equate to $0.19 to $0.25 of positive variance versus 2022.

On Slide 13, we have a summary of our near- and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll limit the metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly. To that end, we'll look to settle the equity forward contracts for the Covert financing in the second quarter of 2023 and have no additional planned equity financing needs until 2025. In the outer years of our plan, we intend to resume our at-the-market, or ATM, equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year in 2025 through 2027 and given the substantial increase in our 5-year utility customer investment plan. And as such, you can expect us to file a prospectus supplement to reflect this revision to our ATM program later this year. Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility a good portion of which has been priced and/or funded over the past several weeks as noted on the page. In fact, the $825 million of utility bond financings addressed to date include the $400 million tranche of debt financing required to fund the acquisition of Covert in the second quarter. So we have fully derisked our financing needs for that critical component of our IRP well in advance with attractive terms to the benefit of customers and investors. And as a reminder, the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility will enable us to exit coal generation in 2025 and which makes us one of the first vertically integrated utilities in the country to do so. To conclude my remarks on Slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized. Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices. Our diverse workforce remains engaged, well-trained and in our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. No, I think you laid it out pretty well, Garrick. The only thing I would add, you did ask about tax equity at the utility, we're not assuming a tax equity for financing for any of these projects. Yes, sure. I'll cover most of this, and if Garrick wants to add certainly can. To answer your last question first. We're assuming around $45 million to $50 million of cost reductions attributable to the CE Way. So that's what we have embedded in the plan. And we've been pleased to observe over the last several years now that we're at a run rate now of about $45 million, $50 million, which we hit really the pandemic, sometimes necessity is the mother of invention. And so prior to the pandemic, the run rate was about $10 million of O&M reduction. And then we had a really nice inflection point during the pandemic of about $40 million to $45 million of CE Way-driven savings, and that's -- we've held on to that some time. And so that's the working assumption embedded in the plan. I would say Kam 1 and 2, we do anticipate those savings coming through. We'll see some of that in our power supply costs with just less coal procurement, but also, obviously, on the O&M side, there's clearly less staffing attributable to gas plants versus coal. So you'll see some of the savings there. And so that's largely the inputs that we have flowing through that cost productivity line item or the $0.04 that you're seeing in the waterfall from 2022 to 2023. Is that helpful? Yes. So just to go back to the page you referenced, Jeremy, Page 20 in the deck, you see these dark blue bars here at around $30 million. That's a pretty good run rate for the economics we have locked in through capacity and energy contracts here in 2023. And then as you get to the outer years of the plan, you see these light blue sensitivities in the stacked bar chart, and that represents the opportunity if we start to see continued tightening and therefore, improved economics in the bilateral market. And so in the event we see capacity prices go to about $4.50 per kilowatt month. You can see the incremental upside here from a pretax income basis. And then if it gets closer to CONE, and I'll remind everyone that Zone 7 is priced pretty much at CONE for 2 of the last three planning resource auctions. You could see us at a higher level than that with about $25 million of upside. And so as Garrick noted, we wouldn't see those economics until the out of years of the plan, but there's some opportunity as margin opens up in sort of the '25, '26, '27 time frame. And just -- thank you for the question, Jeremy. And just for everyone's reference, this is the content we have on Slide 6 of the deck. And so we've always talked about the additional growth drivers beyond the rate base as a result of the very constructive legislation. We have in Michigan. And so there's the energy waste reduction opportunities that we have, and we earn economic incentives on that. There's a financial compensation mechanism that we get on PPAs that has been solidified now in two integrated resource plans. And then there is the 10.7% ROE that we get on renewable projects associated with the renewable portfolio standard of Michigan, which we're still executing on. And then there's additional contribution from North Star. And so all of those offer growth to our earnings profile above and beyond what we get in the rate base. And so that 7% or so you're seeing for rate base growth. These would be additive to that. And I would say you get steady contribution for the majority of these. Jeremy, to get to your question. And so with respect to energy waste reduction, we do expect that to increase gradually over the course of the plan. The PPAs. Those will actually ramp up as we do more solar on the contracted side attributable to the IRP. And then we'll see probably more front-end loaded the wind opportunity and then just steady growth at North Star. And so that's really how you should think about the economic opportunity for those non-rate-base opportunities over the course of the plan. Thank you. Yes. So we are assessing MISO's new rules around sort of the seasonal auction. I still think when you cut through it, whether it's a historical process of the new process, you're still going to see a continued tightening of Zone 7. It's still a peninsula. You still have limited transmission importation access to the southern border, and you still have Covert retirements. And so when you have those sort of construct, you're going to see just an imbalance between supply and demand and DIG will start to open up in those outer years. And so we anticipate, as I said before, that we'll potentially see more attractive economics as energy and capacity starts to free up in the outages of the plan. The degree to which it's more attractive, we'll see. I think, obviously, there's -- it's early days. But we certainly think what we're showing on the page and that Slide 20 offers at least a representative or is at least indicative as to where prices may go if we see continued tightening. Again, those light blue bars, that upside opportunity is not incorporated in our plan to be very clear. Yes. So to answer your last question first, Heidi, we do not presuppose any VRM for the 2023 waterfall, or sorry, for our 2023 guidance, and none of that's incorporated in the waterfall, I should say. With respect to the components of the [indiscernible] refill mechanism, we just filed that earlier this year, to be clear, it's $22 million and we're going to allocate a portion of that towards excess capital investments over the course of '22 attributable to emerging capital work like asset relocations demand failures on new business. And so that's a portion of it on the electric side. And then we allocated a good -- the balance of it towards our gas customers, particularly those who are most vulnerable, and we think that's a very prudent use of those resources during these challenging times for customers. And so that's really the spirit of it. Were you also getting at the electric rate case settlement commitments as well? Yes. And so there's none of that incorporated into the 2023 guide either and just to round out the numbers here. So in the electric rate case settlement, we committed to a $15 million bill credit that will benefit customers in 2023. And again, we recognize the expense of that in 2022, and then there was a $10 million again of low-income customer support, again, recognized in 2022 and customers will benefit from that over the course of this year. And so that's really how it works. And none of that is presupposed in our 2023 guide. And Michael, the only thing I'd add is that you asked about storage as well. I think Garrick have numerated every last bit, and I'll just add storage. We're assuming around 75 megawatts storage in the plan. I mean, obviously, longer term for the IRP, we'll do more than that, but over the course of this five-year plan, about 75 megawatts. Andrew hi, it's Rejji. The only thing I would add is that to Garrick's comment is if you ever need help getting your baby sleep feel free to play back this call. We try to make these calls to the extent [ph]. But to get to your question, I would say, yes, you will see some equity dilution in the outer years of the plan. So as I mentioned, we'll be getting to up to $350 million of equity from '25 through 2027. So that's some of the offset to the non-rate base opportunities. And then we will have some parent funding costs in the outer years of plan beyond equity. So we'll start issuing a little bit of debt. And so that's the other bit as well. So I'd say it's largely on the funding side. I mean is this helpful. Yes, so it's a good question, Andrew. And just to be clear here. So obviously, the capital investment plan has increased materially from the prior vintage. So we were $14.3 billion in the prior five-year plan, we're now $15.5 billion. And we're effectively addressing the Covert needs and that drives about $800 million of that increase. But the balance, we still have incremental investment opportunities above and beyond Covert. And so it's really to balance out the funding for that additional CapEx and obviously maintain our credit metrics kind of in that mid-teens area, which we've always targeted for my prepared remarks. But I will also our general rule of thumb, obviously, is we always want to avoid block equity and we still think even at that level of up to $350 million per year, even where the market cap is right now that's up 2%. And in a perfect world, the market cap will continue to grow, and it will be a much smaller relative to the market cap at that point. So, we think we can triple that out comfortably without any overhang or material pricing risk. I would say up to $350 million per year. David, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So let me start with what we saw last year, and it was very consistent with our commentary over the course of each quarter, but we just continue to see good load growth on a weather normalized basis in Michigan. And so, we were down about 1% for residential as we have been highlighting that was actually a little better than plan. But then on the commercial side, we were up over 1.5%. And then industrial, excluding one large low margin customer, up over 2.5% so all in, about a point or 1% on a blended basis. And our expectations are, I'd say, a little tempered going into 2023. And so, we anticipate being a little south of that. And so, we would say probably flat to slightly up all in. Resi continuing to come in as people continue to go back to work. But still commercial, I'd say, roughly 0.5 point in industrial between 1.5% to 2%. So we still anticipate decent load growth, and that does not include any of the robust economic development opportunities that we see in our pipeline at the moment as a result of the Chips and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, we continue to see lot of activity, whether it's semiconductor fabs, as Garrick known in his prepared remarks, battery, EV battery supply chain or other energy-intensive businesses. We do hope that we'll see some more, lumpy load opportunity in outer years of the plan so more to come on that. Yes, it's a good question, David. So we currently are assuming about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow generation over the duration of this plan. So a healthy level, and that's kind of run rate of $2.5 billion or so per year. So clearly, we'll benefit, as Garrick noted earlier, from just lower costs as a result of the production tax will now apply to solar investments. Whether there's incremental upside opportunity for OCF, we'll see. But we try to plan conservatively, and we feel pretty good about the estimates for OCF and the financing plan going forward. And I think it's also worth noting that we don't anticipate being a material payer of federal taxes through the duration of this plan we'll be a partial taxpayer you start to get to '24 and '25, but federal tax cash payments are not a material source of outflow over the course of this plan. And that's kind of been sort of our norm for some time now. So the team continues to do a very effective tax planning to minimize that outflow. I would say it's more flexibility than anything else. I mean, I would say it's not as formulaic. It's a $100 million increase in the given year equates to 400% equity financing. I think it's more you see about $400 plus million of incremental capital investment above the prior plan and exclusive of Covert. And so, we're just trying to fund that as thoughtfully as possible. But it's not as formulaic as incremental $100 million in '25 and therefore, incremental $100 million, it's much more is a little more art than that. So I would just say just because there is some flexibility. And hopefully, we don't have to do as much of that. But for now, the guidance is up to $350 million per year, and we think that prudently funds the business and keeps those credit metrics in the mid-teens level to keep the credit ratings we have that we've worked very hard to achieve. Yes, so usage non-weather sales, I just provided that in the other question. But like I said, it's flat to slightly up, I would say, about - 25 basis points up all in. We expect residential down over 0.5% as folks come back to pre-pandemic levels. And then you've got commercial up about 0.5 point and then 1.5% to 2% for industrial, again, excluding one large low margin customer. The other big bucket within that $0.19 to $0.25 is just, remember. We had a little of discretionary activities in the fourth quarter. So namely, you've got the VRM which was $22 million, and then you've got another $25 million of electric rate case commitments and so all in that $47 million of Q4 lack [ph] is about $0.12. That does not need to take place in the fourth quarter of this year. And so when you think about that comp of Q4, '22 versus Q4, 2023, you see a lot of that in there. So I'd say it's a combination of those sort of discretionary items that don't need to recur. And then you've got - I'd say relatively modest load assumptions. We've got a little bit of uptick in NorthStar as well. That's the other component of that. And as you can see, we delivered actuals of $0.12 per share at NorthStar in 2022 and the guide for this year 2023 is $0.13 to $0.16. So that's a piece of it as well. It's really those pieces. Is that helpful? Bingo. Yes, I do follow you. Yes, so the sensitivities that you see Travis on Page 15. This just highlights what the EPS impact would be if we saw another point good or bad relative to plan. And so, the sensitivity around on the electric side is about $0.07 for every percent. Now it obviously depends on mix. And so we're assuming, like I said, for the usage, about, call it, about 0.25% up on a blended basis with resi coming down a little over 0.5% commercial, about 0.5% up and then industrial 1.5% to 2%. And so modeling purposes, that's sort of the base case. And then if we saw any deviation, that's what the sensitivity, provides visibility on. Does that address your question? Yes, that's exactly, right."

            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you everyone for joining us today. 2022, an outstanding year at CMS Energy, both operationally and financially. And even more than that, 2022 marks the 20th year CMS Energy has consistently delivered industry-leading financial performance. Many of you have been on this journey with us. And I appreciate you and I thank you. You see us put our words into action. Our performance is supported by our simple investment thesis, which delivers for our customers and investors. We continue to lead the clean energy transformation. Our net zero commitments backed up by the solid plans in approved Integrated Resource Plan, IRP, provide certainty for investments in clean energy and highlight the supportive regulatory construct in Michigan. Across the company, we are disciplined about taking cost out and working every day to get better. We use the CE Way from corporate functions to the frontline to achieve our operational and financial objectives. This focus keeps customer bills affordable. On the regulatory front, it's been an incredible year. We sold not one, not two, but three major cases highlighting the top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. All of this leads to a premium total shareholder return you've come to expect from CMS Energy. I want to take a few minutes to share some of the big wins we had over the year. First, our commitment to people, our co-workers, who show up every day with the heart of service, and our customers who count on us to be there in any weather with safe, reliable, affordable and clean energy. In 2022, we were recognized nationwide as the Best Employer for Women in the Utility Sector, a Top Employer for Diversity and one of the Best Large Employers by Forbes, this team of co-workers, who continue to deliver results, utilizing the CE Way. In 2022, our co-workers commitment to being best-in-class in the operation of our generating assets saved our customers roughly $560 million. This is more than double what we delivered in 2021 mean our team continues to drive more value by running our own generation, more efficiently than the market. Just to make this real, in December, during the storm Elliott, when others were short power, this team and these generation assets were exporting energy out of Michigan into MISO. And I'm also pleased with the growth in economic development we've seen and helped lead in the state. As I shared in the Q3 call semiconductors, polysilicon and battery manufacturing, up all calling Michigan Home, 230 MW of new and expanding load with over $8 billion of investment in Michigan. A recent Department of Energy study ranks Michigan as a Top 3 state for planned battery plant capacity further differentiating our state and service territory. Our commitment across the state have delivered more load growth, more jobs and more investment, all of which create an environment. And our state looks strong well into the future. We remain focused on getting ready for that future with our IRP, which delivers even more savings to our customers with roughly $600 million in savings over our prior plan and reduces our carbon footprint by over 60% as we exit coal in 2025 amid 8 gigawatts of store and 550 megawatts of battery through 2040. We continued our long track record of managing costs and keeping prices affordable through the CE Way, and delivering $58 million of savings in 2022. This level of discipline to continuously improve has been a contributor to the successful regulatory outcomes in our settled electric and gas rate cases, which is highlighted by the $47 million of regulatory mechanisms to support infrastructure investments and assist customers. This year both our customers and investors will benefit from our $22 million voluntary refund mechanism, a $15 million bill credit and $10 million of customer assistance. These regulatory mechanisms de-risk 2023, while providing needed customer benefit. It's this strong execution in these results that you and we expect and meet our commitment to the triple bottom-line positioning our business for sustainable long-term growth. 2022 marks another year of premium growth. The team continued to deliver regardless of conditions. In 2022, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $2.89 at the high-end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2023 adjusted full-year EPS guidance to $3.06 to $3.12 from $3.05 to $3.11 per share, compounding off of 2022 actuals like you would expect from a premium name like CMS Energy. We continue to expect to be toward the high-end of this range, which points to the midpoint or higher signaling are confident as we start the year in a strong position. Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $1.95 per share for 2023. Longer-term, we continue to have confidence toward the high-end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, and we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. And finally, I'm pleased to share we have refreshed our five-year utility customer investment plan, increasing our prior plan by $1.2 billion to $15.5 billion through 2027. I have confidence in our plan for 2023 and beyond given our longstanding ability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth. It's no coincidence that I started my prepared remarks with our investment thesis. We live by it and it works. On Slide 6, we've highlighted our new five-year $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan. This translates to greater than 7% annual rate base growth in support safety and reliability investments in our electric and gas systems and paves the way to a clean-energy future when net zero carbon, methane and greenhouse gas emissions. You will note that about 40% of our customer investments support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gas system, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. Bottom line, we have a long and robust capital runway. Beyond our core investments, we have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. This includes adders built into legislation where incentives on our energy efficiency and demand response programs and the financial compensation mechanism, FCM we earn on PPAs. We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business NorthStar Clean Energy as they see continued growth in their contracted renewables, as well as better pricing from capacity and energy sold at our DIG facility. We continue to earn a 10.7% ROE on renewables to meet our renewable portfolio standard and are in the process of completing Heartland Wind Project in 2023. These regulatory incentives are a core part of Michigan's energy law which with our strong regulatory construct continues to support needed customer investments. In addition, the Energy Law provides certainty of recovery before looking 10-month rate cases in regular fuel tracking mechanisms and allow us to help smooth the impact of commodity prices for our customers. I used the word incredible to describe this earlier. We delivered across the board the settlements in IRP and our gas and electric rate cases providing more certainty for 2023 customer investments. This wasn't by accident. We have a supportive law, strong regulatory construct and our improved regulatory approach enables us to work with multiple parties on complex cases and provide the best outcome for our customers and investors. And we plan to continue the strong performance in the next rate case cycle. We filed our gas case in December and we file our next electric rate case later this year with those outcomes providing further certainty for 2024 customer investments. We know a robust customer investment plan in strong regulatory construct loan do not support sustainable growth. Our customers count on us to keep their bills affordable. Inflation has been top of mind for many throughout 2022 and remains so as we enter 2023. First, I'll remind everyone that CMS Energy is well positioned as it relates to the key sources of inflation including labor, materials and commodities. In addition, we delivered roughly $150 million in CE Way savings over the last three years and estimate over $200 million in large, episodic savings as PPAs expire and as we exit coal generation. We're also seeing significant new and expanding commercial and industrial load in our service territory. There is a broad spectrum of growth. Some customers have opened new facilities this year and some are in early construction. These new sales opportunities, both in the short and long-term, allow us to spread our costs across a growing customer base, ultimately reducing rates for all of our customers. It should be no surprised why I'm pleased with 2022, and confident in the 2023 outlook. This proven approach continues to deliver. Now I'll pass the call over to Rejji, who will offer additional detail. Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and has withstood the test of time. It delivers in a very balanced way for all our stakeholders and enables us to consistently deliver our financial objectives. 2022 was an outstanding year, marking our 20th year of industry-leading financial performance. I'm confident in our refresh $15.5 billion utility customer investment plan, the ability to execute on it and in our regulatory construct to support it as well as our solid track record of managing costs we keep customer bills affordable. Finally, we deliver regardless of conditions, not by luck, or accident, but by a great team who runs a proven model, who sees discipline in the work. This is what led to an outstanding 2022 and provides for a strong outlook in 2023 and beyond. With that, Adam, please open the lines for Q&A. Thanks Sharh. The $15.5 billion plan, as you indicated, includes Covert and a nice tranche of renewables. And I'll also point out from a VGP perspective, that's that large customer renewable program. It includes the first tranche of that as well. And so happy to dive in a little bit deeper here. But remember this, that Covert and our renewables build is spelled out in our integrated resource plan. So that's the nature of this 5-year plan, both from a renewable and the development of renewals, the Covert acquisition as well as storage and storage deployment. So that's set. And that IRP really serves as the prudency review and then we go through the regulatory cases to recover on those. And so that plan reflects that. Now your specific question on the IRA, that's additional benefit for our customers. as we've shared, that production tax credit offers savings directly on the execution of that plan. By 2026, that's about $60 million a year of savings for our customers. And so that IRP when we originally filed it was around $600 million or settlement, I should say, was around $600 million of savings for our customers. That only grows as a result of the production tax credit and the IRA. And so that's the nature of how we're applying that. I would remind you as well, based on AMT, we don't anticipate being subject to AMT for really the remainder of the decade, the way that's framing up. And so I don't know, Rejji, do you want to add any additional comment to Shar's question? I like the way you teed that up. We're going to dig into DIG. It's kind of like my Ferrari comment when I talk about DIG. I mean you may not know this, but the big plan itself is right across from the River Rouge plant where they make the Ford Lightning. And I just happened to get me a Ford Lightning about three weeks ago. So it performs well better than Ferrari. I'll tell you that. So we're going to call the Ford F-150 lightning in the garage from now going forward. But bottom line, here's what we do at DIG. And it's been a historical practice, which really serves us well as we layer in capacity contracts, multiyear capacity contracts and energy contracts over time. And as everyone knows, energy prices and capacity prices have been continuing to rise. There's that upward pressure in there. And so as we layer in these contracts, it's provided additional benefit, additional return from that facility. And so that's what we're reflecting those contracts that have already been inked, you might say, for the improvement in performance. Now we anticipate that to continue to improve as we layer in additional contracts, particularly in -- we're about 50% contracted both for energy and capacity if you get out to the year '26, '27 in that time frame. So there's potential for upside there. And I'll have Rejji walk through what that upside looks like here in just a moment. But why don't you do that, Rejji, then I'll conclude. And let me just conclude there. So there's -- that upside is not in the plan, just to be really clear about that. And to the degree there is upside I want to make sure everyone's clear, there's no sugar highs, right? We deliver 6% to 8%, and we have confidence toward the high end. So I just want to be clear on expectations going forward. Thank you, Jeremy. And just to add to that, that old seasonal construct is out there to address resource adequacy. And when you -- the capacity that has been applied over units has the potential to actually reduce some capacity of units. And so that the need grows, certainly in the short to midterm across all of MISO, including Zone 7. So the value of a place like in a facility like DIG should only improve for Rejji's comments. And so if I pull up and look at the big picture here, this is why the Michigan regulatory construct is so strong. You have these mechanisms, whether it's the settlement or whether it's a voluntary refund means that allow us to derisk the future year and offer additional customer benefit. And that's exactly what this $47 million is. And so this gives us -- this is why I'm so confident, we're so confident in our ability and the outlook for 2023. Thank you, Heidi. Well, you remember Q4 call last year. And I was in this spot, and we were saying, hey, we need to improve. We didn't get the best order out of the commission. And we said a couple of things on that call. One, we needed to improve our testimony in our business cases. And we did that. We took two months. We delayed the case by two months, and that's exactly what we worked on. We also adjusted our approach for the electric rate case and how we deliver that and interface with the staff on it. That was a learning that we took from our integrated resource plan filing, we extended that to our electric rate case. And then as we got to August, we saw staff position, it was a very constructive staff position because of all the work that had been done in the testimony and business cases, the improvement that had been done. And that was the foundation. So once you have that constructive foundation, that constructive point where staff is, then it's really an opportunity to work through settlement. And that's exactly what we did working with a number of interveners, the Attorney General, the staff, business community, residential community as well as number of environmental interveners to really have a very constructive outcome with this electric rate case. And so as I look forward, we're going to continue to deploy those methods. We're going to continue to improve the process going forward so that we can set ourselves up for settlement or if we have to go to the final order that we can get a constructive order. Let me - I'll take a crack at it here and Rejji will jump in a little bit too. So in our IRP, there's - obviously, we're replacing coal. And so, I'll just kind of walk through the whole piece of it, so you can see every component of it. So we're going to add about 1.2 gigawatts, that's the Covert facility. We got this RFP out there for 700 megawatts, 500 is dispatchable, 200 is renewables, which will have a PPA for that will get enough financial compensation mechanism on that portion of it. And then in addition to that, we got about 1.2 gigawatts of renewable build-out in that plan that's spelled out in our IRP. And again, 8 gigawatts over the longer piece of 1.2 roughly in that 5-year window. That's a mix of wind and solar. . And then bottom line, we have also in here, what I call energy efficiency and demand response. Those are also play out in that window as well. And then if you're doing the math on this, we're also keeping Kam 3 and 4 around. That's part of it as well, but that's just more of a capacity look. And so, we're in the process of constructing a wind farm right now. That's part of our renewable portfolio standard. That's the one Rejji mentioned in his comments. It's under construction that's about a couple of hundred megawatts of that plan. And the remainder out there is roughly solar and solar build. I will add this, and Shar asked this question earlier and I didn't finish it. But we also have in this plan 300 -- roughly 300 megawatts of voluntary green pricing. This is our large customer renewable program. We've talked about this over previous calls. It's about 1,000 megawatts. We have ability to build and we have subscriptions for that. And we've got our first, you might say, tranche of subscriptions. And then we're building the first - over the course of this plan, we're building the first 300 megawatts. Is that helpful? How is the new baby? How is the new baby? If I just add to it. It's also the mindset that we have. We're going to - we've got great mechanisms in the state in this construct with the VRM that allow us to offer benefit in the next year for our customers and for our investors and that really helps to derisk. And so, that's another reason why we think about it towards really the long-term versus one year in a sugar high. Thank you. Good morning, David. Yes, I just would add to that under Rejji's good comments there. The Chips Act and the IRA and even the IIJ, that's a super acronyms there. But bottom line, they've helped our business, and they've helped a number of other businesses here in the state from a growth perspective. In addition to that, we've been working closely with the legislature with the Governor's office or site incentives that really make our state as competitive as other states that are offering site incentives. That comes in terms of not only investment in the site from a state perspective, but also incentives to locate here, which has been very helpful. We introduced an economic development rate, which further encourages growth here in the state, and we're seeing some nice some nice low growth over the last year and commitments to Michigan, and I expect more here in short order. And so, I'm excited about that and what that means for our state, both from an investment perspective, growth perspective and particular jobs perspective. Good morning, Durgesh. Thank you. Well, right now, if you look at '23, '24, '25, it's 100% or pretty close to it. So we want to in the upcoming two to three years, we want to fully subscribe - from a capacity and energy perspective. And as you layer in contracts time you get up to 2025, '26 it approaches 50%. So there's room there. And absolutely, we're going to take advantage of opportunities in the energy and capacity markets to layer that in so some longer-term contracts to see really to take advantage of the opportunity out there is with energy and capacity prices. Does that help, Anthony? It just feels like I got through that this year with the settlement, like I'm celebrated. I'm still in my victory lap of that IRP. It was a landmark. And now you're asking about the next one, yes. So we have to be in there within five years. It's usually a three to five years though. We don't have a plan yet on when that will be. It usually helps to be in around three years just because of the timing of the cycles and of recovery, but no set time yet at this point Anthony, sorry, I can't give you a date yet, but we'll work towards here - the next few years. Thank you. Hi Travis, good morning. Thank you. Thanks, Adam. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today for our year-end earnings call. Certainly hope to see you on the road over the next coming months. So take care and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder that there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today, beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time, running through November 3rd. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Maxine. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased with the results for the quarter and the path to year-end. But before I get into specifics, I want to start with our simple investment thesis, which continues to stay on the test of time. You've seen this in our calls and meetings and you've seen the results. It works. This is where we put our words into action. We remain firmly committed to leading the clean energy transformation. As I mentioned on the Q2 call, the approval of our IRP was a proof point, evident that we have a clear pathway supported by the regulatory construct to deliver on our leading clean energy commitment. Our investment thesis is fueled by our commitment to eliminate waste, driven by the CE Way. I put us up against anyone in our ability to take cost out. This year, we are on track to take $50 million of O&M waste out of the business. The CE Way is critical to delivering our operational and financial performance and keeping our service affordable for our customers. Another critical element is our top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. In Q2, we not only delivered our IRP, but we settled our gas rate case. And in this quarter, we received constructive feedback on our pending electric rate case, further evidence of the health of the Michigan regulatory environment. A key part of our investment thesis, which we don't talk about enough is our diverse and attractive service territory. I'm excited about both the pace and impact of new growth in Michigan. Just this month, our governor announced that Goshen, a global electric vehicle battery manufacturer selected Michigan for its U.S. expansion over many other states, highlighting another example of onshoring manufacturing within the state. This project is expected to add over 2,000 jobs and provide $2.4 billion of investment. In August, President Biden joined Governor Whitmer at Hemlock Semiconductor headquartered here in the heart of our service territory. Together, they announced an executive directive to guide the implementation of the CHIPS Act, which will boost domestic chip production and bolster Michigan's leadership in the semiconductor industry. Let me put that into perspective. Hemlock is one of the largest polysilicon manufacturers in the world. Nearly one third of the world's ships are made from polysilicon produced at that facility right here in Michigan. In September, Hemlock announced plans to grow its operation. The project is expected to add 170 jobs and $375 million of investment in the state. Ground has already been broken on the expansion. Also the expansion of SK Siltron, now in operation, a semiconductor wafer manufacturer bringing 150 jobs and over $300 million of investment to the state. These are highlights over the quarter. From the map on the slide, you can see we secured over 80 agreements year-to-date, which translates to roughly 200 megawatts of new or expanding load in our service territory. This growth is bolstered by collaborative and innovative economic development efforts, supported by competitive rates for energy-intensive customers and robust policy, which are working and continue to drive growth. Our work with the Governor's office, the legislature, Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the commission has made it possible for Michigan to not only compete, but win investment and new jobs. These economic tailwinds are just a few of many we've seen and continue to see across Michigan that will help attract more business. grow industrial, commercial and residential load and ultimately provide long-term bill relief for all our customers. Our strong commitment to decarbonize both our gas and electric systems is a key differentiator for CMS Energy. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is another catalyst for our clean energy transformation, supporting deployment of renewables and lowering costs for our customers. We see a lot of benefit in this new legislation. The extension of tax credits for both wind and solar provide economic certainty and lowers cost for our robust renewal backlog within our IRP which includes 8 gigawatts of solar, as well as the remaining 200 megawatts of wind, we are constructing to meet Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. Production tax credits for solar projects will drive cost competitiveness for utility-owned projects versus PPAs. As we build scale, this cost competitiveness has enabled us to own in rate base a greater portion of future IRP solar investment. The investment tax credit for storage will lower cost and provide greater flexibility as we're able to site storage strategically across the grid. Our IRP includes 75 megawatts of battery storage, beginning in 2024, and could accelerate or increase the 550 megawatts of battery storage through 2040. These tax advantages reduce the cost of new solar roughly 15%, providing annual cost savings of $60 million versus our plan. Also, with the use of tax deductions and credit, we do not expect a material impact in the alternative minimum tax through the remainder of the decade. All of this helps our customers with more savings. It's a supports our commitment to grow Michigan. It drives the transformation to clean energy and our growing voluntary green pricing program. Bottom line, this legislation is a great tailwind across the board. Now let's get into the numbers. Year-to-date, we've delivered $2.29 of adjusted earnings per share and remain ahead of plan. With confidence in this year, we're raising the bottom end of our guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.89 per share. For 2023, we are initiating our full year preliminary guidance of $3.05 to $3.11 per share, which reflects 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of our revised 2022 guidance, and we expect to be toward the high end of that range. And remember, we've always rebase our guidance of actual compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. Our long-term dividend growth remains at 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. We'll provide you with an update on our guidance, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call early next year. Lastly, we are confident in both our outlook and our ability to deliver our financial and operational targets for the remainder of the year, which brings me to my last slide. In a few weeks, Michigan will have elections across the state. New people will join the legislature. We'll also see the results of the race for governor. Whatever the outcome, we will work effectively as we have for a decade with whoever holds off it. You've heard us say it before. We deliver regardless of conditions, nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance. You can count on CMS Energy for that. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji to offer additional detail.\nRejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, our third quarter results are a continuation of the strong performance we have delivered throughout the year, keeping us ahead of plan and positioning us well to achieve our financial objectives in 2022. To elaborate, year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $662 million or $2.29 per share, up $0.11 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, largely driven by favorable weather, including more normalized storm activity in our service territory and healthy economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more details on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As Garrick mentioned, our solid year-to-date performance has driven our revised 2022 adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects an increase in the lower end of the range to $2.87 from $2.85. So our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance has now been raised and narrowed to $2.87 to $2.89. As noted, favorable sales continue to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance, largely driven by weather, equating to $0.13 per share of positive variance. Our strong sales were partially offset by planned increases in operating and maintenance or O&M expense, largely driven by customer initiatives, which are embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization to the tune of $0.03 per share of negative variance versus the first 9 months of 2021. It is worth noting that the aforementioned year-over-year increase in O&M expense was partially offset by lower service restoration expense versus the comparable period in 2021 as anticipated. Lastly, the $0.01 per share of positive variance in the final year-to-date bucket reflects higher non-weather sales of the utility attributable to continued strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, slightly offset by a drag of the parent from our preferred stock dividend and select regulatory items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our revised full year EPS guidance range. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a positive impact of about $0.08 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We're also assuming - we are also assuming $0.11 per share of positive variance versus the fourth quarter of 2021 attributable to rate relief associated with the October 1 implementation of new rates from our constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And these estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and interest expense. In addition to said cost, our plan assumes increased O&M expense in the fourth quarter versus 2021 for key customer programs such as vegetation management, one of the most effective measures to reduce system outages. And I'll note that we're on course for a record level of vegetation management spend in 2022, given our focus on improving the reliability of our grid. We also expect to continue to benefit from normalized storm activity, which nets to $0.11 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021. To close out our assumptions for the remainder of 2022, we assume the usual conservative assumptions for our non-utility business and weather normalized load at the utility. We have also maintained a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance which when coupled with our non-utility and load assumptions equates to $0.17 to $0.19 per share, a negative variance highlighted in the [indiscernible] chart. As such, we have substantial financial flexibility heading into the final three months of the year, which increases our confidence in delivering for customers and investors in 2022 and beyond. Turning to our 2022 financing plan on Slide nine. I'm pleased to report that we have successfully completed our planned financings for the year with $800 million of debt issuances at the utility priced at a weighted average coupon of 3.9% which is well below indicative levels in the current environment. \\ And while our plan did not call for any financing at the parent this year, we opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts during the quarter at a weighted average price of $68 per share. Our timely execution of the equity forward locks in attractive terms for the parent financing needs of the pending acquisition of the new covert natural gas generation facility. The settlement of the equity forward will largely occur in the first half of 2023 concurrent with the acquisition timing and in accordance with our recently approved integrated resource plan. Staying on the balance sheet. As we move into the winter heating season, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper. And needless to say, we'll continue to monitor market conditions to try to lock in attractive terms for future financing opportunities at the utility. Lastly, it's important to highlight that we have no debt maturities or planned financings at the parent in 2023 and virtually no floating rate exposure outside of the utility, which largely insulates our income statement from future interest rate volatility. Our opportunistic a prudent financing strategy reduces cost while limiting uncertainty in our cost structure, enabling us to fund our capital plan in a cost-efficient manner for the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Maxine to open the lines for Q&A.\nQ - Insoo Kim: Yeah, thank you. Thanks for the update. Just first question, I think there's just been a lot of conversation about the recent opening of the docket [ph] for the Michigan store mode [ph] at process. Could you just give me give a \u2013 give us an indication of the conversations you've had with the commission kind of where their head's at and what the potential range of outcomes could be here?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thanks, Insoo, for your question. A couple of things on this. I think it's important to understand, particularly in August here had some storm. We performed well during the storm. But again, it's catching a little media attention. And I think one of the things that's really important to recognize here in Michigan is the impacts the great Lakes and what Lake Michigan does to the weather and storms. And then also just a longer-term trend we see is increasing wind speeds across Michigan in part due to climate change. And the bottom line is we see a real investment opportunity and resiliency. The commission has been supportive of many of the reliability and resiliency efforts in our electric rate case, but there's more to do. There's more to do in this space. And so I really view this as a collaboration where we can work to. Again, I think we're both the commission and the company are well aligned here in what we need to do in terms of reliability and resiliency. So I really view it as an opportunity where those opportunities are and create the path to improve that for our customers.\nInsoo Kim: Is there a set time line on when we should have more clarity on the outcome from all of this?\nGarrick Rochow: There is a first effort that's due here in November 4th. I would imagine the audit takes place over much of the fiscal year of 2023. And again, I see that as a collaborative effort. We want the same thing. We have the same goal, and it's really aligned to make sure we have all the right measures and investments in place to achieve that goal and they're at the right speed and pacing.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. My last question, just thank you for the preliminary guidance on '23 and pointing to that upper end. Should we think of the Covert acquisition and the financing all embedded in that upper end? And I guess, what potential items could deviate from that range even if it could be a potential upside from there? Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Yeah. The short answer is yes, on Covert and the financing is in that piece. But I'm going to just step back and think of the bigger picture here. And so how I think about this and how we think about this as a company. So this guidance here is 6% to 8%, and we expect toward the high end. We really think that offers a premium across the sector. And we've been doing this for 20 years of industry-leading financial performance. And then I think what's unique about us, and again, differentiates us and there's a strength and frankly, a premium is that we rebase off of actual. So we do this time and time again. And so we're not in the sugar highs. It's a long-term play where we're going to continue to deliver towards the high end. So I feel good. We feel good about the guidance we've offered here today at 305 to 311 and one more thing on this. I want to make sure everyone understands, too, that this is an important balance, a balance of our customers, other stakeholders like regulators and legislators as well as you, our investors.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Hey, good morning, Shar.\\\nShar Pourreza: Morning, morning. So just a question on IRA [ph], I guess, how impacted your thoughts around the IRP. I mean clearly, you guys highlighted the customer benefits and lower cost of solar, but does it or can it trigger I guess, any sort of revision to the plan as it currently stands? Garrick, I think you may have alluded to a little bit of that in the prepared. And in particular, do you have any sort of tax equity embedded in renewable spending? And do you have any opportunity to avoid tax equity where we could see a potential increase in rate base?\nGarrick Rochow: I'll tag team this with Rejji here. This IRA is really beneficial for our industry and beneficial for our customers. And so as you know, we've laid out our IRP to 8 gigawatts, the storage build, it's a nice plan. And we go in every three to five years to revise that. And so in the short term, I really see the benefit of the IRA in this production tax credit flowing right to our customers. That's the $60 million per year versus plan. So that, again, keeps our customers' costs low, frankly. And remember, this IRP had $600 million of savings already baked in over that, and this is incremental to that. So again, feel good about that. In respect to my other comments, we'll file, refile our IRP in three to five years. And with this - with the IRA, there's upside opportunities in terms of our tailwind opportunities in terms of pulling renewables forward, potentially Poland storage forward. We'll have to take a look at that. Again, I see this as a real advantage to utility-owned solar and storage versus PPAs. I know Rejji, you may have additional comments.\nRejji Hayes: Yeah, sure. I would only add a couple of comments here. The other benefit, too, is just with the continuation of the tax credit for electric vehicles, well, that certainly could be a catalyst in accelerating the tipping point of electric vehicle proliferation in Michigan, and obviously, that would bring rate benefits as well because you're growing the denominator in that rate calculation, bring kilowatt hours into Michigan, which we would welcome. So there's a benefit there that should be, at some point, incorporated into our financials longer term. With respect to your question around financing, we are not presupposing any tax equity in our funding strategy. So the IRA, there's been a lot of talk about the transferability of credits. I still think there's more guidance required from the IRS and we'll see what type of market develops as a result of transferability of credits. We certainly do have credits so we can monetize at some point. But at the moment, we're not presupposing any tax equity in our financing assumptions.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Got you. Sorry, just a quick follow-up. It's just I guess you guys have never had a shortage of capital growth opportunities, right? It's always been a function of bills and rates being at kind of the governor, customer rates. I guess, the $60 million incremental in customer savings, does that allow a pull forward of some of that spend because you have that incremental headroom? Or do we have to wait for the additional IRP filing? I guess I'm just trying to figure out how that plays in.\nGarrick Rochow: Yeah. I don't think you have to wait until the IRP filing for that. It's really a function of how we build out our capital plan. And as we've shared historically, we look at what the customer can afford. We look at how can we execute work, we look at the business cases, we look at the mix, where we put in dollars strategically. So there's a bottom-up buildup for that capital plan. And so as we're able to create more headroom or as - we have, in the case of afford [ph] of the bills, we'll look at how do we put those important capital investments into the system that ultimately provide value for our customers. And so that's the balance will strike. And you'll see it as it plays out here in our Q4 call in the 5-year capital.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just a quick one for Rejji. Just I guess beyond the Covert purchase as you guys are looking at your 5-year plan enrolling in more IRP spending into plan, including renewables, do you anticipate any associated financing need or the issuance last quarter took care of those needs as we're thinking about the current plan and slightly beyond the current plan, I guess?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. So I appreciate the question, Shar. And just for Symantec, we haven't issued the equity yet. We just put in place forward contracts. And so we've locked in the price, we'll issue, obviously, over the course of 2023 and the first half of the year. But the forwards we've put in place really provide for the funding for the parent financing needs at Covert, we have yet to roll out obviously a new 5-year plan, but the current plan of $14.3 billion that we're executing on. As you may recall, we've been very consistent in our comments about the equity funding needs being limited to 2025 and 2026, so about $250 million per year in those outer years. And because of the sale of the bank last year, there's no equity needs prior to that. And so we'll see what happens when we start to update the capital plan. And in addition to the comments Garrick offered on how we think about the capital plan, affordability is a constrained remind flu. The other one is financing, and we don't want to over lever over equitize the balance sheet. So we'll be mindful of that. And then obviously, just execution and feasibility of the capital plan of executing on the capital plan is the other thing we'll think through.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. The last point was always trying to get Thank you so much guys, I appreciate it .\nRejji Hayes: Thanks. Shar.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Hey. Good morning, Jermey. How are you?\nJeremy Tonet: Good, good. Thanks. Just want to talk a bit more on 2023 EPS guide here, if you could, the drivers. I'm just wondering if you could flesh out for us the contribution you can cover in '23. And when you're thinking about sales trends. What do you anticipate for sales trends for '23? How does that compare to kind of current trends? Just trying to get a feel for upside versus downside drivers within the guidance range?\nGarrick Rochow: Sure. I'll start, and I know Reg will offer some context around it as well. So again, I want to remind everybody, as I stated earlier here that it's 6% to 8% toward the high end, and we're pleased with that. And that includes Colbert [ph] As we've said, the Colbert strengthens and lengthens our plan here. And so when I think about this, this is again, we're playing a long-term game here, where we have this consistency and repeatability of delivering industry-leading financial performance. And so - that's how we're thinking about it as we move in 2023 and then even in the outer years. But Rejji, you walked through some of the specifics, please.\nRejji Hayes: Yeah, sure. So Jeremy, again, I appreciate the question. The Colbert acquisition, as we discussed, I think, in Q2 of this year, we anticipate that being about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS upside versus plan. And then the financing for the equity should offer $0.01 or 2 on top of that. And so that's all incorporated into the guide, as Garrick mentioned. And so we could spend more time on the details of that. But that's what's embedded in that 305 to 311 guide. With respect to sales, as you know, we plan conservatively. And so we're assuming as it pertains to weather, that clearly this year so far has been quite good. And so we would anticipate a little bit of a headwind just planning for normal weather versus what is a strong 2022 comp. On the non-weather side, we've been surprised to the upside really starting with the pandemic. And so we've just seen a nice bit of upside in terms of favorable mix with residential load, outperforming expectations the last couple of years. We'll plan conservatively and still assume that you see that pre-pandemic level of residential load. And again, I think we're seeing very good momentum on the commercial and industrial side, and we would expect that to carry on into 2023. And so those are the puts and takes with respect to Colbert and sales. The only thing I would add, just to just finish out on the drivers for 2023 is that clearly, we had a constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And so we should expect to see the benefit of that increase in rates, which went effective October 1 of this year, start to flow into the heating season in Q1 of next year. So for the first 3 or 4 months of 2023. And then we've got a pending electric rate case and anticipate a constructive outcome there as well. So those are kind of the primary drivers. You got Colbert, you've got conservatism on sales. You've got then the rate relief that we anticipate from constructive outcomes. Is that helpful?\nJeremy Tonet: Yes. No, that's very helpful. And I just wanted to pivot a little bit to battery storage, if I could. And just wondering if you could provide some more thoughts on how you think the system could potentially change over this decade, especially if renewable penetration ticks higher than planned from IRA benefits? And is there anything else you're watching out for on this front?\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Jeremy. That's a great question. So in our IRP we have 75 megawatts, and that has to take place in \u201824 to 2027. And we've already issued the RFP for that work. And so that's well underway. And so you'll see inclusion of that in our 5-year capital plan. But clearly, what is nice about this ITC and the flexibility that's offered within the IRA is you can have stand-alone solar. So typically, it's been coupled with solar. And so the ability to move storage around and have it be not just a supply asset, but have it be a grid asset, provides a greater amount of flexibility in how we use. And so you can see like the value stacking of a storage of lithium ion and other storage technologies. And so we look forward to that. We're going to continue to look at our 5-year plan, but also in the longer-term strategy and how we might accelerate or how we might think about differently the deployment of lithium I and other storage technologies. And I know Rejji has some comments on this as well.\nRejji Hayes: And Jeremy, the only thing I would add is it's important to remember that the IEP is iterative in nature. And so we'll be filing one for the stature at a minimum every 5 years, but our bias will likely be to file sooner than that. And so importance of that and the benefit of it is that as we see a potential descent in the cost curve, whether to Garrick point, it's lithium-ion or any other storage technology, we can incorporate new assumptions in upcoming IRPs.And so We\u2019re assuming in the full plan over the next 15 to 20 years, about 550 megawatts that Garrick noted the 75 megawatts in the short term. But it's a larger portfolio longer term. And again, if the cost curve permits it, we'll look to pull some of that forward and potentially expand it, particularly with the optionality provided with the ITC using it for stand-alone storage as well as opting out of normalization, which is helpful, too.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. And just a real quick last one, if I could. Just wondering what the potential impacts for rate payers could be should Palisade successful reopen? And does this change how you think about future customer savings should this transpire?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, I offer a couple of comments on Palisades. So if we get into technical questions, like we don't own the plant, we don't operate the plant anymore, and we no longer have a purchase power agreement, which was a significant savings for our customers and power supply costs over the course of the year. So technical questions and related questions that should be really directed to old tech or maybe the Department of Energy and the like. But bottom line, here's what we've shared with the Governor's office and with the Michigan Public Service Commission. We'll be open to a purchase power agreement. It has to be much more competitive and much more market-based than it has been historically. And we would expect financial compensation mechanism on that PPA as a new purchase power agreement. So that's really what I'd offer on Palisade at this point.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Makes sense. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Thanks for the time. Appreciate it, Listen, just maybe just starting \u2013 hey thank you. Just starting with preliminary, right? I want to focus on that work. Can you emphasize or can you can you piece apart why you used the word preliminary at the outset? What are the moving pieces in your mind, if we can go back to that quickly in terms of when you pivot to a more finalized guidance and what you're watching here in the next few months? I just want to clarify that.\nGarrick Rochow: Yeah, preliminary because we rebase off actuals, and that's the short of it. And so as we wrap up Q4, which, again, at year-end, I feel good about will deliver within that guidance range we've provided, and then we'll rebase off actuals. And so when I think about this year in this guidance, of course, we've tightened the guidance, raised the bottom end, which should be an indicator of confidence. I'm really thinking about the midpoint of that guidance. And again, managing the work. So imagine storms and other things that come our way that we typically deal with. And then we'll look for reinvestment opportunities also as we go through the remainder of the year. And those reinvestment opportunities derisk 2023 and ensure a path of success for 2023. And so that's how it will play out through the remainder of the year. I don't know if Rejji, you want to add to that?\nRejji Hayes: Julien, the only thing I would add in addition to just it's Q3 and we'll rebase off of actuals in Q4 and take into account any contingency deployment over the next couple of months. But the other variables is obviously we have a pending electric rate case, and so we'll have a little bit a couple of months more of visibility into how that's trending. We're certainly in the process of evaluating potential settlement. And so we'll see how things go there. And then at that point, we will have filed the gas rate case. And so we're still thinking through the size and implications of that, and we'll assume a constructive outcome there, but still some variables in place. So that's the other bit of information we'd look for as we establish our 2023 final guidance on our Q4 call early next year.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Okay. All right. Fair enough. Thank you. And then if I can just go back to the last question a little bit. Can you talk about how any revisit of a contract with Holtec and their Palisade could actually feasibly play to that vis-\u00e0-vis your IRP and/or RFP processes. Obviously, it's a little bit less than traditional, I get the DOE's involvement is also less than traditional. But I just want to rehash a little bit like how that would fit into your ongoing processes that are continually in flight admittedly of late have somewhat been crystallized at least in the near term?\nGarrick Rochow: The RF - so just for context, I know you know this, Julien, but for context for others on the call, there's 700 megawatts within this IRP that's 500 megawatts is dispatchable 200 megawatts of clean energy. That RFP has been issued. It was issued at the end of September. That's going to play out. It's done through a third party because of the potential for an affiliate transaction with the DIG. So that plays out. We anticipate those proposals to be submitted in the December time frame. Those will be evaluated again by the third party. That will take to February. And then we anticipate we'll have some direction in that in the May time frame. I'll likely share it at the May earnings call time line. So that's how it's going to play out. I do not know who will participate in that. Again, it's by a third party. Should Holtec choose to participate with the Palisades plant, and if it comes in at a competitive price, it may be an option out there. And again, because it's not an affiliate, we would earn a financial compensation mechanism or a return on that. So that's the approach that would be - would play out here over the course part of the next eight months.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. I know I can't comment too much on it, but I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Good luck.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDavid Arcaro: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You alluded to it, but just any latest thinking on the electric rate case and potential for settlement? And then I was just curious what timing you would be contemplating for the next electric rate case filing at this point? In terms of the gap between the rate cases here?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, just a little background, too. And so I was really pleased with the team. And we did a lot of work on this electric rate case to improve the quality of the case. And I believe and see it's evident in the fast position on that. It's a constructive starting point that they provided in August. And so as Rejji shared, we're looking at the potential for electric rate case settlement. And so that will continue until the case is final. We anticipate PFD in December and then a final order in February. So that's the current status. And then just the longer we have the opportunity we're a 10-month cycle. And so it will be in early in 2023, would we consider another filing another electric rate case. And that's a little far out for us in terms of - we got to want to see how this one plays out and make sure we're making the right investments for our customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks. And I was just wondering if you could give the latest in terms of what you're seeing in terms of cost pressures from inflation, whether it be labor materials components and just how that's impacting the O&M outlook here?\nGarrick Rochow: That's a great question. And I appreciate you started with our customers because that's a key piece. And so just let me give you a little fact here to this. And so, in 2021, we had $75 million of state, federal and some company funds that went to our customers. In 2022, that number was $79 million. And again, just for context, October to October as the fiscal year for state.\\ And so I'm really pleased that we've been able to get money in the hands of our customers. And you'll see from a quarter, our customers have a lower debt balance or bad debt balance on their bills. They're not carrying a big balance. And in fact, from an uncollectibles perspective, we're in a quartile 1 position. So I feel good because our customers are starting out in a better position. Now I'm certainly empathetic and sympathetic to their needs. And so what we know about our customers, when we look at their bill, about 80% of the gas bill is consumption. It's about 90% on an electric bill, we can influence that. We can influence that through our energy waste reduction, energy efficiency programs, and we are doing that. And that's great for our customers. In addition, we're about 30,000 thermostat - the thermostats or those that are most in need, vulnerable customers to help them, again, control the use. We're pushing again with nonprofits and other state and federal funds. And so our focus is clearly on our most vulnerable customers here in this time. And then broadly, as a company, and you asked the question really, have we seen material prices increase? Absolutely, 17% year-over-year. But there's a lot of things we're doing to mitigate that. particularly in the CE Way, $50 million of O&M waste reduction, $90 million -- approaching $90 million on a capital perspective. Our plants ran just again, they ran phenomenally - over the summer months. They got a low heat rate, gas and coal. MISO [ph] was bouncing all around the volatility of the market. Cars were steady state. We saved our customers $500 million year-to-date, \\looks like $700 million by year-end. Again, we used our gas assets, all these storage fields to help manage gas cost impact. So those are the here and now. And then we have a whole host of episodic cost savings $200 million Palisade for PPA, Palisade PPA [indiscernible] $30 million of OEM there. So IRA in that PTC, again, I can go on and on. But you can see we're squarely focused cost reduction for our customers, creating the necessary headroom so we make the right investments to improve the system again for our customers to manage that. And I know Rejji has even more to offer.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Derik, I think you covered all the key points on the cost side. The only thing I'll remind you, David, is that we're still looking at load opportunities as well. The announcement of Goshen from an economic development perspective, the global electric vehicle battery manufacturer out of China. That as we see it is the beginning of what is going to be likely a fruitful period of good economic development opportunities as a result of the good legislation passed over the past several months, the ship that NDRA that really created a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring really a good load opportunities, excuse me, to Michigan and that helps the equation as well. And I mentioned earlier some of the benefits of the IRA if it accelerates the tipping point for EV proliferation in Michigan that helps the load equation as well. And so we're looking at all the cost opportunities as Garrick enumerated, but we're also looking at top line as well to reduce rates.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. A lot of helpful points there. Thanks so much. And see you soon.\nRejji Hayes: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Miller from Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nTravis Miller: Good morning. Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning. Travis.\nTravis Miller: I was wondering you highlighted, obviously, the business load, the GC coming in, the industrial load. What does that mean in terms of mix of capital investment need or any kind of other need when you're thinking about distribution versus generation? Is that type of load something where you'll get more distribution investment to serve it or more generation type investments to serve it?\nGarrick Rochow: It's a little bit of both, but the immediate piece is really in the space of distribution. So these companies are located here, like if you take HSC as an example, or Hemlock Semiconductor they're building out that load right now. And so we're looking at the existing substation, how do we offer additional redundancy and build out. In the case of Goshen, again, they're constructing their facilities, so a little further behind from a start point. But again, you're going to be running electric line and build a substation dedicated to that facility. And so the first steps really show up in the distribution space for investments. And you'll see those as part of our 5-year capital plan to be able to, again, build and construct those. And then really there's a beautiful part of the integrated resource plan which continue to look out 20 years and balance the demand needs and the supply needs. And right now, we look long on capacity, really through 2031. So we have room to grow and add these investments. But as that - as Michigan continues to grow, and we continue to add low, we'll make adjustments as we move forward in our subsequent IRPs from a supply side. Is that helpful? Travis?\nTravis Miller: Yeah. That helps. It's exactly what I was asking. You answered everything else that I had to ask. So I appreciate it and see you in a couple of weeks.\nGarrick Rochow: Yeah, take care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Crowdell from Mizuho. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. Congratulations on a great quarter.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nAnthony Crowdell: And I apologize, this is real semantic I understand if you just want to ignore the question. But I think about - you talked about the IRP maybe strengthen and lengthen the CMS plan. And then when I fold over to earnings guidance of 6% to 8% towards the high end - if I look at '23 where it's kind of preliminary, it's right now at 7% more than midpoint. I guess I'm trying to reconcile 6% to 8% towards the high end. Is that just take 6% out of out of our planning assumptions? Or is 6% to 8% towards the high end/\nGarrick Rochow: I love your question. And I'm not going to ignore it. So let's answer it . I just go back in history a little bit, even pre Interbank. We guided at 6% to 8%, and we always said we had a bias to the midpoint. That's how we approached it. And now our language is definitely different. And it's 6% to 8%, and we expect to be towards the high end. And so that's the approach going forward. And again, we look for repeatability into that. And so as you saw in our 2023 preliminary guidance, it's off that midpoint of 2022, but we again, we're saying 6% to 8% expected to be towards the high end. We'll rebase off actuals, as we always do. But you can expect year after year that we're going to be consistency of industry-leading financial performance that we're going to continue to guide in that 6% to 8% range, again from the high end. That's what it offers. Is that helpful?\nAnthony Crowdell: Okay. Let's shot at it and then I'm finished. If I look back in the last 18 years, you guys delivered very consistent 7%. Do you view the performance when I look back '18 that you hit the high end of that 6% to 8% range?\nGarrick Rochow: I don't know what data you have in front of you, but I can only talk about what we have, we're in the context of the call here and our 2023 guidance. So we've said 305 to 311. And I would expect that we would be to the high end of that range. Is that clear it up I wouldn't anticipate the minute, but I would expect the upper half of that range.\nAnthony Crowdell: Perfect. Thanks and looking forward to seeing you in Hollywood.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Search. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Morning, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: Just wanted to ask on - just with your own renewables becoming more competitive post IRA, I think the current plan has 50% ownership in there. What is the CapEx associated with that? And if you were to be cost competitive across the board and go to 100%, what would that look like theoretically?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Michael, I assume you're asking about the full portfolio of 8 gigawatts. Is that fair?\nMichael Sullivan: In the current \u2013yeah, , either way, whatever is easiest for you. The current 5-year plan, the IRP that just got approved/\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. So for the 8 gigawatts, we've roughly quantified in the past that 50% ownership of that could be around $4 billion. But again, with cost curves reducing the way they are. And that was a pre IRA assumption. So presumably, it could be a lower amount of CapEx. But we would expect to own, as Garrick highlighted, greater than 50% over time, if we continue to see the cost of owning continue to be more and more competitive with the cost of contracting. And so we'll revise those estimates over time. In the 5-year plan, currently, we've got about $1 billion of solar in the plan. And obviously, we'll refresh the capital plan in the first quarter as we have our fourth quarter earnings call. next year. So we'll give an update then. But the current plan had about roughly $1 billion in it.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just kind of following along that, again, this is kind of theoretical. But if you start finding that you are more cost competitive more regularly here. Do you limit that at all if that introduces more equity needs into the plan?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So the current construct per the settlement agreement has a natural cap of 60%. And so it's effectively a collar from 50% to 60% for ownership. And so we wouldn't be able contractually to go above that now. But in subsequent IRPs, we could potentially earn more than that. And so we'll revisit it and particularly if we're cost competitive with contracted solutions, we'd like to think that ceiling potentially come off. But I would say Garrick highlighted this earlier, I emphasize it as well. When we think through the capital plan, the constraining factors are three things. It's affordability, so making sure that the rate increases are relatively modest as we execute on the capital plan. We also think about the feasibility of executing. We do not want to significantly grow our workforce to execute on the capital plan because that has structural cost implications. And so there's an operational feasibility aspect we take into it and then there's balance sheet. And we would rather not over equitize or over-lever the balance sheet in order to fund the capital plan. And so that's generally how we think about building out the capital plan, and we'll take that into account as we construct this latest capital plan that we'll provide in the first quarter next year and obviously, subsequent capital plans after that.\nMichael Sullivan: Thanks, Rejji. Super helpful.\nOperator: That concludes our Q&A session for today. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Maxine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look forward to seeing you at EEI in a few weeks. Take care and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, our third quarter results are a continuation of the strong performance we have delivered throughout the year, keeping us ahead of plan and positioning us well to achieve our financial objectives in 2022. To elaborate, year-to-date, we have delivered adjusted net income of $662 million or $2.29 per share, up $0.11 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, largely driven by favorable weather, including more normalized storm activity in our service territory and healthy economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 8 provides more details on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As Garrick mentioned, our solid year-to-date performance has driven our revised 2022 adjusted EPS guidance, which reflects an increase in the lower end of the range to $2.87 from $2.85. So our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance has now been raised and narrowed to $2.87 to $2.89. As noted, favorable sales continue to be the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance, largely driven by weather, equating to $0.13 per share of positive variance. Our strong sales were partially offset by planned increases in operating and maintenance or O&M expense, largely driven by customer initiatives, which are embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization to the tune of $0.03 per share of negative variance versus the first 9 months of 2021. It is worth noting that the aforementioned year-over-year increase in O&M expense was partially offset by lower service restoration expense versus the comparable period in 2021 as anticipated. Lastly, the $0.01 per share of positive variance in the final year-to-date bucket reflects higher non-weather sales of the utility attributable to continued strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, slightly offset by a drag of the parent from our preferred stock dividend and select regulatory items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our revised full year EPS guidance range. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a positive impact of about $0.08 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We're also assuming - we are also assuming $0.11 per share of positive variance versus the fourth quarter of 2021 attributable to rate relief associated with the October 1 implementation of new rates from our constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And these estimates are stated net of investment-related costs such as depreciation, property taxes and interest expense. In addition to said cost, our plan assumes increased O&M expense in the fourth quarter versus 2021 for key customer programs such as vegetation management, one of the most effective measures to reduce system outages. And I'll note that we're on course for a record level of vegetation management spend in 2022, given our focus on improving the reliability of our grid. We also expect to continue to benefit from normalized storm activity, which nets to $0.11 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021. To close out our assumptions for the remainder of 2022, we assume the usual conservative assumptions for our non-utility business and weather normalized load at the utility. We have also maintained a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance which when coupled with our non-utility and load assumptions equates to $0.17 to $0.19 per share, a negative variance highlighted in the [indiscernible] chart. As such, we have substantial financial flexibility heading into the final three months of the year, which increases our confidence in delivering for customers and investors in 2022 and beyond. Turning to our 2022 financing plan on Slide nine. I'm pleased to report that we have successfully completed our planned financings for the year with $800 million of debt issuances at the utility priced at a weighted average coupon of 3.9% which is well below indicative levels in the current environment. \\ And while our plan did not call for any financing at the parent this year, we opportunistically priced approximately $440 million of equity forward contracts during the quarter at a weighted average price of $68 per share. Our timely execution of the equity forward locks in attractive terms for the parent financing needs of the pending acquisition of the new covert natural gas generation facility. The settlement of the equity forward will largely occur in the first half of 2023 concurrent with the acquisition timing and in accordance with our recently approved integrated resource plan. Staying on the balance sheet. As we move into the winter heating season, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper. And needless to say, we'll continue to monitor market conditions to try to lock in attractive terms for future financing opportunities at the utility. Lastly, it's important to highlight that we have no debt maturities or planned financings at the parent in 2023 and virtually no floating rate exposure outside of the utility, which largely insulates our income statement from future interest rate volatility. Our opportunistic a prudent financing strategy reduces cost while limiting uncertainty in our cost structure, enabling us to fund our capital plan in a cost-efficient manner for the benefit of customers and investors. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Maxine to open the lines for Q&A. Yeah, sure. I would only add a couple of comments here. The other benefit, too, is just with the continuation of the tax credit for electric vehicles, well, that certainly could be a catalyst in accelerating the tipping point of electric vehicle proliferation in Michigan, and obviously, that would bring rate benefits as well because you're growing the denominator in that rate calculation, bring kilowatt hours into Michigan, which we would welcome. So there's a benefit there that should be, at some point, incorporated into our financials longer term. With respect to your question around financing, we are not presupposing any tax equity in our funding strategy. So the IRA, there's been a lot of talk about the transferability of credits. I still think there's more guidance required from the IRS and we'll see what type of market develops as a result of transferability of credits. We certainly do have credits so we can monetize at some point. But at the moment, we're not presupposing any tax equity in our financing assumptions. Yeah. So I appreciate the question, Shar. And just for Symantec, we haven't issued the equity yet. We just put in place forward contracts. And so we've locked in the price, we'll issue, obviously, over the course of 2023 and the first half of the year. But the forwards we've put in place really provide for the funding for the parent financing needs at Covert, we have yet to roll out obviously a new 5-year plan, but the current plan of $14.3 billion that we're executing on. As you may recall, we've been very consistent in our comments about the equity funding needs being limited to 2025 and 2026, so about $250 million per year in those outer years. And because of the sale of the bank last year, there's no equity needs prior to that. And so we'll see what happens when we start to update the capital plan. And in addition to the comments Garrick offered on how we think about the capital plan, affordability is a constrained remind flu. The other one is financing, and we don't want to over lever over equitize the balance sheet. So we'll be mindful of that. And then obviously, just execution and feasibility of the capital plan of executing on the capital plan is the other thing we'll think through. Thanks. Shar. Yeah, sure. So Jeremy, again, I appreciate the question. The Colbert acquisition, as we discussed, I think, in Q2 of this year, we anticipate that being about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS upside versus plan. And then the financing for the equity should offer $0.01 or 2 on top of that. And so that's all incorporated into the guide, as Garrick mentioned. And so we could spend more time on the details of that. But that's what's embedded in that 305 to 311 guide. With respect to sales, as you know, we plan conservatively. And so we're assuming as it pertains to weather, that clearly this year so far has been quite good. And so we would anticipate a little bit of a headwind just planning for normal weather versus what is a strong 2022 comp. On the non-weather side, we've been surprised to the upside really starting with the pandemic. And so we've just seen a nice bit of upside in terms of favorable mix with residential load, outperforming expectations the last couple of years. We'll plan conservatively and still assume that you see that pre-pandemic level of residential load. And again, I think we're seeing very good momentum on the commercial and industrial side, and we would expect that to carry on into 2023. And so those are the puts and takes with respect to Colbert and sales. The only thing I would add, just to just finish out on the drivers for 2023 is that clearly, we had a constructive gas rate case settlement earlier this year. And so we should expect to see the benefit of that increase in rates, which went effective October 1 of this year, start to flow into the heating season in Q1 of next year. So for the first 3 or 4 months of 2023. And then we've got a pending electric rate case and anticipate a constructive outcome there as well. So those are kind of the primary drivers. You got Colbert, you've got conservatism on sales. You've got then the rate relief that we anticipate from constructive outcomes. Is that helpful? And Jeremy, the only thing I would add is it's important to remember that the IEP is iterative in nature. And so we'll be filing one for the stature at a minimum every 5 years, but our bias will likely be to file sooner than that. And so importance of that and the benefit of it is that as we see a potential descent in the cost curve, whether to Garrick point, it's lithium-ion or any other storage technology, we can incorporate new assumptions in upcoming IRPs.And so We're assuming in the full plan over the next 15 to 20 years, about 550 megawatts that Garrick noted the 75 megawatts in the short term. But it's a larger portfolio longer term. And again, if the cost curve permits it, we'll look to pull some of that forward and potentially expand it, particularly with the optionality provided with the ITC using it for stand-alone storage as well as opting out of normalization, which is helpful, too. Julien, the only thing I would add in addition to just it's Q3 and we'll rebase off of actuals in Q4 and take into account any contingency deployment over the next couple of months. But the other variables is obviously we have a pending electric rate case, and so we'll have a little bit a couple of months more of visibility into how that's trending. We're certainly in the process of evaluating potential settlement. And so we'll see how things go there. And then at that point, we will have filed the gas rate case. And so we're still thinking through the size and implications of that, and we'll assume a constructive outcome there, but still some variables in place. So that's the other bit of information we'd look for as we establish our 2023 final guidance on our Q4 call early next year. Thanks, Julien. Yes. Derik, I think you covered all the key points on the cost side. The only thing I'll remind you, David, is that we're still looking at load opportunities as well. The announcement of Goshen from an economic development perspective, the global electric vehicle battery manufacturer out of China. That as we see it is the beginning of what is going to be likely a fruitful period of good economic development opportunities as a result of the good legislation passed over the past several months, the ship that NDRA that really created a once-in-a-generation opportunity to bring really a good load opportunities, excuse me, to Michigan and that helps the equation as well. And I mentioned earlier some of the benefits of the IRA if it accelerates the tipping point for EV proliferation in Michigan that helps the load equation as well. And so we're looking at all the cost opportunities as Garrick enumerated, but we're also looking at top line as well to reduce rates. Thanks, David. Yes, Michael, I assume you're asking about the full portfolio of 8 gigawatts. Is that fair? Yeah. So for the 8 gigawatts, we've roughly quantified in the past that 50% ownership of that could be around $4 billion. But again, with cost curves reducing the way they are. And that was a pre IRA assumption. So presumably, it could be a lower amount of CapEx. But we would expect to own, as Garrick highlighted, greater than 50% over time, if we continue to see the cost of owning continue to be more and more competitive with the cost of contracting. And so we'll revise those estimates over time. In the 5-year plan, currently, we've got about $1 billion of solar in the plan. And obviously, we'll refresh the capital plan in the first quarter as we have our fourth quarter earnings call. next year. So we'll give an update then. But the current plan had about roughly $1 billion in it. Yes. So the current construct per the settlement agreement has a natural cap of 60%. And so it's effectively a collar from 50% to 60% for ownership. And so we wouldn't be able contractually to go above that now. But in subsequent IRPs, we could potentially earn more than that. And so we'll revisit it and particularly if we're cost competitive with contracted solutions, we'd like to think that ceiling potentially come off. But I would say Garrick highlighted this earlier, I emphasize it as well. When we think through the capital plan, the constraining factors are three things. It's affordability, so making sure that the rate increases are relatively modest as we execute on the capital plan. We also think about the feasibility of executing. We do not want to significantly grow our workforce to execute on the capital plan because that has structural cost implications. And so there's an operational feasibility aspect we take into it and then there's balance sheet. And we would rather not over equitize or over-lever the balance sheet in order to fund the capital plan. And so that's generally how we think about building out the capital plan, and we'll take that into account as we construct this latest capital plan that we'll provide in the first quarter next year and obviously, subsequent capital plans after that."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'm pleased with the results for the quarter and the path to year-end. But before I get into specifics, I want to start with our simple investment thesis, which continues to stay on the test of time. You've seen this in our calls and meetings and you've seen the results. It works. This is where we put our words into action. We remain firmly committed to leading the clean energy transformation. As I mentioned on the Q2 call, the approval of our IRP was a proof point, evident that we have a clear pathway supported by the regulatory construct to deliver on our leading clean energy commitment. Our investment thesis is fueled by our commitment to eliminate waste, driven by the CE Way. I put us up against anyone in our ability to take cost out. This year, we are on track to take $50 million of O&M waste out of the business. The CE Way is critical to delivering our operational and financial performance and keeping our service affordable for our customers. Another critical element is our top-tier regulatory backdrop in Michigan. In Q2, we not only delivered our IRP, but we settled our gas rate case. And in this quarter, we received constructive feedback on our pending electric rate case, further evidence of the health of the Michigan regulatory environment. A key part of our investment thesis, which we don't talk about enough is our diverse and attractive service territory. I'm excited about both the pace and impact of new growth in Michigan. Just this month, our governor announced that Goshen, a global electric vehicle battery manufacturer selected Michigan for its U.S. expansion over many other states, highlighting another example of onshoring manufacturing within the state. This project is expected to add over 2,000 jobs and provide $2.4 billion of investment. In August, President Biden joined Governor Whitmer at Hemlock Semiconductor headquartered here in the heart of our service territory. Together, they announced an executive directive to guide the implementation of the CHIPS Act, which will boost domestic chip production and bolster Michigan's leadership in the semiconductor industry. Let me put that into perspective. Hemlock is one of the largest polysilicon manufacturers in the world. Nearly one third of the world's ships are made from polysilicon produced at that facility right here in Michigan. In September, Hemlock announced plans to grow its operation. The project is expected to add 170 jobs and $375 million of investment in the state. Ground has already been broken on the expansion. Also the expansion of SK Siltron, now in operation, a semiconductor wafer manufacturer bringing 150 jobs and over $300 million of investment to the state. These are highlights over the quarter. From the map on the slide, you can see we secured over 80 agreements year-to-date, which translates to roughly 200 megawatts of new or expanding load in our service territory. This growth is bolstered by collaborative and innovative economic development efforts, supported by competitive rates for energy-intensive customers and robust policy, which are working and continue to drive growth. Our work with the Governor's office, the legislature, Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the commission has made it possible for Michigan to not only compete, but win investment and new jobs. These economic tailwinds are just a few of many we've seen and continue to see across Michigan that will help attract more business. grow industrial, commercial and residential load and ultimately provide long-term bill relief for all our customers. Our strong commitment to decarbonize both our gas and electric systems is a key differentiator for CMS Energy. The recently passed Inflation Reduction Act is another catalyst for our clean energy transformation, supporting deployment of renewables and lowering costs for our customers. We see a lot of benefit in this new legislation. The extension of tax credits for both wind and solar provide economic certainty and lowers cost for our robust renewal backlog within our IRP which includes 8 gigawatts of solar, as well as the remaining 200 megawatts of wind, we are constructing to meet Michigan's renewable portfolio standard. Production tax credits for solar projects will drive cost competitiveness for utility-owned projects versus PPAs. As we build scale, this cost competitiveness has enabled us to own in rate base a greater portion of future IRP solar investment. The investment tax credit for storage will lower cost and provide greater flexibility as we're able to site storage strategically across the grid. Our IRP includes 75 megawatts of battery storage, beginning in 2024, and could accelerate or increase the 550 megawatts of battery storage through 2040. These tax advantages reduce the cost of new solar roughly 15%, providing annual cost savings of $60 million versus our plan. Also, with the use of tax deductions and credit, we do not expect a material impact in the alternative minimum tax through the remainder of the decade. All of this helps our customers with more savings. It's a supports our commitment to grow Michigan. It drives the transformation to clean energy and our growing voluntary green pricing program. Bottom line, this legislation is a great tailwind across the board. Now let's get into the numbers. Year-to-date, we've delivered $2.29 of adjusted earnings per share and remain ahead of plan. With confidence in this year, we're raising the bottom end of our guidance to $2.87 to $2.89 per share from $2.85 to $2.89 per share. For 2023, we are initiating our full year preliminary guidance of $3.05 to $3.11 per share, which reflects 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of our revised 2022 guidance, and we expect to be toward the high end of that range. And remember, we've always rebase our guidance of actual compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. Our long-term dividend growth remains at 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time. We'll provide you with an update on our guidance, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call early next year. Lastly, we are confident in both our outlook and our ability to deliver our financial and operational targets for the remainder of the year, which brings me to my last slide. In a few weeks, Michigan will have elections across the state. New people will join the legislature. We'll also see the results of the race for governor. Whatever the outcome, we will work effectively as we have for a decade with whoever holds off it. You've heard us say it before. We deliver regardless of conditions, nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance. You can count on CMS Energy for that. Now I'll turn the call over to Rejji to offer additional detail. Yes. Thanks, Insoo, for your question. A couple of things on this. I think it's important to understand, particularly in August here had some storm. We performed well during the storm. But again, it's catching a little media attention. And I think one of the things that's really important to recognize here in Michigan is the impacts the great Lakes and what Lake Michigan does to the weather and storms. And then also just a longer-term trend we see is increasing wind speeds across Michigan in part due to climate change. And the bottom line is we see a real investment opportunity and resiliency. The commission has been supportive of many of the reliability and resiliency efforts in our electric rate case, but there's more to do. There's more to do in this space. And so I really view this as a collaboration where we can work to. Again, I think we're both the commission and the company are well aligned here in what we need to do in terms of reliability and resiliency. So I really view it as an opportunity where those opportunities are and create the path to improve that for our customers. There is a first effort that's due here in November 4th. I would imagine the audit takes place over much of the fiscal year of 2023. And again, I see that as a collaborative effort. We want the same thing. We have the same goal, and it's really aligned to make sure we have all the right measures and investments in place to achieve that goal and they're at the right speed and pacing. Yeah. The short answer is yes, on Covert and the financing is in that piece. But I'm going to just step back and think of the bigger picture here. And so how I think about this and how we think about this as a company. So this guidance here is 6% to 8%, and we expect toward the high end. We really think that offers a premium across the sector. And we've been doing this for 20 years of industry-leading financial performance. And then I think what's unique about us, and again, differentiates us and there's a strength and frankly, a premium is that we rebase off of actual. So we do this time and time again. And so we're not in the sugar highs. It's a long-term play where we're going to continue to deliver towards the high end. So I feel good. We feel good about the guidance we've offered here today at 305 to 311 and one more thing on this. I want to make sure everyone understands, too, that this is an important balance, a balance of our customers, other stakeholders like regulators and legislators as well as you, our investors. Hey, good morning, Shar.\\ I'll tag team this with Rejji here. This IRA is really beneficial for our industry and beneficial for our customers. And so as you know, we've laid out our IRP to 8 gigawatts, the storage build, it's a nice plan. And we go in every three to five years to revise that. And so in the short term, I really see the benefit of the IRA in this production tax credit flowing right to our customers. That's the $60 million per year versus plan. So that, again, keeps our customers' costs low, frankly. And remember, this IRP had $600 million of savings already baked in over that, and this is incremental to that. So again, feel good about that. In respect to my other comments, we'll file, refile our IRP in three to five years. And with this - with the IRA, there's upside opportunities in terms of our tailwind opportunities in terms of pulling renewables forward, potentially Poland storage forward. We'll have to take a look at that. Again, I see this as a real advantage to utility-owned solar and storage versus PPAs. I know Rejji, you may have additional comments. Yeah. I don't think you have to wait until the IRP filing for that. It's really a function of how we build out our capital plan. And as we've shared historically, we look at what the customer can afford. We look at how can we execute work, we look at the business cases, we look at the mix, where we put in dollars strategically. So there's a bottom-up buildup for that capital plan. And so as we're able to create more headroom or as - we have, in the case of afford [ph] of the bills, we'll look at how do we put those important capital investments into the system that ultimately provide value for our customers. And so that's the balance will strike. And you'll see it as it plays out here in our Q4 call in the 5-year capital. Hey. Good morning, Jermey. How are you? Sure. I'll start, and I know Reg will offer some context around it as well. So again, I want to remind everybody, as I stated earlier here that it's 6% to 8% toward the high end, and we're pleased with that. And that includes Colbert [ph] As we've said, the Colbert strengthens and lengthens our plan here. And so when I think about this, this is again, we're playing a long-term game here, where we have this consistency and repeatability of delivering industry-leading financial performance. And so - that's how we're thinking about it as we move in 2023 and then even in the outer years. But Rejji, you walked through some of the specifics, please. Thanks, Jeremy. That's a great question. So in our IRP we have 75 megawatts, and that has to take place in \u201824 to 2027. And we've already issued the RFP for that work. And so that's well underway. And so you'll see inclusion of that in our 5-year capital plan. But clearly, what is nice about this ITC and the flexibility that's offered within the IRA is you can have stand-alone solar. So typically, it's been coupled with solar. And so the ability to move storage around and have it be not just a supply asset, but have it be a grid asset, provides a greater amount of flexibility in how we use. And so you can see like the value stacking of a storage of lithium ion and other storage technologies. And so we look forward to that. We're going to continue to look at our 5-year plan, but also in the longer-term strategy and how we might accelerate or how we might think about differently the deployment of lithium I and other storage technologies. And I know Rejji has some comments on this as well. Well, I offer a couple of comments on Palisades. So if we get into technical questions, like we don't own the plant, we don't operate the plant anymore, and we no longer have a purchase power agreement, which was a significant savings for our customers and power supply costs over the course of the year. So technical questions and related questions that should be really directed to old tech or maybe the Department of Energy and the like. But bottom line, here's what we've shared with the Governor's office and with the Michigan Public Service Commission. We'll be open to a purchase power agreement. It has to be much more competitive and much more market-based than it has been historically. And we would expect financial compensation mechanism on that PPA as a new purchase power agreement. So that's really what I'd offer on Palisade at this point. Thanks, Jeremy. Yeah, preliminary because we rebase off actuals, and that's the short of it. And so as we wrap up Q4, which, again, at year-end, I feel good about will deliver within that guidance range we've provided, and then we'll rebase off actuals. And so when I think about this year in this guidance, of course, we've tightened the guidance, raised the bottom end, which should be an indicator of confidence. I'm really thinking about the midpoint of that guidance. And again, managing the work. So imagine storms and other things that come our way that we typically deal with. And then we'll look for reinvestment opportunities also as we go through the remainder of the year. And those reinvestment opportunities derisk 2023 and ensure a path of success for 2023. And so that's how it will play out through the remainder of the year. I don't know if Rejji, you want to add to that? The RF - so just for context, I know you know this, Julien, but for context for others on the call, there's 700 megawatts within this IRP that's 500 megawatts is dispatchable 200 megawatts of clean energy. That RFP has been issued. It was issued at the end of September. That's going to play out. It's done through a third party because of the potential for an affiliate transaction with the DIG. So that plays out. We anticipate those proposals to be submitted in the December time frame. Those will be evaluated again by the third party. That will take to February. And then we anticipate we'll have some direction in that in the May time frame. I'll likely share it at the May earnings call time line. So that's how it's going to play out. I do not know who will participate in that. Again, it's by a third party. Should Holtec choose to participate with the Palisades plant, and if it comes in at a competitive price, it may be an option out there. And again, because it's not an affiliate, we would earn a financial compensation mechanism or a return on that. So that's the approach that would be - would play out here over the course part of the next eight months. Thank you. Well, just a little background, too. And so I was really pleased with the team. And we did a lot of work on this electric rate case to improve the quality of the case. And I believe and see it's evident in the fast position on that. It's a constructive starting point that they provided in August. And so as Rejji shared, we're looking at the potential for electric rate case settlement. And so that will continue until the case is final. We anticipate PFD in December and then a final order in February. So that's the current status. And then just the longer we have the opportunity we're a 10-month cycle. And so it will be in early in 2023, would we consider another filing another electric rate case. And that's a little far out for us in terms of - we got to want to see how this one plays out and make sure we're making the right investments for our customers. That's a great question. And I appreciate you started with our customers because that's a key piece. And so just let me give you a little fact here to this. And so, in 2021, we had $75 million of state, federal and some company funds that went to our customers. In 2022, that number was $79 million. And again, just for context, October to October as the fiscal year for state.\\ And so I'm really pleased that we've been able to get money in the hands of our customers. And you'll see from a quarter, our customers have a lower debt balance or bad debt balance on their bills. They're not carrying a big balance. And in fact, from an uncollectibles perspective, we're in a quartile 1 position. So I feel good because our customers are starting out in a better position. Now I'm certainly empathetic and sympathetic to their needs. And so what we know about our customers, when we look at their bill, about 80% of the gas bill is consumption. It's about 90% on an electric bill, we can influence that. We can influence that through our energy waste reduction, energy efficiency programs, and we are doing that. And that's great for our customers. In addition, we're about 30,000 thermostat - the thermostats or those that are most in need, vulnerable customers to help them, again, control the use. We're pushing again with nonprofits and other state and federal funds. And so our focus is clearly on our most vulnerable customers here in this time. And then broadly, as a company, and you asked the question really, have we seen material prices increase? Absolutely, 17% year-over-year. But there's a lot of things we're doing to mitigate that. particularly in the CE Way, $50 million of O&M waste reduction, $90 million -- approaching $90 million on a capital perspective. Our plants ran just again, they ran phenomenally - over the summer months. They got a low heat rate, gas and coal. MISO [ph] was bouncing all around the volatility of the market. Cars were steady state. We saved our customers $500 million year-to-date, \\looks like $700 million by year-end. Again, we used our gas assets, all these storage fields to help manage gas cost impact. So those are the here and now. And then we have a whole host of episodic cost savings $200 million Palisade for PPA, Palisade PPA [indiscernible] $30 million of OEM there. So IRA in that PTC, again, I can go on and on. But you can see we're squarely focused cost reduction for our customers, creating the necessary headroom so we make the right investments to improve the system again for our customers to manage that. And I know Rejji has even more to offer. Good morning. Travis. It's a little bit of both, but the immediate piece is really in the space of distribution. So these companies are located here, like if you take HSC as an example, or Hemlock Semiconductor they're building out that load right now. And so we're looking at the existing substation, how do we offer additional redundancy and build out. In the case of Goshen, again, they're constructing their facilities, so a little further behind from a start point. But again, you're going to be running electric line and build a substation dedicated to that facility. And so the first steps really show up in the distribution space for investments. And you'll see those as part of our 5-year capital plan to be able to, again, build and construct those. And then really there's a beautiful part of the integrated resource plan which continue to look out 20 years and balance the demand needs and the supply needs. And right now, we look long on capacity, really through 2031. So we have room to grow and add these investments. But as that - as Michigan continues to grow, and we continue to add low, we'll make adjustments as we move forward in our subsequent IRPs from a supply side. Is that helpful? Travis? Yeah, take care. Thank you. I love your question. And I'm not going to ignore it. So let's answer it . I just go back in history a little bit, even pre Interbank. We guided at 6% to 8%, and we always said we had a bias to the midpoint. That's how we approached it. And now our language is definitely different. And it's 6% to 8%, and we expect to be towards the high end. And so that's the approach going forward. And again, we look for repeatability into that. And so as you saw in our 2023 preliminary guidance, it's off that midpoint of 2022, but we again, we're saying 6% to 8% expected to be towards the high end. We'll rebase off actuals, as we always do. But you can expect year after year that we're going to be consistency of industry-leading financial performance that we're going to continue to guide in that 6% to 8% range, again from the high end. That's what it offers. Is that helpful? I don't know what data you have in front of you, but I can only talk about what we have, we're in the context of the call here and our 2023 guidance. So we've said 305 to 311. And I would expect that we would be to the high end of that range. Is that clear it up I wouldn't anticipate the minute, but I would expect the upper half of that range. Morning, Michael. Thanks, Maxine, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Look forward to seeing you at EEI in a few weeks. Take care and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at the time. [Operator Instructions] Just as a reminder there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through August 4th. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you Elliot. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm excited to share another strong quarter at CMS Energy and a great first half of the year bolstered by favorable weather and higher weather normalized sales at the utility, great tailwinds. And over the course of the quarter two outstanding regulatory outcomes, which provide further evidence of the top-tier regulatory jurisdiction in Michigan and give us continued confidence in our plan. First our integrated resource plan. If I could open this up for just a moment, 18 months of sophisticated supply modeling, thousands of pages of testimony, 10-month schedule, alignment across dozens of stakeholders from interveners, the attorney, general business stakeholders and the commission staff to reach a settlement with close to 20 parties. This plan approved at the end of June, solidly positions us to lead the clean energy transformation. Outstanding. Next our gas rate case. Important investments to ensure a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system, settled with many of the same parties and approved on July 7th, a $170 million increase. Over 95% of our customer investment approved. Excellent. Both outcomes demonstrate the quality of our regulatory environment in Michigan increase our confidence in delivering the rest of the year and our long-term plan. I want to emphasize why we continue to be confident in our plan. Delivering is not new for us. We have nearly two decades of commitments made and kept for all our stakeholders including you our investors. A key element in our performance is strong energy law in Michigan. We have a productive and solid energy law passed in 2008, which was enhanced and updated in 2016 both with bipartisan support. This allows for timely recovery of investment, which we've outlined through long-term plans such as our IRP, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution plans, which we filed in our rate cases. This coupled with separate mechanisms allow us timely recovery of fuel and power supply costs, as well as attractive economics on renewable energy investments and energy waste reduction programs and uniquely positioned Michigan as one of the safest places to invest capital. But let me be clear, we don't take this for granted. We continue to improve our processes for stakeholder alignment, testimony development and business cases so we are confident that our proposed customer investments deliver measurable benefit while keeping this affordable. At CMS we deliver, our productive and supportive environment and our deliberate approach ensures that will matter the condition. We are positioned to deliver industry-leading results. We remain committed to leading the clean energy transformation. On the solid foundation of strong energy law, we delivered and settled our IRP. This makes us one of the first utilities in the country to completely exit coal. As of the end of second quarter, we have nearly eliminated our long-term economic exposure to coal which is now less than 2% of property, plant and equipment. Not only have we reduced our long-term financial risk, but we've significantly mitigated our operational risk as well. The acquisition of simpler, more flexible natural gas units means fewer people to operate a better heat rate and less maintenance. The ability to quickly ramp up and down the dispatch of these units will allow us to flex with changing market conditions and to better support the intermittent nature of renewables. The acquisition of Covert combined with the RFP for 700 megawatts of capacity through PPAs the build-out of 8 gigawatts of solar in our ongoing energy efficiency and demand response programs ensure that we have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our customers. This plan improves reliability and limits our customers' exposure to potentially volatile, capacity and energy prices. The IRP strengthens and lengthens our financial plan, eliminates our exposure to coal, improves reliability and is a solid win for everyone. Strong execution and constructive regulatory outcomes lead to strong financial results, and I couldn't be more pleased with the first half of 2022. As I stated in my opening remarks, a strong quarter and a great first half of the year, where we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 for the quarter. We remain confident in delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 to $2.89, and we continue to guide for the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which as I noted is strengthened and lengthened by our IRP. We continue to guide toward long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time and we'll update our current $14.3 billion five-year customer investment plan on our year-end call to include the anticipated upside from the approval of our IRP. We are strongly positioned to deliver in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji, who'll offer additional detail.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you Garrick, and good morning everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a strong first half of the year are ahead of plan and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives over the next six months and longer-term. To elaborate for the first half of 2022, we delivered adjusted net income of $499 million, or $1.73 per share, up $0.09 per share versus our 2021 first half results largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 7 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As noted, favorable sales have been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.16 per share driven by weather. From an economic standpoint, we've continued to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed our plan assumptions and pre-pandemic levels. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses contributed $0.03 per share of upside, as we continue to benefit from our prior gas and electric rate cases. These sources of upside were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses largely driven by customer initiatives, embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization, which equated to $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the first half of 2021. We also note the $0.03 per share of negative variance in the final year-to-date bucket, which is primarily driven by investment costs related to the 2019 rate compressor station incident for which we are not seeking recovery at this time, as per our recent gas rate case settlement agreement, and the company's recent commitment to donate $5 million in support of income based bill assistance for our electric customers as per our IRP settlement agreement. These sources of negative variances are partially offset by the aforementioned strong non-weather sales performance in the first half of the year. As we look to the second half 2022, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our EPS guidance range. As Garrick mentioned, we had a constructive outcome in our gas rate case. The approved settlement agreement at $170 million significantly de-risked our financial plan, and when coupled with our December 2021 electric rate order provides $0.10 per share positive variance versus the second half of 2021. The forecasted rate relief net of investment-related costs in the second half of the year more than offsets our estimated impact of normal weather, which we assume will provide $0.01 per share a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2021. Moving on to cost savings. We continue to anticipate lower O&M expenses of the utility driven by the expectation of a more normalized level of storm activity this year versus the atypical levels experienced in 2021, which I'll remind you equated to $0.16 per share of downside in the third quarter of 2021 versus our financial plan. We also expect the usual solid cost performance driven by the CE Way as well as other cost reduction initiatives in motion. To close out our assumptions for the second half of the year, we assume normal operating conditions at enterprises given the outage at DIG in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the usual conservative assumptions for weather-normalized load at utility. Lastly, it's worth noting that we have accrued a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance as illustrated in the $0.24 to $0.28 of negative variance highlighted and the penultimate bar of the chart, which increases our confidence in delivering for you our investors. Moving on to the balance sheet. On slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from all three rating agencies. As you know we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position, which coupled with the supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating capital growth supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning to our 2022 plan financings on slide 9, we continue to plan for $800 million of debt issuances at the utility. And while our plan does not call for any financing at the parent this year we are currently assessing funding options for the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility in the first half of 2023 as per our approved IRP. As a reminder, the current financing plan for Covert assumes the issuance of hybrid securities. However, we're evaluating alternatives including using our existing ATM equity issuance program given the relative costs in the current environment. It's worth noting that this would be accretive to the previously provided $0.03 or $0.04 per share of EPS accretion attributable to the purchase of Covert and further strengthened our 6% to 8% long-term adjusted EPS growth outlook. Lastly, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper over the coming months. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before Q&A.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Rejji. I'll leave you with this. Nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance for you -- our investors regardless of conditions, administrations, political parties, economic environments even a pandemic, we deliver. Our strong legislative and regulatory construct, a robust capital runway, industry-leading cost management, conservative planning and our commitment to deliver across the triple bottom-line all of this makes for a strong investment thesis and makes us an investment you can count on. With that, Elliot please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Hey, Shar.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Garrick pretty clear-cut print here. But just given sort of the regulatory outcomes that are now secured like the IRP, the gas settlements, looks like the electric rate case is on track. As we're kind of thinking about maybe the cadence of updates is the plan to still update CapEx and financing in the fourth quarter? I guess just given the visibility we have why not provide a full guidance and capital update sometime in the third quarter or EEI time frame? I guess in other words given the regulatory execution that you've clearly highlighted today, could you provide early indication on growth 2023 numbers out of schedule?\nGarrick Rochow: Well first of all Shar thanks for the compliments. We are executing well and I'm pleased with the first half of the year. But we're still on plan for our Q4 call for our capital update. And let me offer a little color and context around that. Big reason for our execution and our ability to deliver year-after-year is one of the things we worked through with that capital plan. And that's from the bottom up. We're looking at every one of those capital investments to make sure it's going to offer the affordability and benefits to our customers. And so they'll stack on one another. We want to make sure that we're also able to execute on those. So that's a matter of understanding our workforce, the work lined up in a year and so that we're sure that we can deliver on that capital plan. And then you add that IRP yes, there's Covert, which is great visibility. But one of the other portions of that settlement was bringing in storage, battery storage 75 megawatts in the period of 2024 to 2027. So we've got to make sure that that's constructed and built into this five-year plan as well as \u2013 we've spoken in the past about Voluntary Green Pricing programs is additional renewables for some of our largest customers. And so that's materializing as well. And so that's another factor that's going in that plan. So we want to make sure that we can deliver on it. That leads to the success of our execution. And so that's why we're going to be putting out in Q4 \u2013 our Q4 call.\nShar Pourreza: Okay got it. And then just obviously, looking at the results year-to-date how 2022 is shaping up, July looks like a strong weather month. And obviously, you guys are \u2013 as you highlighted, you have normal weather planned for the remainder of the year. Does a strong third quarter weather push you ahead of guidance? And maybe what are sort of some of the offsets and moving pieces there that we should be thinking about because just looking at the results to date, it seems like you're well ahead of your numbers but...\nGarrick Rochow: Again, Shar we feel good about where we're at here at the first half of the year. But as you know, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan conservatively. Here's what I know in 2021, during the third quarter we lost $0.16 due to storms. We still delivered on 2021, but again, there's a lot of year left. And so we're prudent as we move forward. The other thing we look at is where are the opportunities to reinvest, provide benefit for our customers and investors as we move toward the end of the year. That helps to de-risk future years and again continues to strengthen and lengthen that long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% toward the high end.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Terrific. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks for the details.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, god morning. Just wanted to pick up a little bit I guess with the strong results here and it did seem like load performance was just better than expected. I'm wondering if you could provide a bit more commentary on that? And I guess do you see any of that abating or just kind of things in general from a load even absent weather a load growth perspective is going to continue at this pace, or do you see something stopping?\nRejji Hayes: Hey, good morning, Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we feel quite good about the load trends we're seeing in our service territory and I'll just remind folks on some of the specifics. And so we had residential down a little over 0.5%. So that's year-to-date versus year-to-date 2021 commercial and industrial. And as always our industrial excludes one large low-margin customer, up about 3% and then all in up about 1.5 points. And so we feel quite good about that. And particularly with respect to residential, we continue to see that good stickiness with the hybrid workforce, which likely will be a trend that continues on. And obviously that's a high-margin segment. And so relative to 2019 residential is up about a little over 2%. And so again that stickiness just really carries on. We continue to see from an economic development perspective, just good activity in the service territory. And obviously, with some of the news in D.C. yesterday, I would think that the CHIPS Act and some of the other legislative items that may be coming down the pipe could lead to more economic development opportunities or increase the probability of some of the stuff that is coming in Michigan's way or is in the prospects for Michigan. So very encouraged with the load trends and anecdotal again, we're hearing from our customers that they continue to feel good about the economic environment. So I feel quite good about the road ahead. And going forward again we continue to anticipate that you'll start to head back to those pre-pandemic levels. And so we would anticipate that from a residential perspective, but we continue to be surprised to the upside and commercial and industrial continue to trend very well. So that's our take on load at the moment.\nGarrick Rochow: And if I could just add, just a macro factor here and this is from the Governor's office. This year-to-date, $11.8 billion of investment opportunities announced in Michigan. Those are projects that have agreed to locate expand. There's actually 30 companies in all and 15,000 new jobs. And so that's from the governor's office here mid-July. And so still looks very robust here in Michigan we looked at from a macro perspective.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And then I just wanted to pivot a bit towards MISO. We've seen some capacity constraints there and that's led to some delays in equivalent retirements. Just wondering should we be thinking about any implications to CMS here or anything else that you want to share on this front?\nGarrick Rochow: I love our energy law. I really do. I'm not joking there. The 2016 energy law was here in Michigan was solid on the supply and demand side. And so when we go through an integrated resource plan, we've got to do all the modeling all the analysis to show that the supply and demand is going to meet and have some reserve margin on that. That's a requirement of a load-serving entity which we are. So I feel good about where Michigan is headed within MISO. And I can't speak for all of MISO, but I feel good about where Michigan is at. And I'll remind people -- remind all the people on this call that part of this IRP is to bring Covert in. Covert right now is in the PJM market and we're moving it over to the MISO market. That's 1.2 gigawatts of additional supply that's being brought into MISO and brought here to serve our customers. And so that's why we feel good about it. Our IRP we're still on pace and plan for retirement of all coal to be out of coal by 2025.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. Last one if I could hot off the press climate BBB package. Climate package being supported by management here. Any preliminary thoughts at this point?\nGarrick Rochow: Jeremy, you've given like what 12 hours to digest it all. Here's what I would say -- here's what I would say on it, because we've done some preliminary review and we're still digesting a lot of facts on it. Solar PTC is a big win in there and that's something we've been advocating for in Washington. We've been advocating the industry. Hats off to Rejji. Rejji has been making the calls with CFOs 1.5 years ago when it was first being talked about. And so we're excited about that portion of it what that means for 8 gigawatts. So it's going to be lower cost for our customers, as we build out more solar and it will provide -- put us on par with developers. So we like that. We know there's a storage ITC as well that will come into play in 2024 to 2027 as we build out 75 megawatts of storage. There's a lot of upside for the industry one of the birthplace of the automobile. I talked about the $11.8 billion. Most of that is in the automotive space. There's opportunities for load growth in the automotive business to grow as they make their transition. There's incentives in there for solar production in the US. In Michigan, one of our largest customers is the largest -- one of the world's largest producers of polysilicon crystals which go into solar panels and technology electronics. And so that's another -- and we see that as an upside. There's a big tailwind on EVs. EVs are a nice part of load growth. It's not in our forecast, but there's the continuing credits for purchase of EVs. And so there's a lot of good stuff in here. We're still digesting all the specifics but feeling good. Feeling good with coming out of the Senate. And of course, there's negotiations with the house in front of us.\nJeremy Tonet: Great. That\u2019s helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, everyone. Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Hello, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey, Garrick. Rejji, I wanted to go over to you on just the latest commentary on the potential looking at common equity for financing Covert. I think that was an $815 million project. Any sense of how much the equity could be and how materially the $0.03 to $0.04 accretion could change?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. I appreciate the question, Michael. I would say, we're obviously still evaluating options. You have the purchase price of Covert spot on at $815 million. And so as you know, our rate construct we would fund about half of that debt at the utilities to call it roughly $400 million, and the balance would be parent financing. And mathematically, that gets you to about $400 million, but we'll still consider what the alternatives might be. And obviously, we've got quite a bit of time to fund it. And so we'll look at our dribbling our ATM equity issuance program, whether that will be the full $400 million remains to be seen. And so we'll see how the price of other alternatives like those hybrid securities which for the past six to seven months or so have really priced quite competitively. And so if that changes over time, we may tranche it a little bit. And so I'd say, it's still early days, but we could go up to about $400 million. We've got that much on the shelf but we'll see how the pricing trends over the next handful of months. And then with respect to the accretion at this point, I'd say, it's a little premature to offer precisely how accretive it would be to the $0.03 to $0.04 that we initially provided because clearly that would depend on the price at which we issue equity, if we do choose to dribble. And so I'd say, more variables at this point to provide any prescriptive point of view, but it would be directionally accretive to based on the relative cost right now of our equity versus other securities.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay super helpful color. And then last question, what do you guys think about making it three for three with settlements this year with the pending Electric case?\nRejji Hayes: We'll, see. I mean I think betting at 670 still gets you into Cooperstown. So we've been encouraged with the IRP and the gas rate settlement, electric obviously, many more stakeholders many more variables. And we've been successful there before. So we're cautiously optimistic but early days, and we'll look and see where the staff is in about a month and we'll go from there. But I would say, early days to make any prediction at this point.\nMichael Sullivan: Great. Thanks a lot.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi, good morning. You guys really do execute. Always, always, so let me follow-up on this legislative angle, just one nuance here. AMT is just going to get a lot of attention to speak I imagine for all the utilities here. What are you guys saying on that? I know, we asked you for your hot takes a second ago, but just can rehash as best you understood your probably assessment of this last year if you will?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. So Julien just to be clear you're talking about the alternative minimum tax with respect to last night's \u2013 \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes exactly. The 15%.\nRejji Hayes: Okay. Yeah, with respect to climate bill. So, again as Garrick noted we're still digesting. I think it's about 700 pages, and our folks in federal affairs and on the tax side are really, really good at what they do and their fast readers, but 700 pages is a lot to digest in 12 hours. But I'd say, basically, what we've done so far as I understand it the structure that's contemplated is consistent with what we were talking about around EEI several months ago, where there's a three-year average on pre-tax operating income around $1 billion. And if you're below that threshold, you're not subject to the minimum tax. And so from our perspective given our size we would likely not chin that bar for some time. Now needless to say, we aspire to at some point because we're a growing company. But in the short term, I think, we'd be perhaps not subject to it initially. And we're still looking at -- again, if it's structured how it was when we were talking about this at EEI, you could apply tax credits through up to 75% of the tax liability. And again, we're still looking to see whether that's in the bill but that's how it was structured initially. And so I'd say, there's a bit more work to be done on our side before we can speak to it. But I'd say, to cut through it in the short term we don't think there's a significant impact on us again given our size. And if they apply that three-year average of $1 billion of pre-tax operating income we just wouldn't chin that bar for a little while.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, no that makes sense. Thank you for the hot takes there. Appreciate it. OPEB contribution to the quarter here, et cetera. Just curious, if you can comment here. Obviously, that subject has got some attention late broadly.\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. From a pension perspective, again, our story has been quite good for some time now. As you may recall, we have been very active in making discretionary contributions to our pension plan over the year particularly in years in which we were pretty flush from an OCF perspective. And so we're well overfunded. At this point, we're -- we have two pension plans and both are over 120% funded. Clearly asset experience is tough for most, but we have relatively low equity content in our pension plans. And I would say based on how our pension is structured at this point we're a bit more levered to interest rate movement. And with discount rates effectively going up year-over-year, we actually see it in the short term as a net benefit. And so we actually are seeing actually, a little bit of upside particularly since we recently remeasured our plan. So from our perspective, it's actually net positive at the moment and we feel quite good about the level of funding for the plan.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Totally. All right. So no material OPEB impact here in the quarter?\nRejji Hayes: No. No.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Thanks a lot. And then last one just a quick clarification from earlier on Solar TTC [ph] I mean clearly, benefits customers from an NPV perspective, but also I think implicitly also helps utilities participate from a rate base perspective as well, I take it?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So obviously, our rate construct is a little nuanced but it would help us as well because obviously it would allow us potentially, if you think about the 8 gigawatts of solar that we're going to be executing on over the next 15 to 20 years we're currently structured to at a minimum own about half of that. And if we can be more competitive, because of that benefit with the \u2013 obviously, the elimination of normalization then we could potentially pencil the own projects in a manner that's comparable with the PPA or contracted portion. And that would make a case for owning more than 50% over time. And so obviously, that could add to rate base opportunities. So we feel quite good about, what we've read today. But again, obviously more to digest.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Clearly, clearly. Okay. Thank you, guys speaking for him [ph]\nRejji Hayes: Thank you\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Your line is open. \nRejji Hayes: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Hi, good morning, guys. Two clarifying questions. First, is for 2022 did you say that the entire $0.24 to $0.28 negative red bar is conservatism? I know you said you're trending well and you've affirmed guidance. But did I hear you right, is that all conservatism? And second part of that question is, you mentioned the potential to accelerate O&M expenses through 2023. Have you started that yet, or are you waiting to get through the summer and the storm season? How flexible can you be to do that late in the year in other words?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Andrew, thanks for the question. I would say starting with that $0.24 to $0.28 a negative variance in the six months to go bucket of that waterfall chart on Page 7, that is a combination of conservative planning. And so that's really a catch-all bucket. And so we've got in their non-weather sales assumption year to go. We've got a little enterprises performance and so -- and some parent expenses. So there's conservatism, as it pertains to those variables, but the vast majority of that is just contingency that we've accrued, just based on the performance in the first half of the year. And so obviously, weather was -- has been a big help. It's offered upside to plan. We've seen a little cost performance as well and a little bit of non-weather upside. So sales have been strong as well as cost performance and that's, what's driving a good portion of that bucket. So it's really just where we've parked the contingency, which gives us a lot of flexibility which kind of segues into the second part of your question about what we're doing with respect to pull ahead. And so I would say, at this point because we still have six months ago, we really tried not to do a whole lot because we still have to get through storm season and see where Q3 is which not just from a store perspective, but also in terms of earnings contribution that's usually where we have the vast majority of our EPS contribution. So we've been cautious. We've done a little bit more with respect to forestry and we've done a little bit more reliability work. Obviously, we made some commitments as part of the IRP and gas settlements with respect to low income support. And so those are things we like to do, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for pull-aheads to de-risk 2023, some more going into the second half of the year. It's also important to remember, we also put in place a really nice regulatory mechanism a few years ago our voluntary refund mechanism, which effectively allows us to make decisions late in the year from an operational pull-ahead perspective get effectively the accounting benefit, in the current year and then a commitment to do work in the subsequent year. And so that gives us even more flexibility, as we head into the Q4 and deep into Q4, if we're seeing upside that's in excess of plan. It just gives us a bit more flexibility to commit to more work and again see the sort of accounting benefits of that in the current year. So a lot of flexibility going forward. We've made some moves to date from an O&M, pull ahead perspective. But again we're obviously, cautious at this point because we've got a lot of Q3 left and we're waiting to see what happens with storms and weather.\nAndrew Weisel: Great. Yes, that's definitely a helpful mechanism you have. And then the other question, I just wanted to clarify on equity. So I guess first question is, when would you decide how to finance Covert and could that be something like an equity forward to de-risked? And then just to be very clear, beyond financing that acquisition, are you still affirming no plans for equity in the general business financing?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. To answer the last question first, if you put aside the potential funding of Covert as we mentioned on the call today with potentially considering equity, there is no plan to issue equity beyond that until 2025, as per our initial guidance when we rolled out our $14.3 billion five-year plan in Q1 of this year. So we're still committed to not issuing equity through 2024 or more specifically until 2025, but for the funding of Covert.  And in terms of how we'll time that and how we'll think through that obviously we'll look at the valuation of the stock versus the relative cost of other hybrid securities and we'll look to be opportunistic from time to time. And we've seen just great pricing in the past with those dribble programs. And so, we'll look to utilize some of that. But again, I think we've got a lot of flexibility because we're not scheduled to acquire Covert until May of next year. So quite a bit of time to evaluate and we'll be opportunistic and dribble out so likely over the coming months.\nAndrew Weisel: Thank you very much. That\u2019s helpful.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning, thanks so much for taking my question. Good morning. I was wondering if you could just comment on how you see the equity ratio at the utilities trending over time after we saw it tick down a little bit in the gas rate case?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. David thanks for the question. Obviously, we would love to see equity ratios if not stabilize go the other way and go up because we do believe that we have yet to see a remediation from tax reform when it was enacted in 2017, which led to a 200-basis point degradation in our FFO to debt overnight, as well as cash flow degradation. And so, we're going to continue to make the case. In our cases that we filed that equity thickness should go up. And again, we'll make the case going forward.  And what I would mention is obviously in the case of the gas rate case settlement there were a number of stakeholders involved in that process we thought given the circumstances and all the other constructive aspects of the settlement. We were comfortable with the equity thickness where it was. But again, we still think it should be higher than that.  I think it's also important to note that we still have deferred tax flowbacks from tax reform where again we're giving back deferred taxes to customers. And that has the effect of skinning-in [ph] or reducing the 0 cost of capital component in our rate making capital structure which offset some of that reduction in the authorized equity thickness.  And so to be very specific here, our equity thickness in this gas settlement went down from a little over 52% to about 50.75%. So roughly 130 basis points of reduction. However, about 50 basis points of that was offset in our ratemaking equity thickness because of the 0 \u2013 the reduction of that 0 cost of capital layer. And so, again we'll continue to make the case. We still think equity thickness should continue to go up or should start to go up. And again, the onus is on us to make the case.\nDavid Arcaro: Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful color. And the other topic I was curious about was on the CGP. And could you talk about your progress there? And if you see a case for seeing momentum kind of accelerate in customer interest?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. We certainly see a lot of customer interest. We've seen some additional contracts over the quarter. Due to nondisclosure agreements, I can't talk about all of them. One of my pen-share [ph] is, the state of Michigan signed a contract over the quarter. And so, recall that's 1,000 megawatts of renewable build incremental to our plan. And so, we're starting to layer in those contracts as we move forward and have those customers secured.  In addition we look at -- went out to RFP to look at what would cost to construct that 1,000 megawatts. And again. I want to put it as a 1,000 it's going to come very module. It's going to come in little tranches as we build out for our customers, but still good interest -- really good interest and we continue to lap contracts to support that build. Is that helpful?\nDavid Arcaro: Okay Garrick. Yes. No that's helpful. Thanks. Maybe one more just quick one, to the extent out Rejji you were to do common equity or something with kind of 100% equity content here for Covert. Does that offset potential equity needs later in the plan just given the initial thinking was something with lower equity content 50% or so?\nRejji Hayes: So I'm just going to go back to what we committed to when we rolled out our five-year plan again, before the IRP and before Covert. So just so everyone's granted. So we said $14.3 billion of capital and we would not need to issue equity until 2025 and 2026 of the outer years of the plan. And at that point we would do about $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. So now with Covert, we said, we may dribble a portion of that. And I would say the funding of Covert, that's not going to eliminate those outer-year needs if that's specifically the question. So the $250 million we said we'd issue in 2025 and 2026, because we're issuing equity to fund Covert. Where we sit today we don't think that obviates the need to do that equity in those outer years. But we'll see I mean obviously we'll see what happens with respect to economic performance, load, EPS how much earnings we retain and so on. But again, from where we sit today this does not eliminate need for equity in those outer years.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks. Yeah was get met. Much appreciate it.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Levine from Citi. Your line is open.\nRyan Levine: Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Ryan.\nRyan Levine: Good morning. Hoping to follow-up on residential load patterns, it looks like your year-over-year residential load on a weather-normalized basis is a little bit softer than some of your peers in the neighboring jurisdictions. Curious, if there's any color you could share around the drivers of what you're seeing in your service territory?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. So our residential load to be clear Ryan, are you speaking about it you said year-to-date 2022?\nRyan Levine: Year-to-date and for the -- it seems like second quarter was a little bit better than first quarter, but curious what you're seeing.\nRejji Hayes: Yeah. So year-to-date, yeah, like I said about a little over 0.5% down versus year-to-date 2021 and then on a quarterly basis Q2 was a little about up about 25 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. And so as we said in the past, we've actually been quite pleased with what we've seen -- we've been quite pleased with what we've seen so far in terms of residential load. It exceeds our expectations. We assumed a much more aggressive sort of return to work or return facilities type of work environment in 2022. And we're still seeing pretty good stickiness in that hybrid work environment and still seeing pretty good load in the residential segment which obviously is higher margin. So it's exceeded our expectations of performance. I can't speak to the performance of others but we've been quite pleased with what we've seen being down only about 0.5% year-to-date. And again, I'll remind you, we're up over 2% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So the stickiness and resilience is still there and that's obviously offering favorable mix. I think it's also worth noting that we plan. And we'll continue to plan incredibly conservatively Ryan. And so when we see performance like that even though it's slightly down it's still offering upside relative to plan.\nGarrick Rochow: I just want to add on to this too, in both 2020 and 2021 we saw record interconnections service line connections with residential homes. And so record from a company perspective an annual perspective. And so Again, I can't compare that to what other utilities are seeing. But for us it's really nice residential load performance across our service territory.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate that. And then a follow-up on some of the kind of potential pull forward of 2023 costs into 2022 you highlighted forestry and a few other items. Curious, if you're seeing anything on the labor front may -- to combat some of the inflationary pressures and competition for labor that may lead to some elevated costs in the back half of the year?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, remember one of the -- just -- roughly 40% of our workforce is unionized and we have a union contract for those and those were signed in 2020. And that contract is a five-year contract that goes to 2025. And so there's some normal escalation. But you go back to 2020 when that contract was signed again we didn't see quite dis-inflationary pressure. And so again it's measured it's budgeted it's planned for. And so I'm not seeing much change there. Across our non-unionized workforce we've had roughly -- our retention rate -- we haven't seen the Great Resignation at all. And we've seen solid retention across the pandemic period. And so again we haven't had to go out and do a lot of hiring over the time period. And so that's been helpful too from a cost perspective labor perspective.\nRyan Levine: I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll now hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow, for closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks Elliot. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Take care. And stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you Garrick, and good morning everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a strong first half of the year are ahead of plan and are well positioned to achieve our financial objectives over the next six months and longer-term. To elaborate for the first half of 2022, we delivered adjusted net income of $499 million, or $1.73 per share, up $0.09 per share versus our 2021 first half results largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in the state. The waterfall chart on Slide 7 provides more detail on the key year-to-date drivers of our financial performance versus 2021. As noted, favorable sales have been the primary driver of our positive year-over-year variance to the tune of $0.16 per share driven by weather. From an economic standpoint, we've continued to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed our plan assumptions and pre-pandemic levels. Rate relief net of investment-related expenses contributed $0.03 per share of upside, as we continue to benefit from our prior gas and electric rate cases. These sources of upside were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses largely driven by customer initiatives, embedded in rates to improve safety, reliability and our rate of decarbonization, which equated to $0.07 per share of negative variance versus the first half of 2021. We also note the $0.03 per share of negative variance in the final year-to-date bucket, which is primarily driven by investment costs related to the 2019 rate compressor station incident for which we are not seeking recovery at this time, as per our recent gas rate case settlement agreement, and the company's recent commitment to donate $5 million in support of income based bill assistance for our electric customers as per our IRP settlement agreement. These sources of negative variances are partially offset by the aforementioned strong non-weather sales performance in the first half of the year. As we look to the second half 2022, we feel quite good about the glide path to achieve our EPS guidance range. As Garrick mentioned, we had a constructive outcome in our gas rate case. The approved settlement agreement at $170 million significantly de-risked our financial plan, and when coupled with our December 2021 electric rate order provides $0.10 per share positive variance versus the second half of 2021. The forecasted rate relief net of investment-related costs in the second half of the year more than offsets our estimated impact of normal weather, which we assume will provide $0.01 per share a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2021. Moving on to cost savings. We continue to anticipate lower O&M expenses of the utility driven by the expectation of a more normalized level of storm activity this year versus the atypical levels experienced in 2021, which I'll remind you equated to $0.16 per share of downside in the third quarter of 2021 versus our financial plan. We also expect the usual solid cost performance driven by the CE Way as well as other cost reduction initiatives in motion. To close out our assumptions for the second half of the year, we assume normal operating conditions at enterprises given the outage at DIG in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the usual conservative assumptions for weather-normalized load at utility. Lastly, it's worth noting that we have accrued a healthy level of contingency given our strong year-to-date performance as illustrated in the $0.24 to $0.28 of negative variance highlighted and the penultimate bar of the chart, which increases our confidence in delivering for you our investors. Moving on to the balance sheet. On slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from all three rating agencies. As you know we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position, which coupled with the supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating capital growth supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Turning to our 2022 plan financings on slide 9, we continue to plan for $800 million of debt issuances at the utility. And while our plan does not call for any financing at the parent this year we are currently assessing funding options for the acquisition of the Covert natural gas facility in the first half of 2023 as per our approved IRP. As a reminder, the current financing plan for Covert assumes the issuance of hybrid securities. However, we're evaluating alternatives including using our existing ATM equity issuance program given the relative costs in the current environment. It's worth noting that this would be accretive to the previously provided $0.03 or $0.04 per share of EPS accretion attributable to the purchase of Covert and further strengthened our 6% to 8% long-term adjusted EPS growth outlook. Lastly, we have preserved a strong liquidity position, which supplements our use of commercial paper over the coming months. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Garrick for some concluding remarks before Q&A. Hey, good morning, Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we feel quite good about the load trends we're seeing in our service territory and I'll just remind folks on some of the specifics. And so we had residential down a little over 0.5%. So that's year-to-date versus year-to-date 2021 commercial and industrial. And as always our industrial excludes one large low-margin customer, up about 3% and then all in up about 1.5 points. And so we feel quite good about that. And particularly with respect to residential, we continue to see that good stickiness with the hybrid workforce, which likely will be a trend that continues on. And obviously that's a high-margin segment. And so relative to 2019 residential is up about a little over 2%. And so again that stickiness just really carries on. We continue to see from an economic development perspective, just good activity in the service territory. And obviously, with some of the news in D.C. yesterday, I would think that the CHIPS Act and some of the other legislative items that may be coming down the pipe could lead to more economic development opportunities or increase the probability of some of the stuff that is coming in Michigan's way or is in the prospects for Michigan. So very encouraged with the load trends and anecdotal again, we're hearing from our customers that they continue to feel good about the economic environment. So I feel quite good about the road ahead. And going forward again we continue to anticipate that you'll start to head back to those pre-pandemic levels. And so we would anticipate that from a residential perspective, but we continue to be surprised to the upside and commercial and industrial continue to trend very well. So that's our take on load at the moment. Yeah. I appreciate the question, Michael. I would say, we're obviously still evaluating options. You have the purchase price of Covert spot on at $815 million. And so as you know, our rate construct we would fund about half of that debt at the utilities to call it roughly $400 million, and the balance would be parent financing. And mathematically, that gets you to about $400 million, but we'll still consider what the alternatives might be. And obviously, we've got quite a bit of time to fund it. And so we'll look at our dribbling our ATM equity issuance program, whether that will be the full $400 million remains to be seen. And so we'll see how the price of other alternatives like those hybrid securities which for the past six to seven months or so have really priced quite competitively. And so if that changes over time, we may tranche it a little bit. And so I'd say, it's still early days, but we could go up to about $400 million. We've got that much on the shelf but we'll see how the pricing trends over the next handful of months. And then with respect to the accretion at this point, I'd say, it's a little premature to offer precisely how accretive it would be to the $0.03 to $0.04 that we initially provided because clearly that would depend on the price at which we issue equity, if we do choose to dribble. And so I'd say, more variables at this point to provide any prescriptive point of view, but it would be directionally accretive to based on the relative cost right now of our equity versus other securities. We'll, see. I mean I think betting at 670 still gets you into Cooperstown. So we've been encouraged with the IRP and the gas rate settlement, electric obviously, many more stakeholders many more variables. And we've been successful there before. So we're cautiously optimistic but early days, and we'll look and see where the staff is in about a month and we'll go from there. But I would say, early days to make any prediction at this point. Thank you. Yeah. So Julien just to be clear you're talking about the alternative minimum tax with respect to last night's \u2013 Okay. Yeah, with respect to climate bill. So, again as Garrick noted we're still digesting. I think it's about 700 pages, and our folks in federal affairs and on the tax side are really, really good at what they do and their fast readers, but 700 pages is a lot to digest in 12 hours. But I'd say, basically, what we've done so far as I understand it the structure that's contemplated is consistent with what we were talking about around EEI several months ago, where there's a three-year average on pre-tax operating income around $1 billion. And if you're below that threshold, you're not subject to the minimum tax. And so from our perspective given our size we would likely not chin that bar for some time. Now needless to say, we aspire to at some point because we're a growing company. But in the short term, I think, we'd be perhaps not subject to it initially. And we're still looking at -- again, if it's structured how it was when we were talking about this at EEI, you could apply tax credits through up to 75% of the tax liability. And again, we're still looking to see whether that's in the bill but that's how it was structured initially. And so I'd say, there's a bit more work to be done on our side before we can speak to it. But I'd say, to cut through it in the short term we don't think there's a significant impact on us again given our size. And if they apply that three-year average of $1 billion of pre-tax operating income we just wouldn't chin that bar for a little while. Yeah. From a pension perspective, again, our story has been quite good for some time now. As you may recall, we have been very active in making discretionary contributions to our pension plan over the year particularly in years in which we were pretty flush from an OCF perspective. And so we're well overfunded. At this point, we're -- we have two pension plans and both are over 120% funded. Clearly asset experience is tough for most, but we have relatively low equity content in our pension plans. And I would say based on how our pension is structured at this point we're a bit more levered to interest rate movement. And with discount rates effectively going up year-over-year, we actually see it in the short term as a net benefit. And so we actually are seeing actually, a little bit of upside particularly since we recently remeasured our plan. So from our perspective, it's actually net positive at the moment and we feel quite good about the level of funding for the plan. No. No. Yes. So obviously, our rate construct is a little nuanced but it would help us as well because obviously it would allow us potentially, if you think about the 8 gigawatts of solar that we're going to be executing on over the next 15 to 20 years we're currently structured to at a minimum own about half of that. And if we can be more competitive, because of that benefit with the \u2013 obviously, the elimination of normalization then we could potentially pencil the own projects in a manner that's comparable with the PPA or contracted portion. And that would make a case for owning more than 50% over time. And so obviously, that could add to rate base opportunities. So we feel quite good about, what we've read today. But again, obviously more to digest. Thank you Hi, Andrew. Yes. Andrew, thanks for the question. I would say starting with that $0.24 to $0.28 a negative variance in the six months to go bucket of that waterfall chart on Page 7, that is a combination of conservative planning. And so that's really a catch-all bucket. And so we've got in their non-weather sales assumption year to go. We've got a little enterprises performance and so -- and some parent expenses. So there's conservatism, as it pertains to those variables, but the vast majority of that is just contingency that we've accrued, just based on the performance in the first half of the year. And so obviously, weather was -- has been a big help. It's offered upside to plan. We've seen a little cost performance as well and a little bit of non-weather upside. So sales have been strong as well as cost performance and that's, what's driving a good portion of that bucket. So it's really just where we've parked the contingency, which gives us a lot of flexibility which kind of segues into the second part of your question about what we're doing with respect to pull ahead. And so I would say, at this point because we still have six months ago, we really tried not to do a whole lot because we still have to get through storm season and see where Q3 is which not just from a store perspective, but also in terms of earnings contribution that's usually where we have the vast majority of our EPS contribution. So we've been cautious. We've done a little bit more with respect to forestry and we've done a little bit more reliability work. Obviously, we made some commitments as part of the IRP and gas settlements with respect to low income support. And so those are things we like to do, and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities for pull-aheads to de-risk 2023, some more going into the second half of the year. It's also important to remember, we also put in place a really nice regulatory mechanism a few years ago our voluntary refund mechanism, which effectively allows us to make decisions late in the year from an operational pull-ahead perspective get effectively the accounting benefit, in the current year and then a commitment to do work in the subsequent year. And so that gives us even more flexibility, as we head into the Q4 and deep into Q4, if we're seeing upside that's in excess of plan. It just gives us a bit more flexibility to commit to more work and again see the sort of accounting benefits of that in the current year. So a lot of flexibility going forward. We've made some moves to date from an O&M, pull ahead perspective. But again we're obviously, cautious at this point because we've got a lot of Q3 left and we're waiting to see what happens with storms and weather. Yes. To answer the last question first, if you put aside the potential funding of Covert as we mentioned on the call today with potentially considering equity, there is no plan to issue equity beyond that until 2025, as per our initial guidance when we rolled out our $14.3 billion five-year plan in Q1 of this year. So we're still committed to not issuing equity through 2024 or more specifically until 2025, but for the funding of Covert.  And in terms of how we'll time that and how we'll think through that obviously we'll look at the valuation of the stock versus the relative cost of other hybrid securities and we'll look to be opportunistic from time to time. And we've seen just great pricing in the past with those dribble programs. And so, we'll look to utilize some of that. But again, I think we've got a lot of flexibility because we're not scheduled to acquire Covert until May of next year. So quite a bit of time to evaluate and we'll be opportunistic and dribble out so likely over the coming months. Thank you. Yes. David thanks for the question. Obviously, we would love to see equity ratios if not stabilize go the other way and go up because we do believe that we have yet to see a remediation from tax reform when it was enacted in 2017, which led to a 200-basis point degradation in our FFO to debt overnight, as well as cash flow degradation. And so, we're going to continue to make the case. In our cases that we filed that equity thickness should go up. And again, we'll make the case going forward.  And what I would mention is obviously in the case of the gas rate case settlement there were a number of stakeholders involved in that process we thought given the circumstances and all the other constructive aspects of the settlement. We were comfortable with the equity thickness where it was. But again, we still think it should be higher than that.

And so to be very specific here, our equity thickness in this gas settlement went down from a little over 52% to about 50.75%. So roughly 130 basis points of reduction. However, about 50 basis points of that was offset in our ratemaking equity thickness because of the 0 \u2013 the reduction of that 0 cost of capital layer. And so, again we'll continue to make the case. We still think equity thickness should continue to go up or should start to go up. And again, the onus is on us to make the case. So I'm just going to go back to what we committed to when we rolled out our five-year plan again, before the IRP and before Covert. So just so everyone's granted. So we said $14.3 billion of capital and we would not need to issue equity until 2025 and 2026 of the outer years of the plan. And at that point we would do about $250 million per year in 2025 and 2026. So now with Covert, we said, we may dribble a portion of that. And I would say the funding of Covert, that's not going to eliminate those outer-year needs if that's specifically the question. So the $250 million we said we'd issue in 2025 and 2026, because we're issuing equity to fund Covert. Where we sit today we don't think that obviates the need to do that equity in those outer years. But we'll see I mean obviously we'll see what happens with respect to economic performance, load, EPS how much earnings we retain and so on. But again, from where we sit today this does not eliminate need for equity in those outer years. Thank you. Yeah. So our residential load to be clear Ryan, are you speaking about it you said year-to-date 2022? Yeah. So year-to-date, yeah, like I said about a little over 0.5% down versus year-to-date 2021 and then on a quarterly basis Q2 was a little about up about 25 basis points versus Q2 of 2021. And so as we said in the past, we've actually been quite pleased with what we've seen -- we've been quite pleased with what we've seen so far in terms of residential load. It exceeds our expectations. We assumed a much more aggressive sort of return to work or return facilities type of work environment in 2022. And we're still seeing pretty good stickiness in that hybrid work environment and still seeing pretty good load in the residential segment which obviously is higher margin. So it's exceeded our expectations of performance. I can't speak to the performance of others but we've been quite pleased with what we've seen being down only about 0.5% year-to-date. And again, I'll remind you, we're up over 2% versus where we were pre-pandemic. So the stickiness and resilience is still there and that's obviously offering favorable mix. I think it's also worth noting that we plan. And we'll continue to plan incredibly conservatively Ryan. And so when we see performance like that even though it's slightly down it's still offering upside relative to plan."

            "content": "Thanks Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. I'm excited to share another strong quarter at CMS Energy and a great first half of the year bolstered by favorable weather and higher weather normalized sales at the utility, great tailwinds. And over the course of the quarter two outstanding regulatory outcomes, which provide further evidence of the top-tier regulatory jurisdiction in Michigan and give us continued confidence in our plan. First our integrated resource plan. If I could open this up for just a moment, 18 months of sophisticated supply modeling, thousands of pages of testimony, 10-month schedule, alignment across dozens of stakeholders from interveners, the attorney, general business stakeholders and the commission staff to reach a settlement with close to 20 parties. This plan approved at the end of June, solidly positions us to lead the clean energy transformation. Outstanding. Next our gas rate case. Important investments to ensure a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system, settled with many of the same parties and approved on July 7th, a $170 million increase. Over 95% of our customer investment approved. Excellent. Both outcomes demonstrate the quality of our regulatory environment in Michigan increase our confidence in delivering the rest of the year and our long-term plan. I want to emphasize why we continue to be confident in our plan. Delivering is not new for us. We have nearly two decades of commitments made and kept for all our stakeholders including you our investors. A key element in our performance is strong energy law in Michigan. We have a productive and solid energy law passed in 2008, which was enhanced and updated in 2016 both with bipartisan support. This allows for timely recovery of investment, which we've outlined through long-term plans such as our IRP, as well as our electric and natural gas distribution plans, which we filed in our rate cases. This coupled with separate mechanisms allow us timely recovery of fuel and power supply costs, as well as attractive economics on renewable energy investments and energy waste reduction programs and uniquely positioned Michigan as one of the safest places to invest capital. But let me be clear, we don't take this for granted. We continue to improve our processes for stakeholder alignment, testimony development and business cases so we are confident that our proposed customer investments deliver measurable benefit while keeping this affordable. At CMS we deliver, our productive and supportive environment and our deliberate approach ensures that will matter the condition. We are positioned to deliver industry-leading results. We remain committed to leading the clean energy transformation. On the solid foundation of strong energy law, we delivered and settled our IRP. This makes us one of the first utilities in the country to completely exit coal. As of the end of second quarter, we have nearly eliminated our long-term economic exposure to coal which is now less than 2% of property, plant and equipment. Not only have we reduced our long-term financial risk, but we've significantly mitigated our operational risk as well. The acquisition of simpler, more flexible natural gas units means fewer people to operate a better heat rate and less maintenance. The ability to quickly ramp up and down the dispatch of these units will allow us to flex with changing market conditions and to better support the intermittent nature of renewables. The acquisition of Covert combined with the RFP for 700 megawatts of capacity through PPAs the build-out of 8 gigawatts of solar in our ongoing energy efficiency and demand response programs ensure that we have sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our customers. This plan improves reliability and limits our customers' exposure to potentially volatile, capacity and energy prices. The IRP strengthens and lengthens our financial plan, eliminates our exposure to coal, improves reliability and is a solid win for everyone. Strong execution and constructive regulatory outcomes lead to strong financial results, and I couldn't be more pleased with the first half of 2022. As I stated in my opening remarks, a strong quarter and a great first half of the year, where we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.53 for the quarter. We remain confident in delivering full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.85 to $2.89, and we continue to guide for the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which as I noted is strengthened and lengthened by our IRP. We continue to guide toward long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a targeted payout ratio of about 60% over time and we'll update our current $14.3 billion five-year customer investment plan on our year-end call to include the anticipated upside from the approval of our IRP. We are strongly positioned to deliver in the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rejji, who'll offer additional detail. Thanks, Rejji. I'll leave you with this. Nearly two decades of industry-leading financial performance for you -- our investors regardless of conditions, administrations, political parties, economic environments even a pandemic, we deliver. Our strong legislative and regulatory construct, a robust capital runway, industry-leading cost management, conservative planning and our commitment to deliver across the triple bottom-line all of this makes for a strong investment thesis and makes us an investment you can count on. With that, Elliot please open the lines for Q&A. Hey, Shar. Well first of all Shar thanks for the compliments. We are executing well and I'm pleased with the first half of the year. But we're still on plan for our Q4 call for our capital update. And let me offer a little color and context around that. Big reason for our execution and our ability to deliver year-after-year is one of the things we worked through with that capital plan. And that's from the bottom up. We're looking at every one of those capital investments to make sure it's going to offer the affordability and benefits to our customers. And so they'll stack on one another. We want to make sure that we're also able to execute on those. So that's a matter of understanding our workforce, the work lined up in a year and so that we're sure that we can deliver on that capital plan. And then you add that IRP yes, there's Covert, which is great visibility. But one of the other portions of that settlement was bringing in storage, battery storage 75 megawatts in the period of 2024 to 2027. So we've got to make sure that that's constructed and built into this five-year plan as well as \u2013 we've spoken in the past about Voluntary Green Pricing programs is additional renewables for some of our largest customers. And so that's materializing as well. And so that's another factor that's going in that plan. So we want to make sure that we can deliver on it. That leads to the success of our execution. And so that's why we're going to be putting out in Q4 \u2013 our Q4 call. Again, Shar we feel good about where we're at here at the first half of the year. But as you know, and as I said in my prepared remarks, we plan conservatively. Here's what I know in 2021, during the third quarter we lost $0.16 due to storms. We still delivered on 2021, but again, there's a lot of year left. And so we're prudent as we move forward. The other thing we look at is where are the opportunities to reinvest, provide benefit for our customers and investors as we move toward the end of the year. That helps to de-risk future years and again continues to strengthen and lengthen that long-term EPS growth rate of 6% to 8% toward the high end. Good morning, Jeremy. And if I could just add, just a macro factor here and this is from the Governor's office. This year-to-date, $11.8 billion of investment opportunities announced in Michigan. Those are projects that have agreed to locate expand. There's actually 30 companies in all and 15,000 new jobs. And so that's from the governor's office here mid-July. And so still looks very robust here in Michigan we looked at from a macro perspective. I love our energy law. I really do. I'm not joking there. The 2016 energy law was here in Michigan was solid on the supply and demand side. And so when we go through an integrated resource plan, we've got to do all the modeling all the analysis to show that the supply and demand is going to meet and have some reserve margin on that. That's a requirement of a load-serving entity which we are. So I feel good about where Michigan is headed within MISO. And I can't speak for all of MISO, but I feel good about where Michigan is at. And I'll remind people -- remind all the people on this call that part of this IRP is to bring Covert in. Covert right now is in the PJM market and we're moving it over to the MISO market. That's 1.2 gigawatts of additional supply that's being brought into MISO and brought here to serve our customers. And so that's why we feel good about it. Our IRP we're still on pace and plan for retirement of all coal to be out of coal by 2025. Jeremy, you've given like what 12 hours to digest it all. Here's what I would say -- here's what I would say on it, because we've done some preliminary review and we're still digesting a lot of facts on it. Solar PTC is a big win in there and that's something we've been advocating for in Washington. We've been advocating the industry. Hats off to Rejji. Rejji has been making the calls with CFOs 1.5 years ago when it was first being talked about. And so we're excited about that portion of it what that means for 8 gigawatts. So it's going to be lower cost for our customers, as we build out more solar and it will provide -- put us on par with developers. So we like that. We know there's a storage ITC as well that will come into play in 2024 to 2027 as we build out 75 megawatts of storage. There's a lot of upside for the industry one of the birthplace of the automobile. I talked about the $11.8 billion. Most of that is in the automotive space. There's opportunities for load growth in the automotive business to grow as they make their transition. There's incentives in there for solar production in the US. In Michigan, one of our largest customers is the largest -- one of the world's largest producers of polysilicon crystals which go into solar panels and technology electronics. And so that's another -- and we see that as an upside. There's a big tailwind on EVs. EVs are a nice part of load growth. It's not in our forecast, but there's the continuing credits for purchase of EVs. And so there's a lot of good stuff in here. We're still digesting all the specifics but feeling good. Feeling good with coming out of the Senate. And of course, there's negotiations with the house in front of us. Hello, Michael. Yes. We certainly see a lot of customer interest. We've seen some additional contracts over the quarter. Due to nondisclosure agreements, I can't talk about all of them. One of my pen-share [ph] is, the state of Michigan signed a contract over the quarter. And so, recall that's 1,000 megawatts of renewable build incremental to our plan. And so, we're starting to layer in those contracts as we move forward and have those customers secured.  In addition we look at -- went out to RFP to look at what would cost to construct that 1,000 megawatts. And again. I want to put it as a 1,000 it's going to come very module. It's going to come in little tranches as we build out for our customers, but still good interest -- really good interest and we continue to lap contracts to support that build. Is that helpful? Thanks. Good morning, Ryan. I just want to add on to this too, in both 2020 and 2021 we saw record interconnections service line connections with residential homes. And so record from a company perspective an annual perspective. And so Again, I can't compare that to what other utilities are seeing. But for us it's really nice residential load performance across our service territory. Well, remember one of the -- just -- roughly 40% of our workforce is unionized and we have a union contract for those and those were signed in 2020. And that contract is a five-year contract that goes to 2025. And so there's some normal escalation. But you go back to 2020 when that contract was signed again we didn't see quite dis-inflationary pressure. And so again it's measured it's budgeted it's planned for. And so I'm not seeing much change there. Across our non-unionized workforce we've had roughly -- our retention rate -- we haven't seen the Great Resignation at all. And we've seen solid retention across the pandemic period. And so again we haven't had to go out and do a lot of hiring over the time period. And so that's been helpful too from a cost perspective labor perspective. Thanks Elliot. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Take care. And stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 10. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.  At this time, I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  This presentation contains forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I'm pleased to share the great progress we have made over the quarter and with our IRP.  You've heard me speak about our simple investment thesis on many of these calls. It has withstood the test of time, and this quarter was no different. The industry leading at 0 commitments. These aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. Our IRP settlement paves the way to be out of coal by 2025, one of the first utilities in the nation to achieve such a milestone. Our recently announced net 0 goal for our gas system, not just a dream but evident and proof point in our net 0 methane target and a 20% reduction in customer emissions by 2030.  Excellent through the CE way. I can't think of a more important time given inflation and supply chain constraints for our industry-leading cost management muscle will play out. Reggie will walk through specifics in his prepared remarks, but I continue to be confident in our ability to offset inflationary pressure and alleviate supply chain concerns. This means keeping customer bills affordable through our CE way lean operating system.  Top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. The IRP settlement once again demonstrates a constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, delivering important, industry-leading outcomes for all. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, Michigan Attorney General, customer groups, environmental organizations, energy trade representatives and the Consumers Energy work team for the constructive dialogue led to settlement in a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the environment for future generations.  All of this, along with the fundamentals of our simple but impactful investment thesis, leads to a consistent premium total shareholder return for you, our investors. At CMS Energy, we deliver for all our stakeholders. This is why you own us and what you can count on.  Now, let me get on with sharing the great news of the IRP and our quarter. I'm thrilled with this settlement. It provides a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the future -- the environment for the future generations and ensuring financial certainty. You've heard me say before, our IRP is a win for everyone, and let me share with you why.  Our customers will see significant savings in addition to cleaner and more reliable energy. We're accelerating our ESG ambitions to decarbonize and lead the way to protect our planet, exiting coal operations and achieving a 60% carbon emission reduction by 2025, growing our solar bill to 8 gigawatts and accelerating 75 megawatts of battery storage between now and 2027.  Our investors will see capital upside along with the purchase of the Colbert plant and economic incentives and demand-side programs, as well as the continuation of a financial compensation mechanism, FCM, on purchase power agreement, PPAs. We also received regulatory asset treatment at an ROE of 9% on our retired coal asset through the remaining design lives.  This settlement agreement is closely aligned with our original filing, but most notably, we dropped the purchase of CMS Enterprise assets and instead will pursue long-term PPAs of 700 megawatts of Michigan-based capacity starting in 2025. While we believe the purchase of the CMS Enterprise assets was a good value for customers, our primary concern was ensuring we secured sufficient capacity to meet our customers' needs. The proposed RFP, coupled with the purchase of the Colbert plant and a delayed retirement with a Karn 3 and 4 peaking unit will address this concern.  DIG and the peakers and enterprises will have an opportunity to participate in this RFP, but we'll otherwise continue to sell capacity as they've done in the past in the attractive bilateral market. This is a win for everyone.  In March, we announced plans to achieve net 0 carbon emissions for our natural gas system by 2050, which includes both our customers' and our suppliers' emissions. This adds to our long-term plan, both electric and natural gas, to further drive decarbonization and provides meaningful proof points along the clean energy transformation. Net 0 emissions across our natural gas system is certainly an ambitious target, however, we've modeled this extensively. We believe it's achievable. The lowest cost and most reliable transition to a clean energy future is through existing infrastructure in a clean fuel network.  It also acknowledges that there are thoughtful ways to reduce and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across important home heating and thermal electric generation resources. Both are important in ensuring long-term affordability and reliability for our customers.  As we've demonstrated across our electric system with this IRP, these aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. The proof points are in both our net 0 methane target and 20% reduction in gas customer emissions by 2030, and we're delivering on those plans and investment opportunities. This includes accelerating vintage main and service replacement and adding renewable natural gas to our system, all included in our 5-year capital investment plan. It also means greater energy efficiency, carbon offsets and potential hydrogen blending, which provide growth opportunities above our plan, strengthening and lengthening our investment horizon.  Our decarbonization plan is good for our customers, our planet and our investors. This is an important road ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress.  Like I shared at the beginning of my remarks, we've had a great quarter. We're off to a strong start of the year on all fronts. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This is up $0.11 per share from last year ahead of our plan and positions us well as we start the year, giving us confidence as we navigate the 9 months ahead. We are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 per share, and we continue to guide to the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%. The IRP strengthens and lengthen our ability to deliver on our earnings glide path going forward. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a target payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Today, we are reaffirming our $14.3 billion 5-year customer investment plan. As we've noted, the IRP does provide upsides to our current plan, but we'll remain disciplined in our approach. You can expect to see that update as we report fourth quarter results early next year.  As I often say, strong execution leads to strong results, and this quarter was another impressive example. We are confident in the full year guidance, and we are focused on delivering for our customers, the planet and you, our investors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're happy to report our first quarter results for 2022. We delivered adjusted net income of $346 million or $1.20 per share, up 10% of our 2021 first quarter results, largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in this year. From a weather perspective, a relatively high volume of in degree days in the first quarter, coupled with the absence of unfavorable weather during the same period in 2021, provided $0.06 per share of positive variance, as noted on Slide 7.  And from an economic standpoint, we continue to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed pre-pandemic. All in, weather-normalized load in the first quarter contributed $0.04 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021, and is either at or above pre-pandemic levels across each of our customer segments, particularly when excluding the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which reduced customer load by about 2% per year.  Another noteworthy driver of our financial performance for the quarter was rate relief net of investment-related expenses, which contributed $0.03 per share of upside as we continue to realize the renewal effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses and the utility in support of key customer initiatives related to state, reliability and decarbonization is equated to $0.06 per share of negative variance. We also realized $0.02 per share of negative variance for the quarter largely related to annualized financing costs and the timing of tax expenses at the parent company.  Looking ahead, we feel quite good about the remaining 9 months of the year. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a negative impact of about $0.09 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect the impact of weather will be offset by rate relief net of investments, which we estimate to be roughly $0.20 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, and is largely driven by our expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year.  Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expenses at utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the new way and other cost reduction initiatives and a more normalized level of service restoration expense on the fields of record storm activity in 2021. Collectively, we assume O&M cost performance will drive $0.29 per share positive variance.  Lastly, we're assuming normalized operating condition to enterprises given the extended outage mid last year, coupled with the usual conservative assumptions around revenue normalize. As we've said before, we'll continue to plan conservatively like we do every year to ensure we deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, for the benefit of our customers and investors.  Our ability to deliver the results you expect year in and year out is supported by Michigan's strong regulatory environment. And as Garrick highlighted earlier, the multiparty settlement of our IRP provides more evidence of that. As noted, the IRP settlement that we recently filed includes a substantial near-term capital investment opportunity and the acquisition of the Colbert gas plant, which strengthens and lengthens our financial glide path to the tune of about $0.40 to $0.04 per share, with the assumption of reasonable parent funding cost and a 9% ROE on the retired coal assets.  As we look ahead, we remain acutely focused on obtaining approval of our IRP settlement agreement and making progress on our pending rate cases, which are highlighted in the regulatory calendar on Slide 8. As for the latter, just last week, we filed an electric rate case requesting a $272 million revenue increase with a 51.5% equity ratio and a 10.25% ROE. And I'll note that even with this request, the typical electric bill for residential customers will remain below national average.  From a timing perspective, we expect an order of electric rate case in the first quarter of 2023. We also continue to work through our pending gas rate case and recently filed in votes. We anticipate an order for the gas rate case by October of this year.  The question we often get when we discuss our capital investment opportunities and regulatory construct is whether we can manage our cost to minimize the rate impact for our customers. And I'm pleased to report that we remain hard at work on all aspects of our cost to preserve headroom for needed customer investments in the long term and to mitigate the challenging inflationary environment in which we live.  Turning to Slide 9, you'll see that several countermeasures have been implemented over the past several quarters to offset inflationary pressures. On the left hand side of the slide, you'll note that the table highlights across categories that have had well-publicized atypical levels of inflation, specifically cost related to labor, materials and commodities, and the corresponding risk mitigation efforts that we have employed.  Starting with labor. Our workforce is roughly 40% unionized, and in 2020, we renegotiated all 3 of our collective bargaining agreements with 5-year terms, which provides cost and labor stability over the next few years with a substantial portion of our employee base. On the non-union side, we have benefited from a strong retention rate, which is in excess of 95%, and allows us to minimize hiring in a tight labor market.  From a materials perspective, we are actively managing our supply chain to reduce rising input costs. Part of these efforts include leveraging market analysis to optimize terms and conditions with new and existing vendors where possible, while broadening our vendor base. We are also deploying the CE way in our distribution centers to eliminate waste, and we are exploring those best practices with our suppliers to reduce their costs and maintain availability of key materials.  It is also worth noting that approximately 90% of our material costs were capitalized, which reduces the income statement impact in the short term as those costs are incurred over time.  Lastly, given the well-publicized tightening of slower equipment supply, we'll remind you that our solar build-out is modular in nature and allows us to flex the projects over the plan period.  On the commodity side, we continue to run our electric generation fleet in a cost-efficient manner to insulate our customers from market volatility when they are dispatched. In fact, the heat rate of our natural gas plants were some of the lowest in the region, which means we can offer power at a cost lower than market, and that provides substantial value for our customers.  As we manage inflation risk in the current environment, you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide that we still have substantial episodic cost reduction opportunities longer term, which we estimate will generate over $200 million through coal plant retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually with the CE way, which I'll remind you was a key driver in our achievement of over $150 million of cost savings in aggregate over the past few years.  Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success and enabled us to deliver on our financial objectives and they remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business going forward. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to mitigate risk in the current environment, and in the long run, execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and investors, as we always have.  And with that, Austin, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research.\nMichael Sullivan: Garrick, can you maybe just give a little more clarity on what you mean by strengthening the 6% to 8% as it relates to the IRP upside? Is there any reason that we shouldn't think of that as putting you above the 8%?\nGarrick Rochow: Great question, Mike. Let's start here. This is a great settlement, but there's an important regulatory process that we're still in the midst of. And just like back in 2018 and 2019, there's a few parties that can contest the settlement. That's pretty difficult. We anticipate that to occur over the next month in the regulatory proceeding. There's a schedule for that, a calendar for that, that occurs over the month of May. And then the commissioners will issue an order, which we anticipate in late June. It could drift into July, but we anticipate late June at this point.  So I do not want to be out in front of the commissioners on this and put the cart in front of the horse per se, but here's what I'll tell you on this. We feel good about the settlement and the ability because the number of parties are on, and to be able to navigate that process. So what it means from a plan perspective is, as we've shared, that strengthen and lengthen our plan and gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the 6% to 8% towards the high end. As we shared, this is, again, upside to the plan, IRP is upside of the plan.  And here's how I'd think about it. We know and we've certainly made it clear that in 2023, Colbert comes in the plan in the May time frame. That's good from a planning perspective. But remember, this important piece in the 6% to 8%. We deliver each and every year, and then we rebase off of actuals, so that's an important piece. It's that compounding, a quarterly -- compounding it. It's the quality of earnings, which you've come to know and expect. And frankly, that allows us to do the strengthening and lengthening across the broader land.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Sorry. If I could just try a little more. I mean, are you trying to imply that there may just be one outsized growth here, and then that's where you would rebase off of the -- to see 6% to 8% continued off of that? Is that a fair way of reading that?\nGarrick Rochow: No, I don't -- we don't do sugar highs. There's -- We've got nearly 20 years of consistent financial performance, I mean, and we're going to deliver -- our plan here is to deliver year '20. And so again, I think there's strengthening, lengthening of that plan comes from the ability to be at 6% to 8% towards the high end. We've got great confidence in that, but also this rebasing.  Each and every year, you know our history, we deliver and then we rebase off actuals, and that provides a nice opportunity to strengthen the length of the plan.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Got it. And maybe going in a different direction, the electric rate case you just filed. Maybe if you could just walk us through conviction level and getting a bigger portion of the ask this time? Given the order late last year, and maybe some differences this time around or lessons learned?\nGarrick Rochow: I feel really good about this rate case that we're filing. And I'm, again, confident in this regulatory construct. There's been a number of signals here over the last quarter that gives me confidence in the regulatory construct. Let me start there. We had a rehearing on our electric rate case. That was a positive. For a small dollars, but a positive. Our gas rate case, we had SaaS position. The initial valley was constructive and a great starting spot in this IRP settlement with staff, with the Attorney General provides another data point that speaks to the constructive nature of this. We took feedback after the last electric rate case, I shared that in the last earnings call, and we rewrote a lot of our testimony, specifically in the area of electric reliability. Enhance and bolstered our business cases.  And so this is going to be a step change and is a step change in our filing. And I always share we have more work that we're working on to continuously improve that rate case process, but I feel good about our filing. It's primarily made up of electric reliability and resiliency work, important work to deliver for our customers. There's also the Colbert facility is in there. There's a little bit of work on economic development. We've seen a lot of growth here in the state to support that work and this broader clean energy transformation. And so I feel good about the case and the strength of the case and getting a good outcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just want to go with the IRP a little bit more, and you talked about some of the earnings uplift there. And just wondering if you might be able to share, I guess, financing needs that might be possible on the back of that?  And then separately, could you walk us through the RFP that was agreed to as an alternative to the DIG acquisition? And just wondering, there's been a lot of focus on the state and potentially extending Palisades. Do you think this could be an option here?\nGarrick Rochow: Rejji, you will start with the financing piece, and then we can bounce back and forth on your other questions.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Jeremy. I'd say with respect to the financing needs coming out of this IRP settlement agreement, we'll be obviously focused on, assuming we get approval, the acquisition of the Colbert facility. And so that would take place around mid-2023, call it the May time frame. And so we would plan to fund that with debt at the utility. Given our rate making capital structure, you can assume about half of it is funded that way. So call it, roughly $400 million or so based on an $815 million purchase price, and then we fund the balance at the parent. And we still feel quite good about the commitment to avoid issuing equity prior to 2025, and so we would assume that the parent financing would likely include the sort of equity credit like securities that we've done in the past that our hybrids are preferred, which we have really executed at optimal levels over the last several years.  So that would be the financing plan as we sit here today, and we'll keep an eye on how market conditions evolve over that time frame.  Garrick, I'll hand it to you for the RFP and the Palisades.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. From an RFP perspective, what we agreed to in the settlement is 700 -- equivalent of 700 megawatts of a portion of it -- some of our megawatts of load out there, capacity out there. The 500 megawatts is dispatchable, and that's the nature of that and available, reliable generation in the state. And then 200 megawatts is in the category of renewables, again, purchase power agreements.  For those purchase power agreements that are not associated with the affiliate, there's the opportunity to earn a financial compensation mechanism on those. And enterprise has the opportunity to bid in to that 700 megawatts, primarily in the 500 megawatts that are dispatchable in nature. And so that's the nature of the RFP.  In terms of Palisades, it's important to remember, we're not the owner or operator of Palisades. We've not been involved in any conversations with the Department of Energy. And if for specific questions in this call on Palisades, I'd really direct them to Entergy specific to the plant.  Now our governor has came back -- has came out in support of keeping Palisades operational. We're certainly supportive of our governor and the administration and in even a broader context, we believe in nuclear energy as part of the solution here for reliable, dispatchable and clean energy across our nation in Michigan. Our PPA on that facility expires here at the end of May. It is an expensive purchase power agreement, and as we've shared in the course of this call, we're laser-focused on reducing costs for our customers, and so that is front and center for us.  We'd certainly entertain a long-term purchase power agreement, a new purchase power agreement with the facility entertaining discussions and conversation about that, but it does have to be at a competitive price. That will be an important factor. And then also, we expect to receive on of -- a stand on that new PPA as well.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And maybe pivoting a bit here towards decarbonization, what investment opportunities are you seeing in support of decarbonization for the gas system? And maybe thinking about RNG a bit more, how much regulated CapEx do you think this could translate into?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, in our 5-year plan, there's a hefty amount. There's about $5 billion, a little more. It's aimed at decarbonization of our natural gas system. Again, it's multiple benefits. You're out there replacing old pipe, vintage pipe as we call it in services. It makes the system safer, improves reliability of natural gas system, also eliminates methane emissions, one of the leading causes of climate change. And so we've got a target of net 0 by 2030, so those investments are being made right now over the course of the 5 years and will extend into the 10-year plan as well.  We see our renewable natural gas is also part of that solution. It is part of this gas rate case that's underway right now. If you get into the details of staff's position, they were not supportive of that renewable natural gas. However, they left an opening in there, which we think we can mitigate in the course of rebuttal, and move that into the utility. There's some work to be done there in our gas case.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful. I'll leave it there. .\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Weisel from Scotia Bank.\nAndrew Weisel: First question, I want to ask a little bit more about the inflationary pressures. I appreciate all the details you gave. In the past, I think you talked about limiting bill increases to say 2% or 3%, if I remember correctly. My question, how confident are you about your ability to stick to that in, say, 2022 and maybe '23? I assume widespread inflation won't be as big of a concern after that. But in the near term, do you still feel comfortable with those past targets?\nGarrick Rochow: Everyone in this sector and even outside the sector, it's been inflation. To me, the bigger question is who do you think is best at managing that? And I would put us up to the top of the list. Our ability to leverage CE way and provide cost savings for our customers is certainly -- again, we talked about it as flexing our muscle here.  We got great examples of that in 2020. We saw sales drop. We find $100 million of savings in the organization. We've got in 2021, in August, we had $0.16 of impact just to storms. We offset that. We have an amazing ability to be able to leverage the tools of the CE way and then plus automation, I would add, to be able to mitigate costs. And so Rejji went through a number of examples in the way we manage that across the system.  And so long term, when we look at our 5-year plan. And even in the short term, there's a nice ability to manage rates and keep them affordable for our customers. In line with kind of traditional inflation, you might say, but I feel confident in our plan to be able to mitigate much of the impact of inflation going forward.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. Next question is at Enterprise, it's mentioned that Big and the Peakers will likely bid into the upcoming RFP. I don't expect anything too specific for obvious competitive reasons, but can you qualitatively talk about how you think of the trade-off between, say, price certainty and stability that would come with a long-term contract versus the potential for lower revenues given the competitive nature of bidding?\nGarrick Rochow: I think, Rejji, I'll tag team this one. Bottom line is it's something that Enterprise is going to consider. Again, I'm not certain we'll participate in that. We have potential to participate in that RFP, and we'll make that evaluation. The capacity market is certainly, as we've seen across MISO, an opportunity as well and -- for upside with our enterprise assets. And so if there's an evaluation, we'll participate in it and take a look at the impact of how Big participates either in the bilateral market or our bid into this longer-term PPA with the utility.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Andrew. The only thing I would add to that is, philosophically, we've always had the mindset that we try to run our non-utility businesses like a utility and as low a beta fashion as possible. And so if we have an opportunity to get attractive levels for energy and capacity, and we can do that over the long term, that's generally been our bias, and we've done that on the energy and capacity side at DIG for some time now. And when we own the bank, that's how we ran the bank as well. It's just trying to lock in as much revenue as possible and run it on a lower basis.  And so we'll see. I think it's a function of where the market is at the time and how long the PPAs are in the bilateral market versus what might be offered in this RFP. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like and we'll run the business accordingly.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. That makes sense. And just lastly, what's the timing of the RFP? And when you'll communicate AFD is, in fact, participating or not, Big and the Peakers?\nGarrick Rochow: I would anticipate, at least initially here, is that our RFP would be issued within the fiscal year 2022.\nOperator: Our next question is from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: First question. Garrick. On the solar, you've talked about just modular in nature then kind of shift the timing and whatnot. But just holistically, I guess, whether it's the megawatts that's kind of a building transfer or the PPAs that are expected to come online, I guess, over the next couple of years that will earn the financial compensation mechanism. Just your broad level of confidence, I guess, in terms of being able to mitigate any impact from what's going on in the solar space?\nGarrick Rochow: I'll start with the punch line or the bottom line. No material impact to the 5-year plan, continued confidence in our 2022 guidance and then continued confidence in the longer-term plan, the 5 years and the 6% to 8% and meeting toward the high end. So that's the bottom line. Let me tell you why.  This IRP is 8 gigawatts. It's not 8 gigawatts tomorrow or even in the 5-year plan. We have 15 to 20 years to build this out. So there's considerable on flexibility to be able to construct that. And just like everyone else in the industry, the Department of Commerce and this investigation slowed things up in some of our projects. But these are megawatts that are going to get built. These are renewable projects that are going to get built because they're part of our broader IRP in nature. But again, let me try to offer some context from a size perspective.  We're building out own generation here, about 150 megawatts per year. So we're talking about 2 projects. In 2024, we go up to 250 megawatts per year. And so this annual capital spend is around $200 million to $250 million. This is manageable, easily manageable. And in fact, this is -- I've been in operations for 20 years. This is work that happens every year. There's stuff that goes in and out of the plan based on a lot of different variables, and so easily manageable from a capital perspective.  In fact, and just as a reminder, we have $3 billion to $4 billion of capital backlog in things like electric reliability, investments in our gas system. 80% of those projects are less than $200 million, so there's ability to put them into the plan and offer real value for our customers.  The other important part of this clean energy journey, as well as a reminder here, that although solar has been impacted, we're still progressing with wind in the state of Michigan and we're investing a lot in the space of our hydro facilities. We have 15 hydro facilities here. There's smart and thoughtful investments occurring there as well. And those are on progress, on target. And so I feel good about that from where we're headed from a clean energy perspective.  And the last piece that I'll also point to, and I think this is important from a capacity perspective. And I noted in my prepared remarks that Karn 3 and 4 continues to operate to 2031. Karn 3 and 4, we originally proposed retiring in 2023. So this settlement offers some additional flexibility from a capacity build perspective. And so again, we've got some flexibility to weather things and be able to meet all our customers' needs.  So again, we feel good about the capital plan, confident in our earnings guidance both in the year and in the long term.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. My second question on those enterprise assets that -- in the non-regulated ones like Big, given we won't be going to rate base here with the settlement. Depending on what you decide on the RFP if whether you'll purchase it or not, how do you just think about strategically these assets now going forward as part of the portfolio?\nGarrick Rochow: The enterprise assets are an important part of our portfolio. It's small but important, it makes about 4% of our earnings mix. And again, this goes back a little bit. We used to talk about the Ferrari in the garage and then it was a Tesla in the garage. It's probably the new electric Corvette in the garage. I don't know how you want to say it. But with capacity prices, there's some certainties of upside here in some of our -- in some of our Big and some of the Peakers.  But by and large, this business is about renewables and customer-focused renewables. And it's small in nature, and we deliver strategic solutions for our customers. Hasn't changed, but it continues to be a consistent performer for our business.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. It's been a while since we've heard that reference, but good to hear it again.\nGarrick Rochow: I want to bring that back. It's -- it's a great asset for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners.\nShahriar Pourreza: Great. So just one follow-up on Palisades, Garrick. Just can you remind us how many megawatts could be potentially re-PPA under the assumption the plant can remain viable here? And obviously, the government highlighted that there is a potential owner that's interested in acquiring the asset. Are you having sort of any discussions right now in recontracting, assuming can you keep the assets viable? Which timing seems a little bit tight, but just curious on if there's any dialogue?\nGarrick Rochow: It's roughly 800 megawatts, a little shy of 800 megawatts. I think it's around 780 megawatts for Palisades. In line with the Governor's letter, we're certainly open to conversations and discussions. We've had some conversations more just to understand the complexities of the situation to understand what's going on. But nothing that's really got to any level of seriousness on a long-term purchase power agreement.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay, got it. And then just real quick, Rejji, you're sort of thinking about financing needs. Can you just remind us on the preferred options? And do you see a potential to lean more on credit metrics, just given nearly a fully regulated business mix and potentially accretive CapEx updates in the near term?\nRejji Hayes: Shar. So we have been targeting that sort of mid-teens FFO to debt for the rating agencies for some time now. And certainly, the sale of EnerBank gave us a nice uplift, at least in the case of S&P. And so while we do have some cushion to maybe be a little more aggressive on the funding strategy, we worked very hard to get to the level that we're at today. We've worked very hard to get the ratings we have today, and so our intent is not to stress those metrics.  And so we like the fact that we've got a little cushion on those metrics. And if that allows us to continue not to issue equity through 2025, we'll look to do that. And if we can extend beyond 2025, we'll look to do that, but not to the detriment of our metrics or rating.  So we still like that mid-teens area. That's where we are. We have a little cushion there, and we'll continue to plan the business that way.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Arnold of Vertical Research.\nJonathan Arnold: A quick one on -- just Palisades, where it to be extended? I guess, whether or not that was with the PPA, how would you think about that in the context of your overall IRP plan and just case as you need?\nGarrick Rochow: Two pieces there that's really, really important. And it does have to be a competitive purchase power agreement, so I'll reemphasize that component of it as well. And if we were to consider that and have those -- and have those conversations, again, we would expect financial compensation mechanism on those as well.  Again, it just provides additional flexibility for us in clean energy. And so we'll be a little bit long from a capacity perspective, but there's opportunities to think about different investments and give us a little more flexibility in our -- even further flexibility in our solar build-out.\nJonathan Arnold: Okay. And then just -- I had to go back a bit. I think it was early last year that you last gave a slide on [indiscernible] showing potential pre-tax earnings, step-up opportunities. So my question really is, is that prior disclosure still a bad one that we can think about? Or should we be looking for you to tell us something else at some point in the future? Or is that still a decent guide?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So Jonathan, we still feel good about the revenue opportunities at DIG, particularly now that we don't foresee it being part of the IRP. And so I'm going to go from memory, but we were somewhere around $35 million of revenue or pre-tax earnings associated with DIG and we still think that that's a pretty good base case to run. And what we're also seeing, probably unsurprisingly, is a tightening of the bilateral capacity market, which I think Garrick had accurately noted as attractive in his prepared remarks because we do continue to see it tighten and we do expect to see even more attractive capacity and energy opportunities on the contracted side at DIG.  So I'd say base case, it's good to be around that $35 million area, but there's certainly upside opportunities in the coming years if we continue to participate in that bilateral market.\nJonathan Arnold: I guess I was asking more about the $90 million that you had that $35 million stepping up from. I wasn't sure if you want to --\nGarrick Rochow: So, yes. So that's -- Yes. So that working assumption was if the bilateral market went to CONE, which was at the time around $7.50 per kilowatt month. And so in the event the bilateral market continues to tighten and gets to those levels, that certainly could be within the realm of possibility to see upside at that level, but we're certainly not planning for that given our nature. But yes, it could be an opportunity over time if we continue to see Zone 7 tighten.\nJonathan Arnold: Great. And I -- yes, I think that's it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar.\nTravis Miller: Wondering as you did your long-term reliability modeling as part of that IRP, when did reliability get to be an issue? Is that 60-plus percent range in 2040 with renewables, is that about where you start to max out on renewable ability to put into the mix?\nGarrick Rochow: I wouldn't put it that way. Here's the process of an integrated resource plan. We do loss of load expectations study. There's a number of other variables. We look at it from a system reliability perspective. And so it's an important mix of renewables and batteries, particularly in part of the plan, but also dispatchable generation. So you're getting things like gas, at least in our case, natural gas and part of the plan. And so all those come together.  And this plan that we submitted was more reliable than our previous IRP in terms of the -- in terms of the build-out. And then our extension of Karn 3 and 4, again, it was planned to be retired in 2023 and extending that to 2031, continues to provide additional reliability over the course of this decade.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Got it. And then kind of similar on that, could we expect some of that upside in the distribution and transmission bucket as opposed to maybe more on the generation side? The upside CapEx that you were talking about?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, broader, we have -- again, I look at the our 10-year, 15, 20 years, there's ample capital upside. And we have about $3 billion to $4 billion of capital that's not in the plan that are specific projects identified that improve our gas system, more replacement of mains that looks at reliability and resiliency. We've got a large $5.5 billion focus on that. I mean, much of that is in this electric rate case to improve reliability for our customers. Those are the things that fit into that plan and continue to have that long horizon of capital investment opportunities.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then one just real quick. With the IRP change, your general kind of every year type of cadence on the regulatory filings, either electric or gas?\nGarrick Rochow: The IRP won't have any impact on our rate case proceedings. So we'll continue to stay -- the main plan is just to go with annual rate cases. But on occasion, we do stay out for a year, and we have. Our gas case is a great example that we've been out for 2 years and are in for a case right now.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Great.\nOperator: Our next question is from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just one for me. Maybe can you just, at a high level, elaborate how the financial compensation mechanisms work? And then as we're thinking about our models, how should we be modeling upside in terms of timing? Is there sort of gradual pickup in earnings as you sort of go through the RFPs? Or how does that work? Any color is appreciated.\nRejji Hayes: Durgesh, this is Rejji. So the financial compensated -- financial compensation mechanism, it applied to PPAs. And we can have the team go through the math with you off-line, but in essence, you're applying what is the equivalent of our after-tax WACC as it stood in the 2018 IRP at just over 5.6%. And you're going to apply that to the megawatts of PPAs you're taking on as part of the IRP. And then the first IRP in 2018 was 550 megawatts or thereabouts, and so you would apply it to that. You also obviously take into account the hours per year, the energy cost as well as just capacity factor of the resource. And so you put all that through the vegematic. And for that first tranche of the IRP, we assume that was about $4 million of pre-tax earnings.  And so per that math, you would apply that to what we will PPA in this next IRP. And so we've said it's a 700 megawatt RFP that will roll out, assuming we get approval in the latter portion of this year, as Garrick noted. And there'll be 2 tranches, 500 megawatts dispatchable, 200 megawatts of other, and we'll have an FCM-applied to those PPAs once those are resolved. Is that helpful?\nDurgesh Chopra: Very helpful. And then in terms of timing, you mentioned later this year. So these are basically -- these are earnings uplifts next year. Is that the right way to think about it?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Let me be clear, the RFP for that 700-megawatt tranche of PPA, and again, it's going to be 2 tranches, 1500 megawatts of dispatchable local and 200 megawatts of other. The RFP would commence this year, but we would not effectuate the PPAs until the 2025 time frame. And so you wouldn't see any of the earnings associated with those financial compensation mechanism until that time frame.  I also want to be very clear that in the event Enterprises participates in that 500-megawatt tranche, then they would not be eligible for the FCM or we would not be eligible for the FCM.\nDurgesh Chopra: That is very helpful. I'll follow up with the IR team with some more details, but this is extremely helpful.\nOperator: Next question is from Gregg Orrill of UBS.\nGregg Orrill: Yes. Maybe a clarification. This might bring up an old discussion, but what is the design life on Campbell units where you earn -- you would earn the 9% ROE under the IRP settlement?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Gregg. So of the 3 units, 2 of the units, design life runs until 2031. That's for Campbell 1 and 2. And then for Campbell 3, it's through 2039, and so that's where we'd earn that 9% on the regulatory asset after the retirement date.\nOperator: Next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So just coming back to the earlier conversation on the $0.03 to $0.04 of upside here from the IRP, can we go back to that math and just rehash it to start from the gross number and net that down? And specifically, what I was trying to reconcile is how do we think about the acquisition here, sort of the gross $800 million, and then reconcile that down to $0.03 to $0.04 ultimately? It seems just a little conservative, shall we say, relative to what I would otherwise expect. And maybe we could be a little bit more explicit, again, understanding some of the nuances on financing to try to reconcile that?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Julien, this is Rejji. For the $0.03 to $0.04, we're assuming it's an $815 million purchase price is codified in the settlement agreement. And so given our rate construct, you can assume, again, with our ratemaking capital structure, you're going to get 40% of that as equity. And you have to net of, obviously, parent funding costs, and we've made the usual conservative assumptions around that. And so that's where you get a good portion of the accretion I noted.  But then you also have to net out, I'd say, the downward revision in the ROE on the regulatory assets. And so remember, the IRP was not incorporated into our 5-year plan. And so we were assuming we're going to earn 9.9% on those coal facilities through their design life. And so when the settlement agreement is structured, that's going to step down to 9%. So you get a little bit of dilution there plus dilution from the parent financing, and so that's what gets you to sort of $0.03 to $0.04.  It's also worth noting, again, clearly, we are not presupposing any outcome on the PPA, that 700-megawatt tranche, so that's not included in the math. And so we're applying the usual conservatism, but that's where the math takes us, about $0.03 to $0.04. In 2023, if all comes to fruition, obviously, you have a partial year. So you wouldn't get -- you'd only get about 6, 7 months of that if we close the transaction in May as anticipated, and then you get annualized about $0.03 to $0.04.  Is that helpful?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Absolutely. I appreciate it. I very much appreciate that. I -- actually, since you bring it up here, just to keep going along that logical thought process. How do you think about that 700 gigawatt PPA? I mean, in terms of ownership opportunities, you seem to be, in part, downplaying the big element of this in terms of committing to bid that -- into that procurement process. I mean, what other avenues or shots on goal, if you want to call it, do you have for an ownership opportunity there as you think about the array of different approaches you could take?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, yes, to be very clear, it's certainly an opportunity for DIG, particularly or specifically for that 500-megawatt tranche, which is essentially going to be earmarked for local stackable -- a local dispatchable resource. And so certainly, DIG would qualify for that, and so that is certainly an opportunity.  And as we think about the alternatives as fiduciaries, they could certainly participate in that or DIG could participate in that. And a 10-year PPA, if DIG prevails, that's not an -- that's a pretty attractive alternative depending on where the economics end up. But as I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing a very attractive bilateral market shaping up here in Zone 7, just with continued tightening. And so we are seeing levels that are in excess from our existing capacity contracts and energy contracts, and so we'll weigh the alternatives once the RFP comes around and see what we'll do there.  On the 200 megawatts, obviously, DIG wouldn't be eligible for that. But we'll see what else comes around, and we'll get an FCM on that. And so we're not presupposing any of those economics in the EPS I noted in my prepared remarks, but it certainly creates an opportunity for DIG without a doubt.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, indeed. All right. Best of luck.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicholas Campanella of Credit Suisse.\nNicholas Campanella: Congrats on the IRP. I just wanted to -- sorry to belabor the point on the renewable supply chain stuff. But I just -- just the bottom line takeaway is that you have, I think, roughly $700 million of clean, call it, clean generation spend in '22 and then $600 million in '23. That's all unchanged. Is that correct?\nGarrick Rochow: I think the important part of that clean energy spend in those 2 years you referenced is it's not all solar. There's a good portion of hydro and wind in there, and so again, we're talking about into $200 million, $250 million that would be on an annual basis that would be in the solar area. So it's -- that's the difference. Is that helpful?\nNicholas Campanella: Great. Yes, that's very helpful. And then just -- I know in the fourth quarter, we talked a lot about Colbert, so I figured we can talk about some other upside opportunities. In the fourth quarter, we talked about the VGP potential gas and electric capital upside. I know they weren't in the deck today, but maybe can you just kind of talk about where you are in potentially bringing those opportunities into the 5-year plan? Is that more of an EEI fourth quarter item? And I know we're focused on the IRP in the near term, but just what about all the other upside opportunities that are outside the plan today?\nGarrick Rochow: That's great. Again, we'll take a look at this 5-year plan. We're building it out right now, and we'll share it here in Q4. Obviously, Colbert is a big piece of it. Those other areas within the IRP as well. We accelerated 75 megawatts of battery storage into the years of 2024 and 2027, so that has to be incorporated in as new capital upside in that 5-year plan. Extension of Karn 3 and 4 has some impact as well. So those are all additions and things that need to be worked through from a capital plan.  In terms of the voluntary green pricing, that also continues to progress nicely with our customers as they subscribe. We build out that plan. We've issued an RFP for that work. I haven't seen the results of that yet. It's still out there, but that would be a -- potentially solar could be other renewables build in the 2024 to 2027 time line. So that's -- upside is, again, we plan conservatively, is materializing, so we're not ready to announce that yet. But directionally, it looks good. Is that helpful?\nNicholas Campanella: Yes. Congrats again on the IRP.\nOperator: Next question is from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.\nPaul Patterson: Congratulations on the IRP settlement. And most of the questions have been answered here, but just with respect to sales and what have you. Is COVID over, do you think? I mean, are we now sort of the normal level of what you think will be normal going forward? Or -- I don't know. Just hoping maybe it is.\nGarrick Rochow: We're all hoping it is over, too. Rejji, walk through sales piece a little bit, and then I'll talk more on some macro factors. So maybe just touch on sales, Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So Paul, to be clear, I won't give you a medical assessment because clearly, the pandemic is still with us. I know that's not the spirit of the question, but I figured I'd be remiss if I didn't say that.  But from, I'd say, a retail sales perspective, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing virtually across all the customer classes, as I noted in my prepared remarks. And so whether it's commercial, we're up 3% above pre-pandemic levels. So looking at sort of Q1 2022 versus Q1 2019, residential is up versus the 2019 pre-pandemic level, so we're still seeing that nice mix that we've enjoyed for the last couple of years. And so Residential is starting to come back to a good deal, but still hanging in there and again, in excess of the pre-pandemic levels.  And then on a total retail sales basis, we are now about 1% above the pre-pandemic levels, and industrial is about flat, excluding one large low-margin customer.  So I would say, again, per my prepared remarks, I think at this point, we are effectively at or better than pre-pandemic levels across most of our customer classes. And so we feel good about the economic conditions in Michigan, and we continue to see very attractive leading indicators. And I think it's also worth noting that of the percentages I just shared with you, that does not take into account the energy waste reduction programs we have that reduced our load year-over-year by 1.5% to 2%. So when you exclude that, that performance looks even better.  So we feel very good on the retail sales side, but again, obviously, the pandemic still with us. But Garrick, if you have any other comments.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, so just some quick macro factors. So Bloomberg recognized Michigan is the number one economy -- the state economy coming out post-pandemic, and so that's certainly a highlight. They've been recognized as the top state for foreign direct investment, over 14 -- really approaching 15,000 different firms that are located here in Michigan, 5,000 different locations. The big announcement with General Motors, but it's not just General Motors, there's a host of other things from manufacturing to agriculture and then agricultural processing that have grown here in the state.  So I feel good by the broader economic trends that we're seeing here in Michigan as well. Paul.\nPaul Patterson: Okay. Great. And just -- the other final thing is that there was some legislation that was -- recently introduced regarding outages and reliability. It seems to me that maybe it was more of a Detroit thing that might be driving -- I wasn't really completely clear. I was just wondering, do you have any color about -- you don't see this very often about what might be driving that legislative? I mean, it seems like it's some Democrat representatives or whatever that are proposing it. And I'm just wondering if you had any thoughts about that?\nGarrick Rochow: Our electric rate case and our plan underway certainly looks at improving electric liability across the state to improve value for our customers. And so that's well underway. This legislation that was introduced, we don't anticipate getting any traction without a committee. That's the short of it.\nOperator: Our final question is from Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Garrick, Rejji. Hopefully, an easy one. Where is Rocco? It's the first call I've been on without Rocco. Just hopefully, two easy ones. I guess following up on Mike's earlier question. I think the question is going around maybe moving above the 6% to 8% EPS growth rate. I think, Garrick, you responded with CMS doesn't do sugar highs, I guess. If I think about it, is there any desire of the company maybe to get back to that previous earnings trajectory that you had before the EnerBank sale?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, let me say. The first question is Rocco's great. Austin is really performing well during those calls as well. Shout out to Austin. But bottom line, from the earnings guide path we had with EnerBank, we see a clear path to do so. And I would suggest that we're on that path for all the reasons I stated earlier in regards to my response to Mike. And so I feel good about where we're heading, and confident here in that growth rate in the future.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then last question, then I'll let you guys get back to doing some work there. I guess since the IRP filing, it appears we've moved from an energy transition theme to maybe energy security theme. Have the state regulators given any messaging on energy security that would benefit your CapEx plan?\nGarrick Rochow: I would argue that we're focused on both. Again, we can't sacrifice one for the other, and so this IRP that's settled here does both. It allows us for that clean energy transformation as well as ensuring reliability and security of the state.  And so again, there's always some policymakers and legislators that are looking at that, and we're going to continue to look at opportunities from a capital investment perspective. But again, we feel really good about our 5-year plan to balance both reliability security of the grid as well as planet. And I would add to it, our customers and ensuring that it's affordable. And Rejji, why don't you add something as well?\nRejji Hayes: Anthony, the only thing I would add just to get into some of the specifics of the IRP from a capacity perspective, and to Garrick comment, this is why we feel quite good about energy security and reliability, however you want to refer to it, is that the Colbert facility is going to bring over 1.1 gigawatts of capacity. Again, assuming the settlement agreement is approved. We're also going to RFP shortly after approval. If all goes according to plan, the 700-megawatt tranche of PPA opportunity by 2025, and so that offers additional capacity. And again, 500 megawatts of that will be local dispatchable capacity.  We're also extending the retirement or delaying the retirement of Karn 3 and 4, which also provides over a gigawatt of capacity. And so again, we're taking, obviously, affordability into account. We're taking reliability into account and we're taking, obviously, the clean aspects of our plan into account, and that's what we feel good about. Not just the economics for all stakeholders, but most importantly, reliability.\nAnthony Crowdell: Looking forward to seeing you guys in Miami.\nGarrick Rochow: Same\nOperator: That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Well, thank you, Austin. Nice job for our first time with Austin. And I'd like to thank all our callers and investors for joining us today. Take care and stay safe.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we're happy to report our first quarter results for 2022. We delivered adjusted net income of $346 million or $1.20 per share, up 10% of our 2021 first quarter results, largely driven by favorable weather and economic conditions in this year. From a weather perspective, a relatively high volume of in degree days in the first quarter, coupled with the absence of unfavorable weather during the same period in 2021, provided $0.06 per share of positive variance, as noted on Slide 7.  And from an economic standpoint, we continue to see strong commercial and industrial load in our electric business, while weather-normalized residential load continues to exceed pre-pandemic. All in, weather-normalized load in the first quarter contributed $0.04 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2021, and is either at or above pre-pandemic levels across each of our customer segments, particularly when excluding the effects of our energy efficiency programs, which reduced customer load by about 2% per year.  Another noteworthy driver of our financial performance for the quarter was rate relief net of investment-related expenses, which contributed $0.03 per share of upside as we continue to realize the renewal effects of tax benefits from our 2020 gas rate settlement. These sources of positive variance were partially offset by increased operating and maintenance or O&M expenses and the utility in support of key customer initiatives related to state, reliability and decarbonization is equated to $0.06 per share of negative variance. We also realized $0.02 per share of negative variance for the quarter largely related to annualized financing costs and the timing of tax expenses at the parent company.  Looking ahead, we feel quite good about the remaining 9 months of the year. As always, we plan for normal weather, which we estimate will have a negative impact of about $0.09 per share versus the comparable period in 2021. We expect the impact of weather will be offset by rate relief net of investments, which we estimate to be roughly $0.20 per share versus the comparable period in 2021, and is largely driven by our expectation of a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case later this year.  Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expenses at utility, driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the new way and other cost reduction initiatives and a more normalized level of service restoration expense on the fields of record storm activity in 2021. Collectively, we assume O&M cost performance will drive $0.29 per share positive variance.  Lastly, we're assuming normalized operating condition to enterprises given the extended outage mid last year, coupled with the usual conservative assumptions around revenue normalize. As we've said before, we'll continue to plan conservatively like we do every year to ensure we deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, for the benefit of our customers and investors.  Our ability to deliver the results you expect year in and year out is supported by Michigan's strong regulatory environment. And as Garrick highlighted earlier, the multiparty settlement of our IRP provides more evidence of that. As noted, the IRP settlement that we recently filed includes a substantial near-term capital investment opportunity and the acquisition of the Colbert gas plant, which strengthens and lengthens our financial glide path to the tune of about $0.40 to $0.04 per share, with the assumption of reasonable parent funding cost and a 9% ROE on the retired coal assets.  As we look ahead, we remain acutely focused on obtaining approval of our IRP settlement agreement and making progress on our pending rate cases, which are highlighted in the regulatory calendar on Slide 8. As for the latter, just last week, we filed an electric rate case requesting a $272 million revenue increase with a 51.5% equity ratio and a 10.25% ROE. And I'll note that even with this request, the typical electric bill for residential customers will remain below national average.  From a timing perspective, we expect an order of electric rate case in the first quarter of 2023. We also continue to work through our pending gas rate case and recently filed in votes. We anticipate an order for the gas rate case by October of this year.  The question we often get when we discuss our capital investment opportunities and regulatory construct is whether we can manage our cost to minimize the rate impact for our customers. And I'm pleased to report that we remain hard at work on all aspects of our cost to preserve headroom for needed customer investments in the long term and to mitigate the challenging inflationary environment in which we live.  Turning to Slide 9, you'll see that several countermeasures have been implemented over the past several quarters to offset inflationary pressures. On the left hand side of the slide, you'll note that the table highlights across categories that have had well-publicized atypical levels of inflation, specifically cost related to labor, materials and commodities, and the corresponding risk mitigation efforts that we have employed.  Starting with labor. Our workforce is roughly 40% unionized, and in 2020, we renegotiated all 3 of our collective bargaining agreements with 5-year terms, which provides cost and labor stability over the next few years with a substantial portion of our employee base. On the non-union side, we have benefited from a strong retention rate, which is in excess of 95%, and allows us to minimize hiring in a tight labor market.  From a materials perspective, we are actively managing our supply chain to reduce rising input costs. Part of these efforts include leveraging market analysis to optimize terms and conditions with new and existing vendors where possible, while broadening our vendor base. We are also deploying the CE way in our distribution centers to eliminate waste, and we are exploring those best practices with our suppliers to reduce their costs and maintain availability of key materials.  It is also worth noting that approximately 90% of our material costs were capitalized, which reduces the income statement impact in the short term as those costs are incurred over time.  Lastly, given the well-publicized tightening of slower equipment supply, we'll remind you that our solar build-out is modular in nature and allows us to flex the projects over the plan period.  On the commodity side, we continue to run our electric generation fleet in a cost-efficient manner to insulate our customers from market volatility when they are dispatched. In fact, the heat rate of our natural gas plants were some of the lowest in the region, which means we can offer power at a cost lower than market, and that provides substantial value for our customers.  As we manage inflation risk in the current environment, you'll note on the right-hand side of the slide that we still have substantial episodic cost reduction opportunities longer term, which we estimate will generate over $200 million through coal plant retirements and the expiration of high-priced power purchase agreements. These cost savings are above and beyond what we'll aim to achieve annually with the CE way, which I'll remind you was a key driver in our achievement of over $150 million of cost savings in aggregate over the past few years.  Sustainable and agile cost management has been one of the key pillars of our success and enabled us to deliver on our financial objectives and they remain ample opportunities to reduce costs across the business going forward. Given our track record of reducing costs, we're highly confident that we'll be able to mitigate risk in the current environment, and in the long run, execute our capital plan, delivering substantial value for customers and investors, as we always have.  And with that, Austin, please open the lines for Q&A. Yes, Jeremy. I'd say with respect to the financing needs coming out of this IRP settlement agreement, we'll be obviously focused on, assuming we get approval, the acquisition of the Colbert facility. And so that would take place around mid-2023, call it the May time frame. And so we would plan to fund that with debt at the utility. Given our rate making capital structure, you can assume about half of it is funded that way. So call it, roughly $400 million or so based on an $815 million purchase price, and then we fund the balance at the parent. And we still feel quite good about the commitment to avoid issuing equity prior to 2025, and so we would assume that the parent financing would likely include the sort of equity credit like securities that we've done in the past that our hybrids are preferred, which we have really executed at optimal levels over the last several years.  So that would be the financing plan as we sit here today, and we'll keep an eye on how market conditions evolve over that time frame.  Garrick, I'll hand it to you for the RFP and the Palisades. Yes, Andrew. The only thing I would add to that is, philosophically, we've always had the mindset that we try to run our non-utility businesses like a utility and as low a beta fashion as possible. And so if we have an opportunity to get attractive levels for energy and capacity, and we can do that over the long term, that's generally been our bias, and we've done that on the energy and capacity side at DIG for some time now. And when we own the bank, that's how we ran the bank as well. It's just trying to lock in as much revenue as possible and run it on a lower basis.  And so we'll see. I think it's a function of where the market is at the time and how long the PPAs are in the bilateral market versus what might be offered in this RFP. So we'll see what the fact pattern looks like and we'll run the business accordingly. Shar. So we have been targeting that sort of mid-teens FFO to debt for the rating agencies for some time now. And certainly, the sale of EnerBank gave us a nice uplift, at least in the case of S&P. And so while we do have some cushion to maybe be a little more aggressive on the funding strategy, we worked very hard to get to the level that we're at today. We've worked very hard to get the ratings we have today, and so our intent is not to stress those metrics.  And so we like the fact that we've got a little cushion on those metrics. And if that allows us to continue not to issue equity through 2025, we'll look to do that. And if we can extend beyond 2025, we'll look to do that, but not to the detriment of our metrics or rating.  So we still like that mid-teens area. That's where we are. We have a little cushion there, and we'll continue to plan the business that way. Durgesh, this is Rejji. So the financial compensated -- financial compensation mechanism, it applied to PPAs. And we can have the team go through the math with you off-line, but in essence, you're applying what is the equivalent of our after-tax WACC as it stood in the 2018 IRP at just over 5.6%. And you're going to apply that to the megawatts of PPAs you're taking on as part of the IRP. And then the first IRP in 2018 was 550 megawatts or thereabouts, and so you would apply it to that. You also obviously take into account the hours per year, the energy cost as well as just capacity factor of the resource. And so you put all that through the vegematic. And for that first tranche of the IRP, we assume that was about $4 million of pre-tax earnings.  And so per that math, you would apply that to what we will PPA in this next IRP. And so we've said it's a 700 megawatt RFP that will roll out, assuming we get approval in the latter portion of this year, as Garrick noted. And there'll be 2 tranches, 500 megawatts dispatchable, 200 megawatts of other, and we'll have an FCM-applied to those PPAs once those are resolved. Is that helpful? Yes, Gregg. So of the 3 units, 2 of the units, design life runs until 2031. That's for Campbell 1 and 2. And then for Campbell 3, it's through 2039, and so that's where we'd earn that 9% on the regulatory asset after the retirement date. Yes, Julien, this is Rejji. For the $0.03 to $0.04, we're assuming it's an $815 million purchase price is codified in the settlement agreement. And so given our rate construct, you can assume, again, with our ratemaking capital structure, you're going to get 40% of that as equity. And you have to net of, obviously, parent funding costs, and we've made the usual conservative assumptions around that. And so that's where you get a good portion of the accretion I noted.  But then you also have to net out, I'd say, the downward revision in the ROE on the regulatory assets. And so remember, the IRP was not incorporated into our 5-year plan. And so we were assuming we're going to earn 9.9% on those coal facilities through their design life. And so when the settlement agreement is structured, that's going to step down to 9%. So you get a little bit of dilution there plus dilution from the parent financing, and so that's what gets you to sort of $0.03 to $0.04.  It's also worth noting, again, clearly, we are not presupposing any outcome on the PPA, that 700-megawatt tranche, so that's not included in the math. And so we're applying the usual conservatism, but that's where the math takes us, about $0.03 to $0.04. In 2023, if all comes to fruition, obviously, you have a partial year. So you wouldn't get -- you'd only get about 6, 7 months of that if we close the transaction in May as anticipated, and then you get annualized about $0.03 to $0.04.  Is that helpful? Yes. So Paul, to be clear, I won't give you a medical assessment because clearly, the pandemic is still with us. I know that's not the spirit of the question, but I figured I'd be remiss if I didn't say that.  But from, I'd say, a retail sales perspective, we continue to be encouraged with what we're seeing virtually across all the customer classes, as I noted in my prepared remarks. And so whether it's commercial, we're up 3% above pre-pandemic levels. So looking at sort of Q1 2022 versus Q1 2019, residential is up versus the 2019 pre-pandemic level, so we're still seeing that nice mix that we've enjoyed for the last couple of years. And so Residential is starting to come back to a good deal, but still hanging in there and again, in excess of the pre-pandemic levels.  And then on a total retail sales basis, we are now about 1% above the pre-pandemic levels, and industrial is about flat, excluding one large low-margin customer.  So I would say, again, per my prepared remarks, I think at this point, we are effectively at or better than pre-pandemic levels across most of our customer classes. And so we feel good about the economic conditions in Michigan, and we continue to see very attractive leading indicators. And I think it's also worth noting that of the percentages I just shared with you, that does not take into account the energy waste reduction programs we have that reduced our load year-over-year by 1.5% to 2%. So when you exclude that, that performance looks even better.  So we feel very good on the retail sales side, but again, obviously, the pandemic still with us. But Garrick, if you have any other comments. Anthony, the only thing I would add just to get into some of the specifics of the IRP from a capacity perspective, and to Garrick comment, this is why we feel quite good about energy security and reliability, however you want to refer to it, is that the Colbert facility is going to bring over 1.1 gigawatts of capacity. Again, assuming the settlement agreement is approved. We're also going to RFP shortly after approval. If all goes according to plan, the 700-megawatt tranche of PPA opportunity by 2025, and so that offers additional capacity. And again, 500 megawatts of that will be local dispatchable capacity.  We're also extending the retirement or delaying the retirement of Karn 3 and 4, which also provides over a gigawatt of capacity. And so again, we're taking, obviously, affordability into account. We're taking reliability into account and we're taking, obviously, the clean aspects of our plan into account, and that's what we feel good about. Not just the economics for all stakeholders, but most importantly, reliability."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thanks, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. I'm pleased to share the great progress we have made over the quarter and with our IRP.  You've heard me speak about our simple investment thesis on many of these calls. It has withstood the test of time, and this quarter was no different. The industry leading at 0 commitments. These aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. Our IRP settlement paves the way to be out of coal by 2025, one of the first utilities in the nation to achieve such a milestone. Our recently announced net 0 goal for our gas system, not just a dream but evident and proof point in our net 0 methane target and a 20% reduction in customer emissions by 2030.  Excellent through the CE way. I can't think of a more important time given inflation and supply chain constraints for our industry-leading cost management muscle will play out. Reggie will walk through specifics in his prepared remarks, but I continue to be confident in our ability to offset inflationary pressure and alleviate supply chain concerns. This means keeping customer bills affordable through our CE way lean operating system.  Top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. The IRP settlement once again demonstrates a constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, delivering important, industry-leading outcomes for all. I'd be remiss if I didn't thank the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, Michigan Attorney General, customer groups, environmental organizations, energy trade representatives and the Consumers Energy work team for the constructive dialogue led to settlement in a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the environment for future generations.  All of this, along with the fundamentals of our simple but impactful investment thesis, leads to a consistent premium total shareholder return for you, our investors. At CMS Energy, we deliver for all our stakeholders. This is why you own us and what you can count on.  Now, let me get on with sharing the great news of the IRP and our quarter. I'm thrilled with this settlement. It provides a 20-year blueprint to meet Michigan's energy needs while protecting the future -- the environment for the future generations and ensuring financial certainty. You've heard me say before, our IRP is a win for everyone, and let me share with you why.  Our customers will see significant savings in addition to cleaner and more reliable energy. We're accelerating our ESG ambitions to decarbonize and lead the way to protect our planet, exiting coal operations and achieving a 60% carbon emission reduction by 2025, growing our solar bill to 8 gigawatts and accelerating 75 megawatts of battery storage between now and 2027.  Our investors will see capital upside along with the purchase of the Colbert plant and economic incentives and demand-side programs, as well as the continuation of a financial compensation mechanism, FCM, on purchase power agreement, PPAs. We also received regulatory asset treatment at an ROE of 9% on our retired coal asset through the remaining design lives.  This settlement agreement is closely aligned with our original filing, but most notably, we dropped the purchase of CMS Enterprise assets and instead will pursue long-term PPAs of 700 megawatts of Michigan-based capacity starting in 2025. While we believe the purchase of the CMS Enterprise assets was a good value for customers, our primary concern was ensuring we secured sufficient capacity to meet our customers' needs. The proposed RFP, coupled with the purchase of the Colbert plant and a delayed retirement with a Karn 3 and 4 peaking unit will address this concern.  DIG and the peakers and enterprises will have an opportunity to participate in this RFP, but we'll otherwise continue to sell capacity as they've done in the past in the attractive bilateral market. This is a win for everyone.  In March, we announced plans to achieve net 0 carbon emissions for our natural gas system by 2050, which includes both our customers' and our suppliers' emissions. This adds to our long-term plan, both electric and natural gas, to further drive decarbonization and provides meaningful proof points along the clean energy transformation. Net 0 emissions across our natural gas system is certainly an ambitious target, however, we've modeled this extensively. We believe it's achievable. The lowest cost and most reliable transition to a clean energy future is through existing infrastructure in a clean fuel network.  It also acknowledges that there are thoughtful ways to reduce and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions across important home heating and thermal electric generation resources. Both are important in ensuring long-term affordability and reliability for our customers.  As we've demonstrated across our electric system with this IRP, these aren't just words. They are evident in our actions and our results. The proof points are in both our net 0 methane target and 20% reduction in gas customer emissions by 2030, and we're delivering on those plans and investment opportunities. This includes accelerating vintage main and service replacement and adding renewable natural gas to our system, all included in our 5-year capital investment plan. It also means greater energy efficiency, carbon offsets and potential hydrogen blending, which provide growth opportunities above our plan, strengthening and lengthening our investment horizon.  Our decarbonization plan is good for our customers, our planet and our investors. This is an important road ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress.  Like I shared at the beginning of my remarks, we've had a great quarter. We're off to a strong start of the year on all fronts. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.20. This is up $0.11 per share from last year ahead of our plan and positions us well as we start the year, giving us confidence as we navigate the 9 months ahead. We are reaffirming our 2022 adjusted full year guidance of $2.85 to $2.89 per share, and we continue to guide to the high end of our long-term adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%. The IRP strengthens and lengthen our ability to deliver on our earnings glide path going forward. Looking forward, we continue to see long-term dividend growth of 6% to 8% with a target payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Today, we are reaffirming our $14.3 billion 5-year customer investment plan. As we've noted, the IRP does provide upsides to our current plan, but we'll remain disciplined in our approach. You can expect to see that update as we report fourth quarter results early next year.  As I often say, strong execution leads to strong results, and this quarter was another impressive example. We are confident in the full year guidance, and we are focused on delivering for our customers, the planet and you, our investors.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Rejji. Great question, Mike. Let's start here. This is a great settlement, but there's an important regulatory process that we're still in the midst of. And just like back in 2018 and 2019, there's a few parties that can contest the settlement. That's pretty difficult. We anticipate that to occur over the next month in the regulatory proceeding. There's a schedule for that, a calendar for that, that occurs over the month of May. And then the commissioners will issue an order, which we anticipate in late June. It could drift into July, but we anticipate late June at this point.  So I do not want to be out in front of the commissioners on this and put the cart in front of the horse per se, but here's what I'll tell you on this. We feel good about the settlement and the ability because the number of parties are on, and to be able to navigate that process. So what it means from a plan perspective is, as we've shared, that strengthen and lengthen our plan and gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the 6% to 8% towards the high end. As we shared, this is, again, upside to the plan, IRP is upside of the plan.  And here's how I'd think about it. We know and we've certainly made it clear that in 2023, Colbert comes in the plan in the May time frame. That's good from a planning perspective. But remember, this important piece in the 6% to 8%. We deliver each and every year, and then we rebase off of actuals, so that's an important piece. It's that compounding, a quarterly -- compounding it. It's the quality of earnings, which you've come to know and expect. And frankly, that allows us to do the strengthening and lengthening across the broader land. No, I don't -- we don't do sugar highs. There's -- We've got nearly 20 years of consistent financial performance, I mean, and we're going to deliver -- our plan here is to deliver year '20. And so again, I think there's strengthening, lengthening of that plan comes from the ability to be at 6% to 8% towards the high end. We've got great confidence in that, but also this rebasing.  Each and every year, you know our history, we deliver and then we rebase off actuals, and that provides a nice opportunity to strengthen the length of the plan. I feel really good about this rate case that we're filing. And I'm, again, confident in this regulatory construct. There's been a number of signals here over the last quarter that gives me confidence in the regulatory construct. Let me start there. We had a rehearing on our electric rate case. That was a positive. For a small dollars, but a positive. Our gas rate case, we had SaaS position. The initial valley was constructive and a great starting spot in this IRP settlement with staff, with the Attorney General provides another data point that speaks to the constructive nature of this. We took feedback after the last electric rate case, I shared that in the last earnings call, and we rewrote a lot of our testimony, specifically in the area of electric reliability. Enhance and bolstered our business cases.  And so this is going to be a step change and is a step change in our filing. And I always share we have more work that we're working on to continuously improve that rate case process, but I feel good about our filing. It's primarily made up of electric reliability and resiliency work, important work to deliver for our customers. There's also the Colbert facility is in there. There's a little bit of work on economic development. We've seen a lot of growth here in the state to support that work and this broader clean energy transformation. And so I feel good about the case and the strength of the case and getting a good outcome. Rejji, you will start with the financing piece, and then we can bounce back and forth on your other questions. Yes. From an RFP perspective, what we agreed to in the settlement is 700 -- equivalent of 700 megawatts of a portion of it -- some of our megawatts of load out there, capacity out there. The 500 megawatts is dispatchable, and that's the nature of that and available, reliable generation in the state. And then 200 megawatts is in the category of renewables, again, purchase power agreements.  For those purchase power agreements that are not associated with the affiliate, there's the opportunity to earn a financial compensation mechanism on those. And enterprise has the opportunity to bid in to that 700 megawatts, primarily in the 500 megawatts that are dispatchable in nature. And so that's the nature of the RFP.  In terms of Palisades, it's important to remember, we're not the owner or operator of Palisades. We've not been involved in any conversations with the Department of Energy. And if for specific questions in this call on Palisades, I'd really direct them to Entergy specific to the plant.  Now our governor has came back -- has came out in support of keeping Palisades operational. We're certainly supportive of our governor and the administration and in even a broader context, we believe in nuclear energy as part of the solution here for reliable, dispatchable and clean energy across our nation in Michigan. Our PPA on that facility expires here at the end of May. It is an expensive purchase power agreement, and as we've shared in the course of this call, we're laser-focused on reducing costs for our customers, and so that is front and center for us.  We'd certainly entertain a long-term purchase power agreement, a new purchase power agreement with the facility entertaining discussions and conversation about that, but it does have to be at a competitive price. That will be an important factor. And then also, we expect to receive on of -- a stand on that new PPA as well. Well, in our 5-year plan, there's a hefty amount. There's about $5 billion, a little more. It's aimed at decarbonization of our natural gas system. Again, it's multiple benefits. You're out there replacing old pipe, vintage pipe as we call it in services. It makes the system safer, improves reliability of natural gas system, also eliminates methane emissions, one of the leading causes of climate change. And so we've got a target of net 0 by 2030, so those investments are being made right now over the course of the 5 years and will extend into the 10-year plan as well.  We see our renewable natural gas is also part of that solution. It is part of this gas rate case that's underway right now. If you get into the details of staff's position, they were not supportive of that renewable natural gas. However, they left an opening in there, which we think we can mitigate in the course of rebuttal, and move that into the utility. There's some work to be done there in our gas case. Everyone in this sector and even outside the sector, it's been inflation. To me, the bigger question is who do you think is best at managing that? And I would put us up to the top of the list. Our ability to leverage CE way and provide cost savings for our customers is certainly -- again, we talked about it as flexing our muscle here.  We got great examples of that in 2020. We saw sales drop. We find $100 million of savings in the organization. We've got in 2021, in August, we had $0.16 of impact just to storms. We offset that. We have an amazing ability to be able to leverage the tools of the CE way and then plus automation, I would add, to be able to mitigate costs. And so Rejji went through a number of examples in the way we manage that across the system.  And so long term, when we look at our 5-year plan. And even in the short term, there's a nice ability to manage rates and keep them affordable for our customers. In line with kind of traditional inflation, you might say, but I feel confident in our plan to be able to mitigate much of the impact of inflation going forward. I think, Rejji, I'll tag team this one. Bottom line is it's something that Enterprise is going to consider. Again, I'm not certain we'll participate in that. We have potential to participate in that RFP, and we'll make that evaluation. The capacity market is certainly, as we've seen across MISO, an opportunity as well and -- for upside with our enterprise assets. And so if there's an evaluation, we'll participate in it and take a look at the impact of how Big participates either in the bilateral market or our bid into this longer-term PPA with the utility. I would anticipate, at least initially here, is that our RFP would be issued within the fiscal year 2022. I'll start with the punch line or the bottom line. No material impact to the 5-year plan, continued confidence in our 2022 guidance and then continued confidence in the longer-term plan, the 5 years and the 6% to 8% and meeting toward the high end. So that's the bottom line. Let me tell you why.  This IRP is 8 gigawatts. It's not 8 gigawatts tomorrow or even in the 5-year plan. We have 15 to 20 years to build this out. So there's considerable on flexibility to be able to construct that. And just like everyone else in the industry, the Department of Commerce and this investigation slowed things up in some of our projects. But these are megawatts that are going to get built. These are renewable projects that are going to get built because they're part of our broader IRP in nature. But again, let me try to offer some context from a size perspective.  We're building out own generation here, about 150 megawatts per year. So we're talking about 2 projects. In 2024, we go up to 250 megawatts per year. And so this annual capital spend is around $200 million to $250 million. This is manageable, easily manageable. And in fact, this is -- I've been in operations for 20 years. This is work that happens every year. There's stuff that goes in and out of the plan based on a lot of different variables, and so easily manageable from a capital perspective.  In fact, and just as a reminder, we have $3 billion to $4 billion of capital backlog in things like electric reliability, investments in our gas system. 80% of those projects are less than $200 million, so there's ability to put them into the plan and offer real value for our customers.  The other important part of this clean energy journey, as well as a reminder here, that although solar has been impacted, we're still progressing with wind in the state of Michigan and we're investing a lot in the space of our hydro facilities. We have 15 hydro facilities here. There's smart and thoughtful investments occurring there as well. And those are on progress, on target. And so I feel good about that from where we're headed from a clean energy perspective.  And the last piece that I'll also point to, and I think this is important from a capacity perspective. And I noted in my prepared remarks that Karn 3 and 4 continues to operate to 2031. Karn 3 and 4, we originally proposed retiring in 2023. So this settlement offers some additional flexibility from a capacity build perspective. And so again, we've got some flexibility to weather things and be able to meet all our customers' needs.  So again, we feel good about the capital plan, confident in our earnings guidance both in the year and in the long term. The enterprise assets are an important part of our portfolio. It's small but important, it makes about 4% of our earnings mix. And again, this goes back a little bit. We used to talk about the Ferrari in the garage and then it was a Tesla in the garage. It's probably the new electric Corvette in the garage. I don't know how you want to say it. But with capacity prices, there's some certainties of upside here in some of our -- in some of our Big and some of the Peakers.  But by and large, this business is about renewables and customer-focused renewables. And it's small in nature, and we deliver strategic solutions for our customers. Hasn't changed, but it continues to be a consistent performer for our business. I want to bring that back. It's -- it's a great asset for us. It's roughly 800 megawatts, a little shy of 800 megawatts. I think it's around 780 megawatts for Palisades. In line with the Governor's letter, we're certainly open to conversations and discussions. We've had some conversations more just to understand the complexities of the situation to understand what's going on. But nothing that's really got to any level of seriousness on a long-term purchase power agreement. Two pieces there that's really, really important. And it does have to be a competitive purchase power agreement, so I'll reemphasize that component of it as well. And if we were to consider that and have those -- and have those conversations, again, we would expect financial compensation mechanism on those as well.  Again, it just provides additional flexibility for us in clean energy. And so we'll be a little bit long from a capacity perspective, but there's opportunities to think about different investments and give us a little more flexibility in our -- even further flexibility in our solar build-out. Yes. So Jonathan, we still feel good about the revenue opportunities at DIG, particularly now that we don't foresee it being part of the IRP. And so I'm going to go from memory, but we were somewhere around $35 million of revenue or pre-tax earnings associated with DIG and we still think that that's a pretty good base case to run. And what we're also seeing, probably unsurprisingly, is a tightening of the bilateral capacity market, which I think Garrick had accurately noted as attractive in his prepared remarks because we do continue to see it tighten and we do expect to see even more attractive capacity and energy opportunities on the contracted side at DIG.  So I'd say base case, it's good to be around that $35 million area, but there's certainly upside opportunities in the coming years if we continue to participate in that bilateral market. So, yes. So that's -- Yes. So that working assumption was if the bilateral market went to CONE, which was at the time around $7.50 per kilowatt month. And so in the event the bilateral market continues to tighten and gets to those levels, that certainly could be within the realm of possibility to see upside at that level, but we're certainly not planning for that given our nature. But yes, it could be an opportunity over time if we continue to see Zone 7 tighten. I wouldn't put it that way. Here's the process of an integrated resource plan. We do loss of load expectations study. There's a number of other variables. We look at it from a system reliability perspective. And so it's an important mix of renewables and batteries, particularly in part of the plan, but also dispatchable generation. So you're getting things like gas, at least in our case, natural gas and part of the plan. And so all those come together.  And this plan that we submitted was more reliable than our previous IRP in terms of the -- in terms of the build-out. And then our extension of Karn 3 and 4, again, it was planned to be retired in 2023 and extending that to 2031, continues to provide additional reliability over the course of this decade. Well, broader, we have -- again, I look at the our 10-year, 15, 20 years, there's ample capital upside. And we have about $3 billion to $4 billion of capital that's not in the plan that are specific projects identified that improve our gas system, more replacement of mains that looks at reliability and resiliency. We've got a large $5.5 billion focus on that. I mean, much of that is in this electric rate case to improve reliability for our customers. Those are the things that fit into that plan and continue to have that long horizon of capital investment opportunities. The IRP won't have any impact on our rate case proceedings. So we'll continue to stay -- the main plan is just to go with annual rate cases. But on occasion, we do stay out for a year, and we have. Our gas case is a great example that we've been out for 2 years and are in for a case right now. Yes. Let me be clear, the RFP for that 700-megawatt tranche of PPA, and again, it's going to be 2 tranches, 1500 megawatts of dispatchable local and 200 megawatts of other. The RFP would commence this year, but we would not effectuate the PPAs until the 2025 time frame. And so you wouldn't see any of the earnings associated with those financial compensation mechanism until that time frame.  I also want to be very clear that in the event Enterprises participates in that 500-megawatt tranche, then they would not be eligible for the FCM or we would not be eligible for the FCM. Well, yes, to be very clear, it's certainly an opportunity for DIG, particularly or specifically for that 500-megawatt tranche, which is essentially going to be earmarked for local stackable -- a local dispatchable resource. And so certainly, DIG would qualify for that, and so that is certainly an opportunity.  And as we think about the alternatives as fiduciaries, they could certainly participate in that or DIG could participate in that. And a 10-year PPA, if DIG prevails, that's not an -- that's a pretty attractive alternative depending on where the economics end up. But as I mentioned earlier, we're also seeing a very attractive bilateral market shaping up here in Zone 7, just with continued tightening. And so we are seeing levels that are in excess from our existing capacity contracts and energy contracts, and so we'll weigh the alternatives once the RFP comes around and see what we'll do there.  On the 200 megawatts, obviously, DIG wouldn't be eligible for that. But we'll see what else comes around, and we'll get an FCM on that. And so we're not presupposing any of those economics in the EPS I noted in my prepared remarks, but it certainly creates an opportunity for DIG without a doubt. I think the important part of that clean energy spend in those 2 years you referenced is it's not all solar. There's a good portion of hydro and wind in there, and so again, we're talking about into $200 million, $250 million that would be on an annual basis that would be in the solar area. So it's -- that's the difference. Is that helpful? That's great. Again, we'll take a look at this 5-year plan. We're building it out right now, and we'll share it here in Q4. Obviously, Colbert is a big piece of it. Those other areas within the IRP as well. We accelerated 75 megawatts of battery storage into the years of 2024 and 2027, so that has to be incorporated in as new capital upside in that 5-year plan. Extension of Karn 3 and 4 has some impact as well. So those are all additions and things that need to be worked through from a capital plan.  In terms of the voluntary green pricing, that also continues to progress nicely with our customers as they subscribe. We build out that plan. We've issued an RFP for that work. I haven't seen the results of that yet. It's still out there, but that would be a -- potentially solar could be other renewables build in the 2024 to 2027 time line. So that's -- upside is, again, we plan conservatively, is materializing, so we're not ready to announce that yet. But directionally, it looks good. Is that helpful? We're all hoping it is over, too. Rejji, walk through sales piece a little bit, and then I'll talk more on some macro factors. So maybe just touch on sales, Rejji. Yes, so just some quick macro factors. So Bloomberg recognized Michigan is the number one economy -- the state economy coming out post-pandemic, and so that's certainly a highlight. They've been recognized as the top state for foreign direct investment, over 14 -- really approaching 15,000 different firms that are located here in Michigan, 5,000 different locations. The big announcement with General Motors, but it's not just General Motors, there's a host of other things from manufacturing to agriculture and then agricultural processing that have grown here in the state.  So I feel good by the broader economic trends that we're seeing here in Michigan as well. Paul. Our electric rate case and our plan underway certainly looks at improving electric liability across the state to improve value for our customers. And so that's well underway. This legislation that was introduced, we don't anticipate getting any traction without a committee. That's the short of it. Well, let me say. The first question is Rocco's great. Austin is really performing well during those calls as well. Shout out to Austin. But bottom line, from the earnings guide path we had with EnerBank, we see a clear path to do so. And I would suggest that we're on that path for all the reasons I stated earlier in regards to my response to Mike. And so I feel good about where we're heading, and confident here in that growth rate in the future. I would argue that we're focused on both. Again, we can't sacrifice one for the other, and so this IRP that's settled here does both. It allows us for that clean energy transformation as well as ensuring reliability and security of the state.  And so again, there's always some policymakers and legislators that are looking at that, and we're going to continue to look at opportunities from a capital investment perspective. But again, we feel really good about our 5-year plan to balance both reliability security of the grid as well as planet. And I would add to it, our customers and ensuring that it's affordable. And Rejji, why don't you add something as well? Same Well, thank you, Austin. Nice job for our first time with Austin. And I'd like to thank all our callers and investors for joining us today. Take care and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.  This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 P.M. Eastern Time running through February 8. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSrikanth Maddipati: Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. As some of you may know, this will be my last earnings call, as I've transitioned to a new role in the company, responsible for electric supply and the implementation of the New Energy Law. While I'm excited for my new role and responsibilities, I will miss working with all of you in the investment community so closely. I want to thank you for the support you've all given me in this company.  Jason Shore, a 25-year veteran at CMS, has been named Treasurer and VP of Investor Relations. As I hand over the baton, I'm confident in Jason and our very experienced [indiscernible].  And now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow : Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get started, I want to thank Sri for his leadership in the finance area, and I look forward to his continued growth and impact as he takes on this important role in electric supply, where he'll lead critical filings like our renewable energy plan and integrated resource plan, which I will discuss later in this call.  We have a deep bench of talent at CMS Energy. And it is critically important that we develop our leaders in key areas of the business, continuing to strengthen the bench, build dexterity, and provide challenging growth opportunities. I know both Sri And Jason will make a big impact in their new roles. I've shared before on these calls, this isn't our first rodeo. The CMS team delivers now 21 years of exceptional performance. I am proud to share with you the highlights of the year. And I am proud of this team. You will see in the numbers and our operational highlight, 2023 was an incredible year. We met and faced challenges that tested our team and we rose to the occasion.  First, let's talk about the weather. The 2022/2023 winter was in that top 10 warmest on record. And then there was summer. When much of the world saw temperature warmer temperatures, our summer, influenced by El Nino conditions, was cooler than normal. And then, December 2023, the second warmest December on record. Add to that, record storm activity within our service territory. To say the least, it was a challenging year.  Despite severe storms and unfavorable weather, we delivered and offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, serving our customers with heat and light and keeping our financial commitments for our investors. This world class team comes together and we do what we say we will do year in and year out. No excuses, just results.  As I said earlier, I'm proud of the team at CMS Energy. There are a number of great things we delivered in the year, even more than are represented on slide 4. In the interest of time, I want to hit on just a few. I want to highlight the Freedom Award from the Secretary of Defense, and why this is so special. This is the highest recognition a company can receive for supporting their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve. The nomination was submitted by one of our employees and demonstrates the commitment of our entire company. This is an important part of our culture, to support and care for our people. And to honor our coworkers who serve our customers and our country.  We continue our focus on leading the clean energy transformation. In 2023. we retire over 500 megawatts of coal, further reducing our carbon footprint. Alongside these retirements, we ensured resource adequacy with the acquisition of the 1.2 gigawatt Covert natural gas generating station and brought online our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm. This thoughtful transition ensures customer reliability as we move our portfolio from coal to clean.  I also want to give a shout out to our small, but important NorthStar Clean Energy team. They performed well in 2023, exceeding our expectations for the year, completing the Newport solar project and demonstrating strong operational performance at Dearborn industrial generation, DIG. Another solid year of execution at CMS Energy across the triple bottom line, delivering industry leading, sustainable premium growth.  In 2023, Michigan also passed new energy legislation, starting the course for cleaner energy in Michigan, while maintaining resource adequacy, customer affordability and strengthening our financial plan. This legislation speaks to the constructive Financial Plan.  This legislation speaks to the constructive nature of Michigan, provides more incentives to grow our clean energy portfolio, furthering investment opportunities with increased certainty of recovery.  Now, it's still early days. We're evaluating all aspects of the new law, including the strategic advantage of owning versus contract and supply, the increased incentive on PPAs and what makes the most sense for us and for our customers.  The law provides a lot of flexibility and options, which is important. You'll see this play out in a couple of upcoming filings. I want to draw your attention to the Renewable Energy Plan. This is not a new filing, but becomes a more important input in the Integrated Resource Plan. The Renewable Energy Plan will detail our plan to meet the 60% renewable portfolio standard by 2035.  As you might imagine, this work is underway. We plan to file in the second half of the year. Following our renewable energy plan filing, our next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan is due in 2027. Together, the Renewable Energy Plan and Integrated Resource Plan will align our supply resources to deliver cost competitive, cleaner, and reliable energy as we target net zero. They also provide important transparency and certainty as we advance the business forward with investments in renewables and clean energy.  Michigan Energy Law continues to support its strong regulatory environment and needed customer investments. While the recent legislation provides opportunities to file our updated Renewable Energy Plan, the regulatory calendar is fairly routine in 2024. Our electric rate case continues toward a constructive outcome. We've seen positive indicators with key stakeholder support for recovery of customer investments and important investment mechanisms, such as the IRM and our undergrounding pilot. We expect an order from the Commission on or before March 1.  We filed our gas rate case in mid-December, with an ask of $136 million with a 10.25% ROE and in a 51.5% equity ratio. The request lines with needed investments outlined in our 10-year natural gas delivery plan. We expect an order for the end of the year.  On slide 7, we've highlighted our new five-year, $17 billion utility customer investment plan, which supports approximately 7.5% rate base growth through 2028. You will note that about 40% of our customer investment opportunities support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gases, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. The plan also includes an increased investment in the electric distribution system to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers.  We also have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. These include adders built into legislation for incentives on energy efficiency programs and the financial compensation mechanism we earn on PPA that I mentioned earlier.  We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy, as they see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at DIG.  It's important to note we have a long and robust runway of additional investment opportunities both within and beyond the five-year window. As an example, we've incorporated a little less than half of the incremental $3 billion of customer investments associated with our electric reliability roadmap. We've also not yet included the customer investments associated with the new energy law. These will be included in our renewable energy plan filing and will provide more opportunities for investment.  I feel good about our five-year utility investment plan. It is focused on our customers. It positions the business for continued success and delivers for all stakeholders.  With that, I'll conclude with the 2023 results and long term outlook before passing it over to Rejji, who will cover the financials in more detail.  2023, no excuses, not weather, not storms, just results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 or the high end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2024 adjusted full-year EPS guidance $0.02 to $3.29 to $3.35 from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, compounding off of 2023 actual result. Let me repeat, compounding off of actuals. That is a differentiator in this sector.  We continue to expect to be toward the high end of our 2024 guidance range, which points to our confidence as we start the year.  Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $2.06 per share for 2024. Longer term, we continue to guide for the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7%, up to 8%. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to grow the dividend. You'll see that we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Finally, we remain confident in our plan for 2024 and beyond, given our longstanding inability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes : Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2023, with adjusted net income of $907 million, which translates to $3.11 per share, toward the high end of our guidance range.  The key drivers of our 2023 financial performance included strong cost performance throughout the organization, fueled by CE Way, a solid beat at NorthStar and a variety of non-operational countermeasures, such as liability management and tax planning, which more than offset the significant weather-related headwinds experienced throughout the year.  And to further underscore the magnitude of cost performance delivered by our workforce, our fourth quarter operating and maintenance, or O&M, expense, exclusive of service restoration and vegetation management, was approximately 25% below the comparable period in 2022 and over 20% below our five year average for this cost category, a truly impressive achievement.  All in, we managed to offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, without compromising our operational commitments to our customers and the communities we serve.  At CMS, we've had plenty of years of adversity, followed by impressive operational and financial beat, but I can't recall one quite like 2023, a year in which our workforce personified grit and displayed that perennial will to deliver for all stakeholders.  To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2023, on slide 10, you'll note that we've met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $178 million of equity forward contracts in November and settled the remaining roughly $265 million in forwards in January. As a reminder, these forwards are pricing levels favorable to our planning assumption.  The only financial target missed in 2023 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $3.7 billion. We ended the year below that, at $3.3 billion, primarily due to siting and permitting delays at select solar projects. As mentioned in the past, we fully intend to build out all of the solar projects approved in IRP and voluntary green pricing [indiscernible]. And with the Michigan Renewable Energy siting reform bill passed last fall, we should see better progress here going forward.  Moving to our 2024 EPS guidance on slide 11. We are raising our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3.29 to $3.35 per share from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, as Garrick noted, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range.  As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, providing $3.74 to $3.80 of adjusted earnings, the details of which I'll cover on the next slide. At NorthStar, we're assuming EPS contribution of $0.16 to $0.18, which reflects strong underlying performance, primarily DIG, and ongoing contributions from our renewables business.  Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment and our 2024 guidance range assumes the absence of liability management transactions. As always, we'll remain opportunistic in this regard, and we'll look to capitalize on attractive market conditions, should they arise.  To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall chart on slide 12. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are measured on a full-year basis and are relative to 2023.  From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather which in this case amounts to $0.43 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the absence of the atypically mild temperatures experienced throughout 2023. Additionally, we anticipate $0.23 of EPS pickup, attributable rate relief, really driven by the residual benefits of last year's constructive gas rate case settlement and assumed supportive outcomes on our pending electric and gas rate cases. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, which is depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense.  As we turn to our cost structure in 2024, you'll note $0.16 per share of positive variance due to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way, the ongoing benefits of cost reduction measures implemented in 2023, which was our voluntary separation plan which reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%, and initiatives already underway. It is also worth noting that our cost assumptions exclude the impact of the catastrophic ice storm we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.  Lastly, in the penultimate bar, on the right hand side, you'll notice significant negative variance, which largely consists of the reversal of select one-time cost reduction measures. These are partially offset by the ongoing benefits of our well executed financing plan in 2023, and we're assuming the usual conservative assumptions around whether normalized sales, taxes and non-utility performance, among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.58 to $0.64 per square of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors.  On slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll focus my remarks on those metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly, as we balance the needs of the business.  As previously mentioned, we have already settled the remaining equity forwards and have no additional equity needs in 2024. Longer term, we intend to resume our at the market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year beginning in 2025 and extending through 2028, which is essentially the same assumption in our previous five year plan, but for the extension of an additional year. We're able to maintain our pre-existing equity needs despite an increase in utility capital plan, given the expectation of strong operating cash flow generation and the ability to monetize tax credits, courtesy of Inflation Reduction Act.  It is also worth noting that this morning's decision by Moody's to increase the equity credit ascribed to junior subordinated notes, which represents about 40% of our debt at the parent company, is not embedded in our plan, thus providing further cushion in these metrics.  Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2024, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, over half of which has been opportunistically issued as noted on the page. And the coupon rate on this newly issued debt is favorable to plan, thus providing a helpful tailwind as we start the year.  Over the coming year, we have no planned long term financings at the parent and already redeemed at full maturity in January at par. Longer term, we have relatively modest near term maturities at the parent, with $250 million due in 2025 and $300 million due in 2026.  On slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized.  Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, our diverse and battle tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance.  Before I hand it back to Garrick, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to echo Garrick's praise of Sri, whom I've worked closely with over the past seven years. Sri's contributions to the finance team and the company have been immeasurable since he joined CMS. So thank you, Sri. You're leaving it better than you found it, and I look forward to working with you and Jason in your new roles.  And with that, I'll pass it on to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow : Thank you, Rejji. You all know this last slide very well by now. Over two decades, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. Given the challenges of 2023, I'm extremely proud of the team's effort. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business. It has withstood the test of time, and provides us confidence for a strong outlook in 2024 and beyond.  With that, Emily, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question comes from the line of Nick Campanella with Barclays.\nNicholas Campanella: Sri, great work with you all these years. Best of luck in the new role. Just to get started, could you maybe just help us understand the DIG uplift and kind of context of the current 6% to 8% CAGR? You have some open capacity there. The current run rates are clearly higher. Just what's the timeline to lock that in? And how should we kind of think about the uplift to the 6% to 8% or perhaps just adding higher visibility in extending the 6% to 8% for even longer?\nGarrick Rochow: Those traditional, what I call, outside of base growth, so those growth drivers outside of traditional rate base \u2013 energy efficiency, financial compensation mechanism and DIG \u2013 those are powerful in the plan.  And you asked specifically about Dearborn Industrial Generation. We are seeing both energy and capacity of prices elevated, particularly in the out years of the plan. We have available capacity beyond 2026 out through the plan. We're layering in contracts, really as we speak, which with attractive numbers and which gives us confidence in our plan, particularly in the out-years through DIG.\nNicholas Campanella: On the REP plan, I guess if you file second half of 2024, can you just help us understand regulatory process? When would there be a decision there? Or what does that kind of look like? And then how does that kind of flow through to your CapEx plan? Would it be like this time next year we kind of get an update on how that flows through? \nGarrick Rochow: First of all, this is not a new filing. It is a more important filing. It is a bigger filing. As you might imagine, if you're going to achieve 60% renewable by 2035 or 50% by 2030, it has to grow from a size perspective. So it takes on increased importance.  It's also important to remember it's based on energy versus the Integrated Resource Plan, which is based on capacity. So that work is underway. And it's really a spectrum. To meet that standard, do you do all PPAs? That's one bookend. Or do you do all ownership?  I view it somewhere in the middle. But what's the strength of this energy law is there's a lot of flexibility to be able to start that path to those clean energy ambitions. We've got to think about what the customer impact is. We're still required as a load serving entity to meet resource capacity constraints in the IRP. So that's a consideration. We've got to look at the balance sheet. And here's a really capital light option where we can get an FCM at 9%. That's a really attractive part of this energy law. So there's a lot of dynamics that have to play out in there. That work is underway right now.  We will file that Renewable Energy Plan in the second half of the year. We have until 2025 to get it done, but we want to pull that forward into 2024, given the work that has to be done and these milestones that are out there.  So we'll file that. The commission has and staff has 10 months to get to a final order. And then that information there will certainly aid our capital plan and the upside from an FCM mechanism, but also flows into our Integrated Resource Plan. And that Integrated Resource Plan should become less complex because of this Renewable Energy Plan work.  Ultimately, that then flows into rate cases as we move forward over time on the annual frequency.  So, I know Rejji has some more comments on this as well. So, I'll pass it to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: All I would add to Garrick's good comments is, as you think about that trajectory and sequencing the Garrick laid out, it's important to note that the plan that we laid out today, that takes you from 2024 to 2028 does not incorporate any capital investment opportunities associated with the new legislation. And so, as we file the REP in the second half of this year and then get feedback presumably in the second half of 2025, we won't start incorporating capital opportunities, most likely for a couple of vintages of five year plans. Now, we have started to layer in the energy waste reduction or energy efficiency opportunities, as well as modest portion of the FCM opportunities. But I think in subsequent five year plans, you'll start to see more FCM-related opportunities and certainly more capital opportunities, but it's going to take a couple of vintages before we have real clarity on that. Is that helpful? \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to touch base, I guess, a little bit more on the Moody's change this morning. If you could just walk us through that a bit and quantify how much equity credit that is, just trying to get a sense for what that means. \nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, this is Rejji. So, Moody's this morning increased the equity credit that they ascribe to junior subordinated notes, which are more informally referred to as hybrids. It was previously a 25% equity credit. And they're essentially now at parity with S&P at 50%.  The reason why that's impactful for us is that we've issued those securities quite a bit over the last five to six years, and so currently represents about 40% of our debt portfolio at the holdco. And so, by them, increasing the equity credit ascribed to this, it really increases, I'd say, the FFO to debt metrics at Moody's by that 50 to 60 basis points. So fairly accretive from a credit perspective to plan.\nJeremy Tonet: As we approach finalizing the electric rate case, just wondering if you could provide any more incremental thoughts, I guess, on how you feel about how things are progressing there. Just any color will be appreciated.\nGarrick Rochow: Jeremy, things are progressing nicely. I feel good about a constructive outcome. Staff had a great starting spot on what I think can be a constructive outcome and feel confident that we can get there. There's a lot of positive indicators. Support for the important work on reliability. I would say there's a great alignment between staff and, frankly, the commissioners on where we want to go, improve reliability in the state. That's a big part of this electric rate case. And also, positive indicators on the mechanisms that we've talked about in the past, this infrastructure recovery mechanism. We think that's really important from a go forward reliability perspective. It also lines up with [indiscernible] have shared about ring fencing and providing opportunity to capital to see the insight of where those investments are and how they make a difference. And then, finally, our undergrounding pilot. That's seeing support as well. That's an important first step in this resiliency play and our larger ambitions that are evident in our reliability roadmap.  So, again, I feel really good about where the case is headed. And we expect the final order on or before March 1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: Just a real quick cleanup question on the CapEx and rate base. Is part of the rate base CAGR increase to that firm 7.5% and the higher CapEx run rate, is that driven by some of the spending and solar delays in 2023, so slightly off, maybe a lower base and timing differences? Or is it driven by new CapEx, the tail end of the plan, or maybe a combination of both, especially since you guys don't really include a lot of CapEx until we get through the approval process right.\nRejji Hayes: I would say it's largely due to the latter and that's incremental CapEx. So, remember, we have the electrical liability roadmap that we provided \u2013 that we filed with the commission in late September of last year. And so, that had $3 billion of incremental CapEx opportunity versus the prior vintage. We haven't incorporated all of that. But about half is, as per Garrick's prepared remarks, so call it roughly a good portion of that $1.5 billion step up in our new plan versus our old plan.  We also do have increased renewable investments. But I wouldn't say that that's sort of the deferrals that are coming into 2024 from 2023. Yes, there's a little bit of that, but it's largely an additional IRP execution on the renewable side, as well as our voluntary green pricing program. So I'd say the vast majority of that uplift from our five year CapEx plan, the current one versus the prior, is driven by electrical liability related investments, and then you've got a portion attributable to clean energy investments, largely renewables. \nGarrick Rochow: Let me just reinforce that. And the way I would like to think about, add on to Rejji's good comments there, is that clean energy piece in the supply, it's what's approved in our 2022 IRP. And the upside will be to the tail end because we haven't built in any of this new energy law, as Rejji stated in some earlier comments. So, as that renewable energy plan is filed and eventually approved, then you'll see that it will slightly hit the tail, but even beyond the five years, you can see a nice path of 10 years of investment opportunity as a result of this energy law.\nShahriar Pourreza: It just sounds like it's more incremental versus shifting from 2023 to 2024. Okay. And then, just on the balance sheet, the $350 million in equity after 2025, I guess, does that contemplate sort of increases beyond the current CapEx plan as you look to ramp up reliability and renewable spending?\nRejji Hayes: This just incorporates the current five year plan of $17 billion of utility CapEx. And it's enough work to prepare these five year plans. So we're not thinking about year six through 10, just yet. So I would say that it's, again, just the $17 billion utility CapEx plan and the funding associated there with. But as per my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased that even with that upward pressure on equity needs as a result of that growing capital plan, we didn't have to change the annual amount. So we're still up to $350 million as we were in our prior plan, and it has a lot to do with just good cash flow generation and the plan to monetize tax credits as a result of the IRA.\nShahriar Pourreza: Last one is just on the Palisades, revival seems to be moving forward with the DOE loans. Does that change sort of the calculus maybe from a resource planning perspective? Would you be open to purchasing the power under an FCM construct? Or does it still seem too expensive for you?\nGarrick Rochow: We're watching the activity on Palisades. But I just want to remind everybody on the call here, we're not involved in Palisades. And from a PPA perspective, it's spoken for, both with two coops. And so, we're not engaged at all within that process.  Now, we hope, from an implication perspective, we think it's great for Michigan, and we wish them well and success in getting the plan up and operational.\nShahriar Pourreza: So no change in your resource planning is, I guess, the point was.\nGarrick Rochow: No change in the resource planning. And I would just remind everybody, even with that potential out there, we see great opportunities in energy and capacity that are evident at Dearborn Industrial Generation.\nOperator: The next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.\nDavid Arcaro: Congratulations to both Sri and Jason. Really great working with both of you. I was curious if you could give your latest thoughts on load growth expectations here and whether you're seeing any increased activity in manufacturing or data center growth kind of hit the radar.\nGarrick Rochow: Let me start and then I'll pass it over to Rejji too. There's a lot of great things going on in Michigan from an economic development perspective. Onshore and friend-shoring, benefits of the CHIPS Act, IRA, we're seeing growth in polysilicon, we're seeing growth in semiconductors, we're seen growth in agricultural processing, battery manufacturing, and parts that go into vehicles and the like. So just a lot of manufacturing growth, which I love. Frankly, it creates jobs. It has a supply chain that goes with it. And frankly, there's a lot of margin in those areas.  To your point, we're also seeing some data center growth. That's part of the plan. But we get really excited with the manufacturing side just because of the other additional benefits that are associated with that.  So, that's kind of a big level picture. And that pipeline continues. We've got a nice pipeline of growth into the years. And I want to remind everybody, we're playing conservatively. And we're not counting any of that upward supply and sales type opportunities until we see the meter spinning. So that's just our conservative approach.  But let me hand it over to Rejji for some additional comments. \nRejji Hayes: David, I think Garrick summarized it pretty well. And the big takeaway here is we plan conservatively. But what I'm pleased to represent, just to add some numbers to Garrick's good comments is that, you think about the last several planning cycles we've had, we've suggested that we've had sort of flat to stable or slightly declining load growth. And it's always important to remember that our load growth math includes our energy efficiency actions where we're basically reducing load year-over-year by 2%.  And so, if you that into account, we've been up about 2% or thereabouts on a gross basis for many years. But this current plan, on a five-year basis, offers about a 1% swing from where we were just in our last five year plan. And so, we're assuming little over 0.5% of growth over this five year plan, again, inclusive of our energy efficiency efforts.  And so, even though Garrick highlighted that we have a pretty robust and diverse pipeline of opportunities, all we have embedded in our current five year plan are the two large projects that were announced over the last year or so with Goshen and Ford. And so, that's really all we have incorporated in our plan.  And I'll tell you, candidly, we'll be disappointed if that's all we're talking about in the next two to three years, given, again, the breadth and depth of our pipeline today. So good opportunities going forward on the load front. We're already seeing that in the numbers, but I think there's more opportunity going forward.\nDavid Arcaro: Back on the topic of rate cases, I was just wondering your latest thoughts on the ability to settle rate cases, not for the electric one, obviously, but maybe your gas rate case, and then more broadly going forward in the state for future rate case activity?\nGarrick Rochow: We have a historic practice, and we're coming off a four or five \u2013 I have lost track now \u2013 settlements. And so, that's still part of our makeup. We're still going to look at how to \u2013 when a case is underway, how we best reach the right conclusion for our customers and for our investors. And so, we look at those opportunities. I've been on these calls before and said, I look for any opportunity for settlement when the conditions are right. But we're also comfortable going forward because we're that confident on our ability to get a constructive outcome here in Michigan.  This gas case that we filed in December, fairly straightforward. I'm hopeful that we can reach a settlement. Again, if it doesn't, that's okay, too. We can get a constructive outcome here in Michigan.\nOperator: Next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research.\nMichael Sullivan: I know this got asked like a couple different ways, Rejji, but just on the equity needs, maybe if you could just frame how to think about where they could go as CapEx goes higher as we start to roll forward with the REP refresh, like taking into context the ability to use transferability, this cushion you got for Moody's, like CapEx goes up by x, how much could that potentially increase equity?\nRejji Hayes: I would say, clearly, we've made the working assumptions in this current five year plan quite clear, up to $350 million starting in 2025 through the duration of this plan out to 2028.  As it pertains to future five year plans, mathematically, I would say yes, if your capital plan increases, and I think based on what we've talked about with respect to the prospects in the New Energy Law, we will see upward pressure on our capital plan going forward. Remember, they are sources of offsetting pressure. Given the strength of the regulatory construct in Michigan, there's very strong operating cash flow generation, which obviously provides a source of internal equity. And then, we've got now sources of downward pressure with the ability to monetize tax credits. The amount we have embedded in our plan is just over $0.5 billion. And I expect that to accrete over time as we take on new renewable projects. And then, obviously, the good news from Moody's this morning, offers a little bit more headroom on the Moody's side. Now, I would not suggest at the moment that we're prepared to give sort of new equity needs on a hypothetical basis, but we'll recalibrate every year. But I think, again, the strong sources of downward pressure on equity needs will be operating cash flow generation, the ability to monetize credits, and obviously, Moody's decision today is helpful. And, obviously, we plan conservatively. So that's the other aspect of it as well.  And, obviously, with the great rate construct, in addition to the cash flow generation, we have a solid level of retained earnings, particularly with a very disciplined dividend policy that Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks. So that's the other aspect of that as well.\nMichael Sullivan: Just wanted to check in the latest on the [indiscernible] looking at, performance base rates in Michigan, and where that stands and where you potentially see that going.\nGarrick Rochow: The process is well underway, Michael, and it's improving. We've seen a move from a handful of metrics down to four metrics that are very benchmarkable across the industry. Our next set of comments are due by February 2.  And what we're leaning into in those comments is a better connection between these outcomes and reliability and more certainty on capital recovery. If you look at best practices for performance based rate making across the country, frankly across the globe, there's a greater tie between here's the outcome and here's the certainty on recovery. So we're wanting to make sure in our comments that that is true here in Michigan. And so, that's the work that's underway.  So we'll continue to follow the process. And I'm sure here, just given the constructive nature of Michigan, we can get to a place, a good landing spot for PBR.\nMichael Sullivan: And any sense of just timing on when it could all kind of come to a conclusion?\nGarrick Rochow: We're still in process right now. Like I said, comments are due here February 2. Ideally, here, there's some milestones around May timeframe as well, but we haven't got a clear picture on ending perspective.  The next electric rate case will be on this one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Maybe zeroing back to where we've been talking about the balance sheet here for a little bit. I just want to clarify what's in the updated CFO, the cash flow number that you projected? I presume that doesn't include any kind of expectations for uplift on DIG, among other factors. Also, maybe we could talk at the same time about how much additional latitude you're getting from Moody's, given the tweak with the juniors there.  And then, ultimately, on the dividend, it seems like dividend growth may be slowing a little bit. Should that be the new norm here just given maybe trying to target a lower payout given the accelerated growth? \nRejji Hayes: That's quite a bit to unpack there. So let me start with DIG and the OCF implications. And so, everything that we've highlighted in our five year plan, so think about the rate base growth up to 7.5%, we also talked about additional opportunities attributable to energy efficiency, these are the non-rate base growth drivers of the utility FCM, and then we talked about non-utility opportunities with DIG recontracting, all of that is incorporated into our earnings as well as our cash flow generation.  And so, we have a page in the appendix that shows about a little over $13 billion in aggregate cash flow generation over the course of this five year plan, and that incorporates some recontracting that we've seen at DIG on both the energy and capacity side, but it does not take into account that open margin that we have on slide 21 in the appendix and the potential opportunities if you see a higher capacity price over time. And so, there is some upside both from an earnings and cash flow perspective. So not all of that is baked into the cash flow. So there's additional opportunity there.  Just transitioning over to Moody's, I'll note that the decision to increase the equity credit from 25% to 50% for junior subordinated notes, that's worth about 50 to 60 basis points of FFO to debt accretion.  And then, with respect to dividend policy, we've really been very consistent in dividend policy since we sold EnerBank and started to accelerate the earnings growth of the business. And really, the idea has been to trend down to a low 60s percent payout ratio, as Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks.  And so, what that equates to is really decoupled growth between our DPS growth, our dividend per share growth and our earnings per share growth. We've said 6% to 8% toward the high end earnings per share. We'll probably be closer to the low end as the $0.11 increase today implies, and that'll be the plan going forward. Because we do believe that that's a very efficient use of capital to have the dividend policy in that level, so that we can efficiently fund the growth of the business. And so, really, that's how we're thinking about it going forward. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah, absolutely. Maybe just to tie that together here, if we look at your FFO metrics all together, you raised the rate base growth up to 7.5% now through the five-year period. I get it's not exactly apples to apples across the years, but it doesn't seem like there's incremental equity versus the original plan, per se. So, how do you think about your metrics through this outlook? Are you actually intact net-net-net, given the various factors we just elaborated on? Are you seeing a slight uptick prior to reflecting some of these other pieces, if you will? Just how do you think about where you land?\nRejji Hayes: We feel very good about the credit metrics thing in that mid-teens area, which we have targeted for some time now to preserve the solid investment grade credit rating we've had for many years now, and that's with a longstanding dialogue with the rating agencies.  The OCF generation, coupled with the equity needs, up to $350 million, as well as the monetization of tax credits, and again, just a very disciplined dividend policy, all of that allows us to maintain our credit metrics in that mid-teens area. And again, yes, we've increased the utility CapEx plan. We've held on to the equity needs, and those supporting factors allow us to stay in that level. And certainly, there may be opportunity longer term, but we feel very good about the metrics where they are today and don't intend to deviate from our current credit ratings. I don't think that's the implication in your question, but just wanted to say that for the avoidance of doubt.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Just through the plan outlook here, just given all the focus on legislation, can you just clarify what is the sort of expected bill impact or commitment here rather, given all to come on what that means for customers as best you guys are going to try to target this?\nGarrick Rochow: Julien, to be clear, this is with respect to the new energy legislation?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yeah. As you think about what is on the come, is there any kind of commitment you guys are making on trying to level that out for customers in any specific pace?\nGarrick Rochow: Needless to say, as we've always talked about when we prepare, not just this five year plan or prior plans, but future plan, the key governors will be affordability, balance sheet, and can we get the work done. And as it pertains to new energy legislation, yes, it does create additional opportunities, whether that's on the capital investment side or on contracts with the financial compensation mechanism. But, trust, we will not turn a blind eye to affordability.  And what makes us really excited about the opportunity going forward is when you think about our current energy mix and how we're sourcing energy, we have about $1.5 billion that we spend each year on a combination of PPAs as well as open market repurchases that we're paying a pretty high levelized cost of energy on a weighted average basis. And so, with the new energy law going into effect and the opportunities associated there with, we think there's a lot of headroom to get economics on energy going forward without increasing customer bills.  Now, there's a lot more process left, as Garrick noted, but we do think there's a lot of headroom already in bills for us to potentially deliver on that triple bottom line where there's nice economic opportunity for investors, but, again, not doing that to the detriment of customers.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank.\nAndrew Weisel: Two questions. Just to elaborate on your earlier comments, first, 2023 CapEx fell short of your target, $3.3 billion versus $3.7 billion planned. Can you just talk about what happened there? I think some of that might have been the solar delays. And then, what happened to that $400 million? It sounds like that was not part of the $1.5 billion increase. So can you just help explain what happened there?\nGarrick Rochow: It's expected in the context of a year that you're going to have projects. Andrew, I have 25 years in this business and no project goes exactly as you planned. And sometimes they shift and move. And particularly, with the solar piece, as Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks, it's really not the supply chain at this point. We've got a lock in on panels and the like. It is really about local entities and siting and permitting. Now we work through that. It just means we might move to a different community or there might be different setbacks that we have to work through. All that is doable, but it does create some shifts in the context of the year.  The key pieces, it's not moving. We still have to deliver on 2030 50% renewables, so you have to be at 60% by 2035. That doesn't change. And so, if it's not in this year, it just moves to a different year. And we'll continue that project. So there's a bit of shifting that ends up moving on the capital plan. So hopefully that helps.  Rejji's got a comment as well. \nRejji Hayes: Andrew, what I would add, I think you're sort of reflecting on Shahriar's question and my response to that, to be clear, we do have some of that spend that we did not achieve in 2023. Some of that is certainly pushed into this new five year plan. It's just the vast majority of the increase in this five year plan versus the prior is driven by reliability related investments. So there certainly is a portion of those deferrals being pushed into 2024 and beyond. But, again, the biggest driver of this new five year plan is reliability.\nAndrew Weisel: A quick follow up on that. In the page 24, you give spending by year. The number for 2028 at $3.1 billion is actually the lowest of the next five years. Directionally, I would have expected the opposite. I personally assume you'll be increasing that as you go through these regulatory processes. But maybe you can just talk about why the trend is dipping down rather than going up every year.\nRejji Hayes: Andrew, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So what you're seeing here in that 2024/2025 timeframe is just we do anticipate a pretty big increase in reliability-related investments. And so, that's what's driving a lot of that. Obviously, that's going to be subject to regulatory outcomes. And so, we'll toggle the plan as needed.  And I think Garrick's earlier point is well taken that, these plans, you see capital projects come in and out, some get pushed in, some get pushed out. And so, we do anticipate that smoothing out over time. And so, the composition over this five year timeframe may change, but we feel very good about the quantum overall of $17 billion. And so, you may see some of that lumpiness go in and out \u2013 sorry, smooth out over time.\nOperator: Next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. \nDurgesh Chopra: Rejji, can you quantify for us, of that $13 billion in operating cash flow, how much of that is tax credits monetization?\nRejji Hayes: It's about $0.5 billion of tax credit monetization that's incorporated, a little over $0.5 billion. And that really drives a good portion of the vintage over vintage difference. In the prior vintage, I think we were saying, call it, almost $12.5 billion of aggregate cash flow, operating cash flow generation. And this one, we're kind of 13 and change. So, a good portion that's driven by the tax credit monetization, which, again, is over $0.5 billion.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's like over the five year period, so $100 million a year, roughly speaking.\nRejji Hayes: I wouldn't say it's as linear as that. Or as flat as that. I would say it's going to be a little lower in the front end and then it's going to grow over time.\nDurgesh Chopra: And a quick follow-up. Any update on the storm review process? What's going on there? I know we're expecting a report out, I think in September this year, just any anything you could share there.\nGarrick Rochow: As I've shared in previous calls, Durgesh, we're working on proven reliability. You can see that in the capital investment plan. You can see that in the reliability roadmap. We're focused on and the Commission is focused on it, the audits underway, good process audit, and I look forward to the results and would anticipate we're going to incorporate in the future rate cases.  From a process perspective, still looks like we're on track for a September timeframe.\nOperator: The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. \nTravis Miller: Quick question on slide 12. The $0.16 of the cost savings, how much of that is just the reversal of higher costs and how much is incremental cost savings you're expecting this year?\nRejji Hayes: It's Rejji. On the waterfall chart, just for others, reference for 2024, yeah, the $0.16 of pickup that we're seeing \u2013 or that we're anticipating year-over-year, you do see a portion of reversal related to storm activity. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a significant ice storm in the first quarter of 2023. And so, we do not anticipate storms of that magnitude year in and year out.  But we also have a good portion of CE Way related savings. And I'd say it's about $60 million, or call it $0.15. And you have to think about the puts and takes here. So you've got the reversal of storms, you definitely have cost savings embedded in this current plan, but we also have inflation in other cost categories like salaries, as well as other costs, non-labor related costs. And so, there's a mix of inflation, as well as cost savings to offset or fund that inflation. And then that coupled with the reversal of the storm is what drives that $0.16 per share.\nTravis Miller: A broader question. You have touched on a little bit in the call here, but we think about those clean energy standard buckets in terms of the nuclear, natural gas with carbon capture and renewables, what's your thought long term, in general? I know you don't have those specifics yet. But how those three buckets work for you? It seems like in your earlier comments, nuclear is not really on the table right now. How much does nuclear, natural gas/CC go into that mix when you're thinking about 2035 or 2040?\nGarrick Rochow: What I love about this energy law is there is a lot of flexibility. There's just a ton of flexibility in there. And that's a strength. And that's served us well in previous energy laws. If you go back to 2016, Integrated Resource Plan, you build a plan that works for your customers, works for your investors and allows you to deliver the energy supply that you need across your service area.  Our focus right now is really on this first step, which is the Renewable Energy Plan. And that is wind, it's solar, it's hydros, we have to hit a milestone by 2030 of 50% and then by 2035 of 60%. Those are important milestones first. So that's our focus right now.  Now, we're not taking our eye off the ball. Like 2040, we have to have 100% clean energy. There's a milestone along that journey as well. That will get into the carbon capture, that will get into other considerations and how we meet that. So that's a broader definition where nuclear is part of it, natural gas with carbon capture.  I anticipate that, once we get this Renewable Energy Plan finalized, we're going to start looking out there at those other future sources. Right now, we would see it, given our natural gas fleet, as consideration for carbon capture as one of the options, but we're not taking anything off the table. You've got to have a wide open landscape, we've got to do right math, got to make sure we have the right plan for our customers and for our investors. So we're not saying no to anything. So hopefully that helps.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sophie Karp with KeyBanc.\nSophie Karp: I wanted to ask you about your prospective growth in renewable energy investments. So basically, as outlined by the new law and the filing you intend to make, I guess what we're seeing in other states and other jurisdictions right now is some sort of a push back maybe on those types of investments. And the genesis of that might be different in different jurisdictions, but it seems that the cost is often a barrier. So my question is, how do you plan to sort of avoid that? And what are the steps you've taken to socialize this plan as to not shock the regulators or intervenors or consumers [indiscernible] that becomes reality.\nGarrick Rochow: It's a great question. There's a lot of dynamics that play out in any type of construction, whether you're putting in a gas pipeline or whether you're building renewables. And we've really, at a ground level, from a community perspective, is where we see the opportunity to be able to best influence this.  For example, we completed the 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm up in the Gratiot County. Gratiot County and surrounding counties have been very welcoming to renewables. And so, we know that because we're on the ground making that happen. And that's the way we intend to approach these at a very local level.  Now there has been a siting reform in the state that was signed in November timeframe by our governor. That has to be implemented by the Commission. And so, there's some work there. But that could also help from a siting perspective, as we move forward. I would remind you too, within this New Energy Law, we have the opportunity to be outside of Michigan as well in MISO. And so, we're going to look for a lot of \u2013 there's windier states, there's sunnier states, we're going to look for those areas where projects are underway, or there's a good siting opportunity to be able to connect and be able to achieve the clean energy standard as well. As I shared also, when I think forward about this new energy standard, it's a mix, right? Not all ownership, it's not all PPAs, there's probably a blend that makes the most sense. And that's what we're figuring out right now. So that gives us a lot of options. Again, that's the strength of this to be able to find all those important resources, get them all sited and get them constructed.  I would also remind you, last comment, I'm a little long winded here. But there is flexibility in this law. If you're not there exactly in 2030 or 2035, you can get an exception through the Public Service Commission. So that also offers flexibility to be able to achieve these ambitious clean energy goals. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho.\nAnthony Crowdell: Just quickly, I wanted to take the other side of Julien's question. I think you've finished the year slightly under a 15% FFO to debt, potentially get 60 basis points added for the change at Moody's. Any thought? I think the upgrade trigger for you guys at Moody's is 17%. Any thought of maybe achieving that to get an upgrade to your credit rating?\nRejji Hayes: It's Rejji. I would just say it's a pretty big lift, I would think, to get mathematically to that 17% or high teens area that Moody's and S&P have guided us toward if we wanted to get an upgrade. And so, that would require in the absence of additional equity, pretty substantial cash flow generation and/or monetization of tax credits. And so, I don't foresee that in the near term or in this vintage of our five year plan.  And I've also just \u2013 observing markets now for what seems like the last 15 to 20 years. It really hasn't been worth the cost of getting to those higher credit rating levels. If you think about the juice being worth the squeeze, just the amount of coupon that you can save by having a higher credit rating has not been worth the cost of all the equity issuances and so on.  We like where we are right now. We think that's the most efficient area from a credit rating perspective, to issue debt. And really, there's no appetite to equitize the balance sheet in a manner that would allow us to get an upgrade. So we feel good where we are is a longwinded way of saying that.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Garrick for closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Emily. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today for year-end earnings call. I look forward to seeing you on the road here in the near future. Take care and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. As Garrick highlighted, we delivered strong financial performance in 2023, with adjusted net income of $907 million, which translates to $3.11 per share, toward the high end of our guidance range.  The key drivers of our 2023 financial performance included strong cost performance throughout the organization, fueled by CE Way, a solid beat at NorthStar and a variety of non-operational countermeasures, such as liability management and tax planning, which more than offset the significant weather-related headwinds experienced throughout the year.  And to further underscore the magnitude of cost performance delivered by our workforce, our fourth quarter operating and maintenance, or O&M, expense, exclusive of service restoration and vegetation management, was approximately 25% below the comparable period in 2022 and over 20% below our five year average for this cost category, a truly impressive achievement.  All in, we managed to offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, without compromising our operational commitments to our customers and the communities we serve.  At CMS, we've had plenty of years of adversity, followed by impressive operational and financial beat, but I can't recall one quite like 2023, a year in which our workforce personified grit and displayed that perennial will to deliver for all stakeholders.  To elaborate on the strength of our financial performance in 2023, on slide 10, you'll note that we've met or exceeded the vast majority of our key financial objectives for the year. From a financing perspective, we successfully settled $178 million of equity forward contracts in November and settled the remaining roughly $265 million in forwards in January. As a reminder, these forwards are pricing levels favorable to our planning assumption.  The only financial target missed in 2023 was related to our customer investment plan at the utility, which was budgeted for $3.7 billion. We ended the year below that, at $3.3 billion, primarily due to siting and permitting delays at select solar projects. As mentioned in the past, we fully intend to build out all of the solar projects approved in IRP and voluntary green pricing [indiscernible]. And with the Michigan Renewable Energy siting reform bill passed last fall, we should see better progress here going forward.  Moving to our 2024 EPS guidance on slide 11. We are raising our 2024 adjusted earnings guidance range to $3.29 to $3.35 per share from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, as Garrick noted, with continued confidence toward the high end of the range.  As you can see in the segment details, our EPS growth will primarily be driven by the utility, providing $3.74 to $3.80 of adjusted earnings, the details of which I'll cover on the next slide. At NorthStar, we're assuming EPS contribution of $0.16 to $0.18, which reflects strong underlying performance, primarily DIG, and ongoing contributions from our renewables business.  Lastly, our financing assumptions remain conservative at the parent segment and our 2024 guidance range assumes the absence of liability management transactions. As always, we'll remain opportunistic in this regard, and we'll look to capitalize on attractive market conditions, should they arise.  To elaborate on the glide path to achieve our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance range, you'll see the usual waterfall chart on slide 12. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are measured on a full-year basis and are relative to 2023.  From left to right, we'll plan for normal weather which in this case amounts to $0.43 per share of positive year-over-year variance, given the absence of the atypically mild temperatures experienced throughout 2023. Additionally, we anticipate $0.23 of EPS pickup, attributable rate relief, really driven by the residual benefits of last year's constructive gas rate case settlement and assumed supportive outcomes on our pending electric and gas rate cases. As always, our rate relief figures are stated net of investment-related costs, which is depreciation, property taxes and utility interest expense.  As we turn to our cost structure in 2024, you'll note $0.16 per share of positive variance due to continued productivity, driven by the CE Way, the ongoing benefits of cost reduction measures implemented in 2023, which was our voluntary separation plan which reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%, and initiatives already underway. It is also worth noting that our cost assumptions exclude the impact of the catastrophic ice storm we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.  Lastly, in the penultimate bar, on the right hand side, you'll notice significant negative variance, which largely consists of the reversal of select one-time cost reduction measures. These are partially offset by the ongoing benefits of our well executed financing plan in 2023, and we're assuming the usual conservative assumptions around whether normalized sales, taxes and non-utility performance, among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.58 to $0.64 per square of negative variance. As always, we'll adapt to changing conditions throughout the year to mitigate risks and deliver our operational and financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors.  On slide 13, we have a summary of our near and long-term financial objectives. To avoid being repetitive, I'll focus my remarks on those metrics we have not yet covered. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to target solid investment grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly, as we balance the needs of the business.  As previously mentioned, we have already settled the remaining equity forwards and have no additional equity needs in 2024. Longer term, we intend to resume our at the market or ATM equity issuance program in the amount of up to $350 million per year beginning in 2025 and extending through 2028, which is essentially the same assumption in our previous five year plan, but for the extension of an additional year. We're able to maintain our pre-existing equity needs despite an increase in utility capital plan, given the expectation of strong operating cash flow generation and the ability to monetize tax credits, courtesy of Inflation Reduction Act.  It is also worth noting that this morning's decision by Moody's to increase the equity credit ascribed to junior subordinated notes, which represents about 40% of our debt at the parent company, is not embedded in our plan, thus providing further cushion in these metrics.  Slide 14 offers more specificity on the balance of our funding needs in 2024, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility, over half of which has been opportunistically issued as noted on the page. And the coupon rate on this newly issued debt is favorable to plan, thus providing a helpful tailwind as we start the year.  Over the coming year, we have no planned long term financings at the parent and already redeemed at full maturity in January at par. Longer term, we have relatively modest near term maturities at the parent, with $250 million due in 2025 and $300 million due in 2026.  On slide 15, we've refreshed our sensitivity analysis on key variables for your modeling assumptions. As you'll note, with reasonable planning assumptions and our track record of risk mitigation, the probability of large variances from our plan is minimized.  Our model has served and will continue to serve all stakeholders well. Our customers receive safe, reliable and clean energy at affordable prices, our diverse and battle tested workforce remains committed to our purpose-driven organization, and our investors benefit from consistent industry-leading financial performance.  Before I hand it back to Garrick, I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to echo Garrick's praise of Sri, whom I've worked closely with over the past seven years. Sri's contributions to the finance team and the company have been immeasurable since he joined CMS. So thank you, Sri. You're leaving it better than you found it, and I look forward to working with you and Jason in your new roles.  And with that, I'll pass it on to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. All I would add to Garrick's good comments is, as you think about that trajectory and sequencing the Garrick laid out, it's important to note that the plan that we laid out today, that takes you from 2024 to 2028 does not incorporate any capital investment opportunities associated with the new legislation. And so, as we file the REP in the second half of this year and then get feedback presumably in the second half of 2025, we won't start incorporating capital opportunities, most likely for a couple of vintages of five year plans. Now, we have started to layer in the energy waste reduction or energy efficiency opportunities, as well as modest portion of the FCM opportunities. But I think in subsequent five year plans, you'll start to see more FCM-related opportunities and certainly more capital opportunities, but it's going to take a couple of vintages before we have real clarity on that. Is that helpful? Jeremy, this is Rejji. So, Moody's this morning increased the equity credit that they ascribe to junior subordinated notes, which are more informally referred to as hybrids. It was previously a 25% equity credit. And they're essentially now at parity with S&P at 50%.  The reason why that's impactful for us is that we've issued those securities quite a bit over the last five to six years, and so currently represents about 40% of our debt portfolio at the holdco. And so, by them, increasing the equity credit ascribed to this, it really increases, I'd say, the FFO to debt metrics at Moody's by that 50 to 60 basis points. So fairly accretive from a credit perspective to plan. I would say it's largely due to the latter and that's incremental CapEx. So, remember, we have the electrical liability roadmap that we provided \u2013 that we filed with the commission in late September of last year. And so, that had $3 billion of incremental CapEx opportunity versus the prior vintage. We haven't incorporated all of that. But about half is, as per Garrick's prepared remarks, so call it roughly a good portion of that $1.5 billion step up in our new plan versus our old plan.  We also do have increased renewable investments. But I wouldn't say that that's sort of the deferrals that are coming into 2024 from 2023. Yes, there's a little bit of that, but it's largely an additional IRP execution on the renewable side, as well as our voluntary green pricing program. So I'd say the vast majority of that uplift from our five year CapEx plan, the current one versus the prior, is driven by electrical liability related investments, and then you've got a portion attributable to clean energy investments, largely renewables. This just incorporates the current five year plan of $17 billion of utility CapEx. And it's enough work to prepare these five year plans. So we're not thinking about year six through 10, just yet. So I would say that it's, again, just the $17 billion utility CapEx plan and the funding associated there with. But as per my prepared remarks, we're quite pleased that even with that upward pressure on equity needs as a result of that growing capital plan, we didn't have to change the annual amount. So we're still up to $350 million as we were in our prior plan, and it has a lot to do with just good cash flow generation and the plan to monetize tax credits as a result of the IRA. David, I think Garrick summarized it pretty well. And the big takeaway here is we plan conservatively. But what I'm pleased to represent, just to add some numbers to Garrick's good comments is that, you think about the last several planning cycles we've had, we've suggested that we've had sort of flat to stable or slightly declining load growth. And it's always important to remember that our load growth math includes our energy efficiency actions where we're basically reducing load year-over-year by 2%.  And so, if you that into account, we've been up about 2% or thereabouts on a gross basis for many years. But this current plan, on a five-year basis, offers about a 1% swing from where we were just in our last five year plan. And so, we're assuming little over 0.5% of growth over this five year plan, again, inclusive of our energy efficiency efforts.  And so, even though Garrick highlighted that we have a pretty robust and diverse pipeline of opportunities, all we have embedded in our current five year plan are the two large projects that were announced over the last year or so with Goshen and Ford. And so, that's really all we have incorporated in our plan.  And I'll tell you, candidly, we'll be disappointed if that's all we're talking about in the next two to three years, given, again, the breadth and depth of our pipeline today. So good opportunities going forward on the load front. We're already seeing that in the numbers, but I think there's more opportunity going forward. I would say, clearly, we've made the working assumptions in this current five year plan quite clear, up to $350 million starting in 2025 through the duration of this plan out to 2028.  As it pertains to future five year plans, mathematically, I would say yes, if your capital plan increases, and I think based on what we've talked about with respect to the prospects in the New Energy Law, we will see upward pressure on our capital plan going forward. Remember, they are sources of offsetting pressure. Given the strength of the regulatory construct in Michigan, there's very strong operating cash flow generation, which obviously provides a source of internal equity. And then, we've got now sources of downward pressure with the ability to monetize tax credits. The amount we have embedded in our plan is just over $0.5 billion. And I expect that to accrete over time as we take on new renewable projects. And then, obviously, the good news from Moody's this morning, offers a little bit more headroom on the Moody's side. Now, I would not suggest at the moment that we're prepared to give sort of new equity needs on a hypothetical basis, but we'll recalibrate every year. But I think, again, the strong sources of downward pressure on equity needs will be operating cash flow generation, the ability to monetize credits, and obviously, Moody's decision today is helpful. And, obviously, we plan conservatively. So that's the other aspect of it as well.  And, obviously, with the great rate construct, in addition to the cash flow generation, we have a solid level of retained earnings, particularly with a very disciplined dividend policy that Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks. So that's the other aspect of that as well. That's quite a bit to unpack there. So let me start with DIG and the OCF implications. And so, everything that we've highlighted in our five year plan, so think about the rate base growth up to 7.5%, we also talked about additional opportunities attributable to energy efficiency, these are the non-rate base growth drivers of the utility FCM, and then we talked about non-utility opportunities with DIG recontracting, all of that is incorporated into our earnings as well as our cash flow generation.  And so, we have a page in the appendix that shows about a little over $13 billion in aggregate cash flow generation over the course of this five year plan, and that incorporates some recontracting that we've seen at DIG on both the energy and capacity side, but it does not take into account that open margin that we have on slide 21 in the appendix and the potential opportunities if you see a higher capacity price over time. And so, there is some upside both from an earnings and cash flow perspective. So not all of that is baked into the cash flow. So there's additional opportunity there.  Just transitioning over to Moody's, I'll note that the decision to increase the equity credit from 25% to 50% for junior subordinated notes, that's worth about 50 to 60 basis points of FFO to debt accretion.  And then, with respect to dividend policy, we've really been very consistent in dividend policy since we sold EnerBank and started to accelerate the earnings growth of the business. And really, the idea has been to trend down to a low 60s percent payout ratio, as Garrick highlighted in his prepared remarks.  And so, what that equates to is really decoupled growth between our DPS growth, our dividend per share growth and our earnings per share growth. We've said 6% to 8% toward the high end earnings per share. We'll probably be closer to the low end as the $0.11 increase today implies, and that'll be the plan going forward. Because we do believe that that's a very efficient use of capital to have the dividend policy in that level, so that we can efficiently fund the growth of the business. And so, really, that's how we're thinking about it going forward. We feel very good about the credit metrics thing in that mid-teens area, which we have targeted for some time now to preserve the solid investment grade credit rating we've had for many years now, and that's with a longstanding dialogue with the rating agencies.  The OCF generation, coupled with the equity needs, up to $350 million, as well as the monetization of tax credits, and again, just a very disciplined dividend policy, all of that allows us to maintain our credit metrics in that mid-teens area. And again, yes, we've increased the utility CapEx plan. We've held on to the equity needs, and those supporting factors allow us to stay in that level. And certainly, there may be opportunity longer term, but we feel very good about the metrics where they are today and don't intend to deviate from our current credit ratings. I don't think that's the implication in your question, but just wanted to say that for the avoidance of doubt. Andrew, what I would add, I think you're sort of reflecting on Shahriar's question and my response to that, to be clear, we do have some of that spend that we did not achieve in 2023. Some of that is certainly pushed into this new five year plan. It's just the vast majority of the increase in this five year plan versus the prior is driven by reliability related investments. So there certainly is a portion of those deferrals being pushed into 2024 and beyond. But, again, the biggest driver of this new five year plan is reliability. Andrew, this is Rejji. I'll take that. So what you're seeing here in that 2024/2025 timeframe is just we do anticipate a pretty big increase in reliability-related investments. And so, that's what's driving a lot of that. Obviously, that's going to be subject to regulatory outcomes. And so, we'll toggle the plan as needed.  And I think Garrick's earlier point is well taken that, these plans, you see capital projects come in and out, some get pushed in, some get pushed out. And so, we do anticipate that smoothing out over time. And so, the composition over this five year timeframe may change, but we feel very good about the quantum overall of $17 billion. And so, you may see some of that lumpiness go in and out \u2013 sorry, smooth out over time. It's about $0.5 billion of tax credit monetization that's incorporated, a little over $0.5 billion. And that really drives a good portion of the vintage over vintage difference. In the prior vintage, I think we were saying, call it, almost $12.5 billion of aggregate cash flow, operating cash flow generation. And this one, we're kind of 13 and change. So, a good portion that's driven by the tax credit monetization, which, again, is over $0.5 billion. I wouldn't say it's as linear as that. Or as flat as that. I would say it's going to be a little lower in the front end and then it's going to grow over time. It's Rejji. On the waterfall chart, just for others, reference for 2024, yeah, the $0.16 of pickup that we're seeing \u2013 or that we're anticipating year-over-year, you do see a portion of reversal related to storm activity. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we had a significant ice storm in the first quarter of 2023. And so, we do not anticipate storms of that magnitude year in and year out.  But we also have a good portion of CE Way related savings. And I'd say it's about $60 million, or call it $0.15. And you have to think about the puts and takes here. So you've got the reversal of storms, you definitely have cost savings embedded in this current plan, but we also have inflation in other cost categories like salaries, as well as other costs, non-labor related costs. And so, there's a mix of inflation, as well as cost savings to offset or fund that inflation. And then that coupled with the reversal of the storm is what drives that $0.16 per share. It's Rejji. I would just say it's a pretty big lift, I would think, to get mathematically to that 17% or high teens area that Moody's and S&P have guided us toward if we wanted to get an upgrade. And so, that would require in the absence of additional equity, pretty substantial cash flow generation and/or monetization of tax credits. And so, I don't foresee that in the near term or in this vintage of our five year plan.  And I've also just \u2013 observing markets now for what seems like the last 15 to 20 years. It really hasn't been worth the cost of getting to those higher credit rating levels. If you think about the juice being worth the squeeze, just the amount of coupon that you can save by having a higher credit rating has not been worth the cost of all the equity issuances and so on.  We like where we are right now. We think that's the most efficient area from a credit rating perspective, to issue debt. And really, there's no appetite to equitize the balance sheet in a manner that would allow us to get an upgrade. So we feel good where we are is a longwinded way of saying that."

            "content": "Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Before I get started, I want to thank Sri for his leadership in the finance area, and I look forward to his continued growth and impact as he takes on this important role in electric supply, where he'll lead critical filings like our renewable energy plan and integrated resource plan, which I will discuss later in this call.  We have a deep bench of talent at CMS Energy. And it is critically important that we develop our leaders in key areas of the business, continuing to strengthen the bench, build dexterity, and provide challenging growth opportunities. I know both Sri And Jason will make a big impact in their new roles. I've shared before on these calls, this isn't our first rodeo. The CMS team delivers now 21 years of exceptional performance. I am proud to share with you the highlights of the year. And I am proud of this team. You will see in the numbers and our operational highlight, 2023 was an incredible year. We met and faced challenges that tested our team and we rose to the occasion.  First, let's talk about the weather. The 2022/2023 winter was in that top 10 warmest on record. And then there was summer. When much of the world saw temperature warmer temperatures, our summer, influenced by El Nino conditions, was cooler than normal. And then, December 2023, the second warmest December on record. Add to that, record storm activity within our service territory. To say the least, it was a challenging year.  Despite severe storms and unfavorable weather, we delivered and offset nearly $300 million of weather-related financial headwinds, serving our customers with heat and light and keeping our financial commitments for our investors. This world class team comes together and we do what we say we will do year in and year out. No excuses, just results.  As I said earlier, I'm proud of the team at CMS Energy. There are a number of great things we delivered in the year, even more than are represented on slide 4. In the interest of time, I want to hit on just a few. I want to highlight the Freedom Award from the Secretary of Defense, and why this is so special. This is the highest recognition a company can receive for supporting their employees who serve in the Guard and Reserve. The nomination was submitted by one of our employees and demonstrates the commitment of our entire company. This is an important part of our culture, to support and care for our people. And to honor our coworkers who serve our customers and our country.  We continue our focus on leading the clean energy transformation. In 2023. we retire over 500 megawatts of coal, further reducing our carbon footprint. Alongside these retirements, we ensured resource adequacy with the acquisition of the 1.2 gigawatt Covert natural gas generating station and brought online our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm. This thoughtful transition ensures customer reliability as we move our portfolio from coal to clean.  I also want to give a shout out to our small, but important NorthStar Clean Energy team. They performed well in 2023, exceeding our expectations for the year, completing the Newport solar project and demonstrating strong operational performance at Dearborn industrial generation, DIG. Another solid year of execution at CMS Energy across the triple bottom line, delivering industry leading, sustainable premium growth.  In 2023, Michigan also passed new energy legislation, starting the course for cleaner energy in Michigan, while maintaining resource adequacy, customer affordability and strengthening our financial plan. This legislation speaks to the constructive Financial Plan.  This legislation speaks to the constructive nature of Michigan, provides more incentives to grow our clean energy portfolio, furthering investment opportunities with increased certainty of recovery.  Now, it's still early days. We're evaluating all aspects of the new law, including the strategic advantage of owning versus contract and supply, the increased incentive on PPAs and what makes the most sense for us and for our customers.  The law provides a lot of flexibility and options, which is important. You'll see this play out in a couple of upcoming filings. I want to draw your attention to the Renewable Energy Plan. This is not a new filing, but becomes a more important input in the Integrated Resource Plan. The Renewable Energy Plan will detail our plan to meet the 60% renewable portfolio standard by 2035.  As you might imagine, this work is underway. We plan to file in the second half of the year. Following our renewable energy plan filing, our next 20-year Integrated Resource Plan is due in 2027. Together, the Renewable Energy Plan and Integrated Resource Plan will align our supply resources to deliver cost competitive, cleaner, and reliable energy as we target net zero. They also provide important transparency and certainty as we advance the business forward with investments in renewables and clean energy.  Michigan Energy Law continues to support its strong regulatory environment and needed customer investments. While the recent legislation provides opportunities to file our updated Renewable Energy Plan, the regulatory calendar is fairly routine in 2024. Our electric rate case continues toward a constructive outcome. We've seen positive indicators with key stakeholder support for recovery of customer investments and important investment mechanisms, such as the IRM and our undergrounding pilot. We expect an order from the Commission on or before March 1.  We filed our gas rate case in mid-December, with an ask of $136 million with a 10.25% ROE and in a 51.5% equity ratio. The request lines with needed investments outlined in our 10-year natural gas delivery plan. We expect an order for the end of the year.  On slide 7, we've highlighted our new five-year, $17 billion utility customer investment plan, which supports approximately 7.5% rate base growth through 2028. You will note that about 40% of our customer investment opportunities support renewable generation, grid modernization and maintenance service replacements on our gases, which are critical as we lead the clean energy transformation. The plan also includes an increased investment in the electric distribution system to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers.  We also have growth drivers outside of traditional rate base. These include adders built into legislation for incentives on energy efficiency programs and the financial compensation mechanism we earn on PPA that I mentioned earlier.  We also expect incremental earnings provided by our non-utility business, NorthStar Clean Energy, as they see attractive pricing from capacity and energy sold at DIG.  It's important to note we have a long and robust runway of additional investment opportunities both within and beyond the five-year window. As an example, we've incorporated a little less than half of the incremental $3 billion of customer investments associated with our electric reliability roadmap. We've also not yet included the customer investments associated with the new energy law. These will be included in our renewable energy plan filing and will provide more opportunities for investment.  I feel good about our five-year utility investment plan. It is focused on our customers. It positions the business for continued success and delivers for all stakeholders.  With that, I'll conclude with the 2023 results and long term outlook before passing it over to Rejji, who will cover the financials in more detail.  2023, no excuses, not weather, not storms, just results. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $3.11 or the high end of our guidance range. I'm also pleased to share that we are raising our 2024 adjusted full-year EPS guidance $0.02 to $3.29 to $3.35 from $3.27 to $3.33 per share, compounding off of 2023 actual result. Let me repeat, compounding off of actuals. That is a differentiator in this sector.  We continue to expect to be toward the high end of our 2024 guidance range, which points to our confidence as we start the year.  Furthermore, the CMS Energy Board of Directors recently approved a dividend increase to $2.06 per share for 2024. Longer term, we continue to guide for the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7%, up to 8%. Our dividend policy remains unchanged. We continue to grow the dividend. You'll see that we are targeting a dividend payout ratio of about 60% over time.  Finally, we remain confident in our plan for 2024 and beyond, given our longstanding inability to manage the work and consistently deliver industry-leading growth.  With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. You all know this last slide very well by now. Over two decades, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. Given the challenges of 2023, I'm extremely proud of the team's effort. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business. It has withstood the test of time, and provides us confidence for a strong outlook in 2024 and beyond.  With that, Emily, please open the lines for Q&A. Those traditional, what I call, outside of base growth, so those growth drivers outside of traditional rate base \u2013 energy efficiency, financial compensation mechanism and DIG \u2013 those are powerful in the plan.  And you asked specifically about Dearborn Industrial Generation. We are seeing both energy and capacity of prices elevated, particularly in the out years of the plan. We have available capacity beyond 2026 out through the plan. We're layering in contracts, really as we speak, which with attractive numbers and which gives us confidence in our plan, particularly in the out-years through DIG. First of all, this is not a new filing. It is a more important filing. It is a bigger filing. As you might imagine, if you're going to achieve 60% renewable by 2035 or 50% by 2030, it has to grow from a size perspective. So it takes on increased importance.  It's also important to remember it's based on energy versus the Integrated Resource Plan, which is based on capacity. So that work is underway. And it's really a spectrum. To meet that standard, do you do all PPAs? That's one bookend. Or do you do all ownership?  I view it somewhere in the middle. But what's the strength of this energy law is there's a lot of flexibility to be able to start that path to those clean energy ambitions. We've got to think about what the customer impact is. We're still required as a load serving entity to meet resource capacity constraints in the IRP. So that's a consideration. We've got to look at the balance sheet. And here's a really capital light option where we can get an FCM at 9%. That's a really attractive part of this energy law. So there's a lot of dynamics that have to play out in there. That work is underway right now.  We will file that Renewable Energy Plan in the second half of the year. We have until 2025 to get it done, but we want to pull that forward into 2024, given the work that has to be done and these milestones that are out there.  So we'll file that. The commission has and staff has 10 months to get to a final order. And then that information there will certainly aid our capital plan and the upside from an FCM mechanism, but also flows into our Integrated Resource Plan. And that Integrated Resource Plan should become less complex because of this Renewable Energy Plan work.  Ultimately, that then flows into rate cases as we move forward over time on the annual frequency.  So, I know Rejji has some more comments on this as well. So, I'll pass it to Rejji. Jeremy, things are progressing nicely. I feel good about a constructive outcome. Staff had a great starting spot on what I think can be a constructive outcome and feel confident that we can get there. There's a lot of positive indicators. Support for the important work on reliability. I would say there's a great alignment between staff and, frankly, the commissioners on where we want to go, improve reliability in the state. That's a big part of this electric rate case. And also, positive indicators on the mechanisms that we've talked about in the past, this infrastructure recovery mechanism. We think that's really important from a go forward reliability perspective. It also lines up with [indiscernible] have shared about ring fencing and providing opportunity to capital to see the insight of where those investments are and how they make a difference. And then, finally, our undergrounding pilot. That's seeing support as well. That's an important first step in this resiliency play and our larger ambitions that are evident in our reliability roadmap.  So, again, I feel really good about where the case is headed. And we expect the final order on or before March 1. Let me just reinforce that. And the way I would like to think about, add on to Rejji's good comments there, is that clean energy piece in the supply, it's what's approved in our 2022 IRP. And the upside will be to the tail end because we haven't built in any of this new energy law, as Rejji stated in some earlier comments. So, as that renewable energy plan is filed and eventually approved, then you'll see that it will slightly hit the tail, but even beyond the five years, you can see a nice path of 10 years of investment opportunity as a result of this energy law. We're watching the activity on Palisades. But I just want to remind everybody on the call here, we're not involved in Palisades. And from a PPA perspective, it's spoken for, both with two coops. And so, we're not engaged at all within that process.  Now, we hope, from an implication perspective, we think it's great for Michigan, and we wish them well and success in getting the plan up and operational. No change in the resource planning. And I would just remind everybody, even with that potential out there, we see great opportunities in energy and capacity that are evident at Dearborn Industrial Generation. Let me start and then I'll pass it over to Rejji too. There's a lot of great things going on in Michigan from an economic development perspective. Onshore and friend-shoring, benefits of the CHIPS Act, IRA, we're seeing growth in polysilicon, we're seeing growth in semiconductors, we're seen growth in agricultural processing, battery manufacturing, and parts that go into vehicles and the like. So just a lot of manufacturing growth, which I love. Frankly, it creates jobs. It has a supply chain that goes with it. And frankly, there's a lot of margin in those areas.  To your point, we're also seeing some data center growth. That's part of the plan. But we get really excited with the manufacturing side just because of the other additional benefits that are associated with that.  So, that's kind of a big level picture. And that pipeline continues. We've got a nice pipeline of growth into the years. And I want to remind everybody, we're playing conservatively. And we're not counting any of that upward supply and sales type opportunities until we see the meter spinning. So that's just our conservative approach.  But let me hand it over to Rejji for some additional comments. We have a historic practice, and we're coming off a four or five \u2013 I have lost track now \u2013 settlements. And so, that's still part of our makeup. We're still going to look at how to \u2013 when a case is underway, how we best reach the right conclusion for our customers and for our investors. And so, we look at those opportunities. I've been on these calls before and said, I look for any opportunity for settlement when the conditions are right. But we're also comfortable going forward because we're that confident on our ability to get a constructive outcome here in Michigan.  This gas case that we filed in December, fairly straightforward. I'm hopeful that we can reach a settlement. Again, if it doesn't, that's okay, too. We can get a constructive outcome here in Michigan. The process is well underway, Michael, and it's improving. We've seen a move from a handful of metrics down to four metrics that are very benchmarkable across the industry. Our next set of comments are due by February 2.  And what we're leaning into in those comments is a better connection between these outcomes and reliability and more certainty on capital recovery. If you look at best practices for performance based rate making across the country, frankly across the globe, there's a greater tie between here's the outcome and here's the certainty on recovery. So we're wanting to make sure in our comments that that is true here in Michigan. And so, that's the work that's underway.  So we'll continue to follow the process. And I'm sure here, just given the constructive nature of Michigan, we can get to a place, a good landing spot for PBR. We're still in process right now. Like I said, comments are due here February 2. Ideally, here, there's some milestones around May timeframe as well, but we haven't got a clear picture on ending perspective.  The next electric rate case will be on this one. Julien, to be clear, this is with respect to the new energy legislation? Needless to say, as we've always talked about when we prepare, not just this five year plan or prior plans, but future plan, the key governors will be affordability, balance sheet, and can we get the work done. And as it pertains to new energy legislation, yes, it does create additional opportunities, whether that's on the capital investment side or on contracts with the financial compensation mechanism. But, trust, we will not turn a blind eye to affordability.  And what makes us really excited about the opportunity going forward is when you think about our current energy mix and how we're sourcing energy, we have about $1.5 billion that we spend each year on a combination of PPAs as well as open market repurchases that we're paying a pretty high levelized cost of energy on a weighted average basis. And so, with the new energy law going into effect and the opportunities associated there with, we think there's a lot of headroom to get economics on energy going forward without increasing customer bills.  Now, there's a lot more process left, as Garrick noted, but we do think there's a lot of headroom already in bills for us to potentially deliver on that triple bottom line where there's nice economic opportunity for investors, but, again, not doing that to the detriment of customers. It's expected in the context of a year that you're going to have projects. Andrew, I have 25 years in this business and no project goes exactly as you planned. And sometimes they shift and move. And particularly, with the solar piece, as Rejji mentioned in his prepared remarks, it's really not the supply chain at this point. We've got a lock in on panels and the like. It is really about local entities and siting and permitting. Now we work through that. It just means we might move to a different community or there might be different setbacks that we have to work through. All that is doable, but it does create some shifts in the context of the year.  The key pieces, it's not moving. We still have to deliver on 2030 50% renewables, so you have to be at 60% by 2035. That doesn't change. And so, if it's not in this year, it just moves to a different year. And we'll continue that project. So there's a bit of shifting that ends up moving on the capital plan. So hopefully that helps.  Rejji's got a comment as well. As I've shared in previous calls, Durgesh, we're working on proven reliability. You can see that in the capital investment plan. You can see that in the reliability roadmap. We're focused on and the Commission is focused on it, the audits underway, good process audit, and I look forward to the results and would anticipate we're going to incorporate in the future rate cases.  From a process perspective, still looks like we're on track for a September timeframe. What I love about this energy law is there is a lot of flexibility. There's just a ton of flexibility in there. And that's a strength. And that's served us well in previous energy laws. If you go back to 2016, Integrated Resource Plan, you build a plan that works for your customers, works for your investors and allows you to deliver the energy supply that you need across your service area.  Our focus right now is really on this first step, which is the Renewable Energy Plan. And that is wind, it's solar, it's hydros, we have to hit a milestone by 2030 of 50% and then by 2035 of 60%. Those are important milestones first. So that's our focus right now.  Now, we're not taking our eye off the ball. Like 2040, we have to have 100% clean energy. There's a milestone along that journey as well. That will get into the carbon capture, that will get into other considerations and how we meet that. So that's a broader definition where nuclear is part of it, natural gas with carbon capture.  I anticipate that, once we get this Renewable Energy Plan finalized, we're going to start looking out there at those other future sources. Right now, we would see it, given our natural gas fleet, as consideration for carbon capture as one of the options, but we're not taking anything off the table. You've got to have a wide open landscape, we've got to do right math, got to make sure we have the right plan for our customers and for our investors. So we're not saying no to anything. So hopefully that helps. It's a great question. There's a lot of dynamics that play out in any type of construction, whether you're putting in a gas pipeline or whether you're building renewables. And we've really, at a ground level, from a community perspective, is where we see the opportunity to be able to best influence this.  For example, we completed the 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm up in the Gratiot County. Gratiot County and surrounding counties have been very welcoming to renewables. And so, we know that because we're on the ground making that happen. And that's the way we intend to approach these at a very local level.  Now there has been a siting reform in the state that was signed in November timeframe by our governor. That has to be implemented by the Commission. And so, there's some work there. But that could also help from a siting perspective, as we move forward. I would remind you too, within this New Energy Law, we have the opportunity to be outside of Michigan as well in MISO. And so, we're going to look for a lot of \u2013 there's windier states, there's sunnier states, we're going to look for those areas where projects are underway, or there's a good siting opportunity to be able to connect and be able to achieve the clean energy standard as well. As I shared also, when I think forward about this new energy standard, it's a mix, right? Not all ownership, it's not all PPAs, there's probably a blend that makes the most sense. And that's what we're figuring out right now. So that gives us a lot of options. Again, that's the strength of this to be able to find all those important resources, get them all sited and get them constructed.  I would also remind you, last comment, I'm a little long winded here. But there is flexibility in this law. If you're not there exactly in 2030 or 2035, you can get an exception through the Public Service Commission. So that also offers flexibility to be able to achieve these ambitious clean energy goals. Thank you, Emily. And I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today for year-end earnings call. I look forward to seeing you on the road here in the near future. Take care and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 P.M. Eastern Time running through November 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. What sets us apart in this industry is clear and it's been proven for over two decades are simple cleaner and leaner investment thesis. We've talked about this in many calls in many investor meetings and it works a long and robust capital runway, a best-in-class ability to take cost out of the business, to create headroom for needed investments and keep bills affordable for customers. Couple that with a constructive top-tier regulatory environment and that is our recipe for premium total shareholder return. Today I want to highlight one part of our investment thesis, infrastructure renewal. It starts with our five-year $15.5 billion capital plan which supports a long runway for important customer investments. This allows us to do what is most important for our customers deliver safe, reliable, affordable energy and lead the industry in the clean energy transformation. We are one of the first vertically integrated utilities to switch from coal to clean by 2025 leading the industry with net zero carbon by 2040 aligned with customers, policymakers and our strategic plan positioning us for the future. In our gas business, we are on pace to net zero methane by 2030 and with a 20% reduction in Scope 3 emissions one of the few in the industry making the gas system safer and cleaner. And in our electric distribution system, we are hardening the grid to make it more reliable today while preparing for the resiliency that will be required for EVs, connected devices and to mitigate impact of climate change. Our electric distribution system is vast covering much of the lower Peninsula of Michigan, but it's aging. We are seeing more frequent and severe weather which proves the future or require something different because our customers count on us for reliable service. Last month we filed our electric reliability road map with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which outlined our plan to improve reliability and prepare the system for greater resiliency. Over the last 20 years, we've seen an increase in both the frequency of storms and higher wind speed with some of the most extreme wins within the last four years. We're clearly seeing the effects of climate change. Given this in the increasing dependency on the electric distribution system, we have set forward a plan that bolsters the system now and builds for the future. We worked with the leading industry research institute EPRI benchmarking companies as well as advancing technology to build a robust and comprehensive plan. This five-year electric reliability road map calls for $7 billion of capital investment to harden the system, expand undergrounding, update infrastructure, increase capacity and advanced automation. To give you a small snapshot, our plan includes roughly 1,000 miles of system undergrounding in the near-term and longer term significantly more undergrounding to ensure our system is prepared to withstand severe weather. Originally our design standard was for 40-mile per hour wind. With the wind speeds we are seeing today, our new standard is for 80-mile per hour wind and 0.5 inch of ice loading. This plan also includes further automation in machine modeling adding technology to more precisely locate and isolate damage, reroute power and better predict problem areas keeping more customers online in responding to outages faster. We put our stake in the ground. We've identified the steps to improve reliability a step change and build an electric grid that can better withstand extreme weather and better serve our customers in the future. With commission support this plan will reduce the frequency and duration of outages while moving us into second quartile for reliability coupled with additional customer investments the longer-term vision delivers a grid or no outage will affect more than 100,000 customers and no customer will be without power for more than 24 hours. We expect these investments to be part of our upcoming electric rate case filings and will be implemented upon commission approval. And let me be clear, we are already making progress. We've doubled our investment in vegetation management over the last three years shortening our trim cycles. We've seen greater than 60% benefit where we've done the work. We've increased the amount of customer investments and upgrades using in hardening installing nearly 15,000 used devices in the last two years more than we've ever done reducing the number of customers impacted for interruption. We've increased our maintenance inspection frequency mining potential failures before they occur. And just last week we were notified that of the nearly 300 companies who applied for grants on the Department of Energy, we were one of seven companies who were awarded $100 million for specializing and improving circuit in disadvantaged communities. This is great for our company and our customers. First it accelerates investment, which were already part of our $7 billion electric reliability road map; second this strikes the important balance of reliability improvement and affordability; and finally because these are matching grant that provides greater line of sight and certainty recovery of these needed customer investments. We take our commitment to serve seriously what our customers deserve. We wake up every day to deliver. That's why we constructed our electric reliability road map. On Slide 5 I want to take a moment to provide an update on our regulatory calendar. In September, we revised our position in our electric rate case to $169 million and maintained our position for a 10.25% ROE and a 51.5% equity ratio. We're requesting approval of a 10-mile undergrounding pilot with plans to underground over 400 miles annually beginning in 2027, which aligns with our electric reliability road map, a small but important step in building out a program that can be supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission and will deliver significant improvement for our customers. We also requested a recovery mechanism for investments in our electric distribution system to improve reliability. Similar to the mechanism we've utilized in our gas business, which creates greater clarity on the investment end customer benefit while improving certainty of recovery. We expect the final order by March of next year. We also recently received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission on our gas rate case settlement providing continued value for our customers and investors. These rates became effective October 1. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. This case brings a continued focus on a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system will support needed customer investment. As we've shared in previous calls and in investor meetings, we continue to see the Michigan regulatory jurisdiction as constructive in providing a good balance for all stakeholders leading up to its ranking as top tier. Moving on to the financials. For the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 and $2.06 per share year-to-date. Rejji will provide additional details but despite a significant storm in the third quarter, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share and expect to deliver toward the high end. Given that confidence, we are initiating our full year guidance for 2024 at $3.27 to $3.33 per share reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range and we are well positioned just like 2023 to be toward the high end of that range. It is also important to remember that we always rebased guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call impounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Like we've done in previous years we'll provide you with an update on our 2024 guidance based off of actuals, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver the year and in our longer-term outlook providing exceptional value for all stakeholders. With that I'll hand it over to Rejji to offer some additional details.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a solid third quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share, driven by numerous cost reduction initiatives which have largely offset the headwinds that we have faced throughout the year most recently in the form of a severe storm that hit our electric service territory in August. To put the weather we have experienced in 2023 into perspective, we are approaching a record level of storm activity this year, which further supports the needed investments in our electric system that Garrick highlighted, and we have seen heating and cooling degree days of 11% and 24% below historical levels respectively on a year-to-date basis. That said, we do not make excuses and have implemented numerous countermeasures throughout the year to mitigate these risks and are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives this year, the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year and on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $2.06 per share given our progress in the aforementioned countermeasures which I'll elaborate on shortly. In the waterfall chart on Slide 7, for clarification purposes all of the variance analysis therein are measured relative to the comparable periods in 2022. The actuals are quantified on a year-to-date basis and the prospective period reflects the final three months of the year. Starting with actuals with respect to weather. The previously noted unfavorable weather experience in 2023 has driven $0.49 per share of negative go. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.20 per share of positive variance, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance through the third quarter has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses to the tune of $0.21 per share of negative variance due to higher service restoration expenses attributable to storms. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses exclusive of service restoration expense are down roughly 10% versus the third quarter of 2022, which highlights the significant cost performance we've realized across the business. To that end and as previously noted, we implemented numerous cost reduction initiatives early in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT projects and eliminating other discretionary spending. We have also supplemented these efforts with a voluntary separation program or VSP that reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%. And more importantly, as we leverage the CE Way our lean operating system, we will continue to eliminate waste and increase productivity going forward. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note that $0.27 per share of positive variance highlighted the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. We've seen this bar increase throughout the year, as a result of our continued success in realizing cost savings through financing efficiencies, liability management, strong tax planning and favorable non-weather sales in our electric business during the summer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, as always we plan for normal weather, which we expect will have a neutral impact on our financial performance versus the fourth quarter of 2022. And we expect a similar financial impact for rate relief net of investment-related costs as the benefits of our recent gas rate case settlement and our 2022 electric rate case settlement are largely offset by the absence tax benefits associated with the prior gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective as noted during our Q2 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the ongoing benefit cost reduction initiatives, which equates to $0.17 per share of targeted variance. It is also worth noting that the Q4 2022 comp for this bucket is notably soft given the higher-than-average O&M expenses incurred during that period. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, you'll note in the penultimate that yellow bar on the right that we're anticipating $0.23 to $0.29 per share a positive variance. As we've discussed previously, the key drivers here are the absence of significant discretionary actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to last year's electric rate case settlement and the filing of our voluntary refund mechanism which collectively equate to $0.12 per share. The remaining notable items that we anticipate in this bucket are from North Star our non-utility business achieving its full year guidance and favorable non-weather sales at the utility, which have trended well over the past few quarters. All in, we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year. And as always we'll take none of this positive momentum for granted and will approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia by maintaining our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you have come to expect. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings. Our financing strategy and strong balance sheet position us well given the market volatility we've seen recently. At the utility, our annual rate case cadence and the use of forward-looking test years allow us to incorporate higher interest rates into our filings and recover the associated costs with minimal lag. At the parent where funding costs are non-recoverable, we have limited refinancing risk in the near term with $250 million due in 2024 and 2025 and $300 million coming due in 2026. And as noted during our second quarter call, the 2024 maturity has already been prefunded with proceeds from our convertible debt issuance in May. It is also worth noting that 100% of the debt of the parent companies fixed is over 40% is hybrid in nature thus receiving equity credit from the rating agencies. In addition to strong liability management, we have continued to plan conservatively. And debt funding costs have increased in the current environment they remain consistent with the assumptions embedded in our long-term financial plan. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings for the benefit of our customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023. In short, I'm pleased to report that our financing plan for the year is largely completed. In fact at the utility, we've completed all of our planned first mortgage bond issuances for the year at a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.8%, which is below our planned estimate. The only remaining opco financing is a securitization funding to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base in our recently retired coal facilities. As for the parent company given the timing of the aforementioned convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards at price last year. So the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled in the fourth quarter. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of customers and investments. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks and for the Q&A session. \nGarrick Rochow : Thank you Rejji. You hear us say it every year. We deliver. Our track record spans two decades of consistently delivering industry-leading results in all conditions for all stakeholders. This year be no different. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thanks very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy, your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Good morning.\nGarrick Rochow : Hey, Jeremy, how are you? Good morning.\nJeremy Tonet: Good. Good. Thanks. Just wanted to start with the electric rate case if I could here. Thank you for the color that you provided but I wonder if we could dig in a little bit more on how recent conversations have been tracking in the case. Could you walk us through the core differences between DAS recommendation and your proposal? What items should we be looking for more specifically is that impossible when tracking mechanisms are disputed? And is a fully litigated case preferable in this area so there's no kind of gray areas?\nGarrick Rochow : Great question, Jeremy. I feel good about the progress of our electric rate case. And just to give you a little flavor on where we're at with that. In rebuttal we came back at $169 million. And as I shared in my prepared remarks 10.25% ROE and 51.5% equity ratio. And that reflects just the differences in the business from when we built the case to where we're at now in the forward-looking test year. Staff is at $88 million. And so the gap is pretty small between our ask and where the staff is which again I see is very constructive. And so we're really at a constructive starting point in the conversation. And much of that delta is made up with -- it's just really the cost of capital ROE and equity ratio. That's a big piece of the difference. And there's a few other what I call cats and dogs, important cash is the dog nonetheless but things that we are helpful for our customers. And so that's the big difference. Now let's talk a little bit about settlement in the context of settlement. And I've certainly been in a number of these calls where I'm open to settlement and settlement presents itself that's great. And we're certainly receptive to that. But as you pointed out there is an important mechanism in there and there's undergrounding. Those are two key things that we need to see come out of this case. Investment recovery mechanism to have some certainty on our distribution, let distribution investments in this underground pilot. This is important to get started, and there's a real benefit for our customers. And so those are harder to get in settlement just to be fully transparent. Typically, they're a black box when you go through settlement. And so we're prepared to go to the full distance. And I'll just be honest with the entire call it's likely we're going to go the full distance and I have confidence that we can get a really constructive outcome going to a full order.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful there. And maybe pivoting a bit could you walk us through your longer-term expectations for DIG particularly as it relates to recontracting here? Could you speak to the longer-term potential for this business and for non-regulated renewables growth in the future as well given the changing landscape?\nGarrick Rochow : Yes. Our non-utility growth continues to be small in the bigger scheme of things. Our primary business continues to be the utility space. So it's about a 95,5 [ph] mix. And as shared in the prepared remarks we expect them to be within guidance range. And so that's a good piece. It continues to be contracted renewables. And again Rejji uses these words singles and doubles. We're not swinging for the fences here. So just thoughtful contracted renewables. They have a utility-like return, long-term contracts assuming no terminal value again really conservative almost utility-like. And then there's the Dearborn Industrial Generation or DIG. And we continue to see upward pressure on energy and capacity prices. And so we're fully contracted out to 2025, with energy and capacity. And so we're filling in 2026 2027 in the out years. We plan conservatively, but those bilaterals and the contracts that we are inking are certainly better than expectations. Now don't read into that a sugar high. You've heard me say no sugar highs in the past. So you can anticipate 6% to 8% growth, on this again expectation toward the high side of that growth. And so we'll continue to reinvest as needed versus the sugar high. So hopefully, that's helpful as we see North Star\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Understood. No sugar highs, but certainly helpful towards the upper end of the range there. So thank you for the color, will leave it there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Julien, your line is open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey good morning, team. How you guys doings.\nGarrick Rochow: Hey, Julien.\nRejji Hayes: Good morning. Julien Congratulations on the announcement there and good work on your team. \nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: I appreciate it. Look just following up on the -- speaking of good work the distribution plan right the $7 billion that you guys talked about there. Can you elaborate just if you think that that's really kind of incremental versus your prior plan? It seems like that's probably kind of a net $1 billion increase over five years. Can you talk about is that incremental, or as you talk about sugar highs is that going to like offset capital elsewhere, if you will to smooth things out? Just curious on how you think about that fitting into the grander plan as you update that more holistically?\nGarrick Rochow: I'm really excited about this plan. We've talked about -- we've seen the storms this year and certainly we have an opportunity to improve reliability, in the here and now and then prepare for the an aging system a system that's seen higher wins and more severe weather and preparing for the future. So, the team has really done a nice job of putting a good plan together. Now when I look at the five years, it's more than an incremental $1 billion. It's an incremental $3 billion, right? What's right in the plan right now is $4 billion, in our five-year plan. Now I want to be really careful and really clear about this. And so when we get to the Q4 call, we're going to grow our capital. You can expect we're going to grow our capital. You can expect with these needs on the distribution system that it's going to be biased or it's going to be more growth in the on the electric distribution system. So that $4 billion number should grow. That's what I would anticipate and expect. However, I wouldn't just do the simple math of taking 15.5 and adding $3 billion to it. And that would get you the wrong answer to the wrong number. It's important that we get commission support. And as we go through the steps, we'll get that in the rate case filing and we'll weave that in to that capital plan over time. But it should give you a picture of the strength of our five-year plan. It is robust. There's plenty of opportunities out there and that extends even beyond 10 years into a really nice long capital runway. Its helpful Julien.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Absolutely. Thank you for giving all the context there. In fact speaking of context capacity markets writ large have attracted a decent amount of tension of late and certainly some of the inflationary dynamics around them. Can you speak a little bit to the status of DIG both your contracting status through the long term and more importantly, how you think about your commercial strategy here with pricing as elevated as it seems to be getting in some of these markets. So just curious, on what you guys are seeing and what the opportunity is and how that fits into the plan.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. And similar to my previous answer here on this that Dearborn Industrial generation we take a very conservative utility-like approach. And as you know over time we've just stacked in contracts for energy and capacity bilateral contracts to make sure that we are avoiding risk and market volatility. But we certainly, see some upward pressure on both energy and capacity prices as you noted. And so much of the energy and capacity is already -- contracts are already in place through 2025. but we're filling in the gaps at 2026 2027 and out years. We plan conservatively and those contracts are I would say, exceeding our expectations or exceeding our plan, which is great. And so we'll continue to operate just as we have historically in a really conservative mode and a conservative plan, but you can see we're layering in the future right now and feel good about the opportunities for growth at DIG.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. And then just quickly if you don't mind, the status of the solar projects just where that stands and the schedule for bringing those into rates. Sorry, just to clarify that. I just wanted to hit that as a last quick one.\nGarrick Rochow: We feel good about our renewable build. And in this electric rate case, we pulled out some of the renewable build. But I'll be honest with you, 25 years in this business been in engineering operations much of my career. There's projects and contracts that move between years. That's not a big deal. And much of our build this year is in wind. We're going to be COD here end of the year at our Heartland wind farm. We're building another 201 megawatts of wind. And so there's a lot of renewable build that's underway in these years. And so those projects that were referenced in the electric rate case were some of the ones that early got caught up in some of the ops and solar complaint-related issues. We've talked about that that's been hashed through in this industry. I felt good about the projects we have in mid-development right now. We have line of sight into panels. We got good sighting pieces. And so that will play out as part of our IRP build. The other thing is, these all projects don't go away. Remember that, these are part of the IRP. And so they'll get constructed here. It's just a matter of timing and that timing is being refined here. And I think at least one of them is going to go this year anyway so we're going to see some construction there. And remember, because they're approved in the IRP they get AFUDC along the way. So there's no earnings impact. Make sense?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good luck, guys. Thank you so much.\nGarrick Rochow: Yeah. Thanks, Julien.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim. Shahriar, your line is now open.\nShahriar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. As we reflect on your kind of prior guidance for $350 million of equity starting in 2025 does kind of that increased CapEx plan move your equity needs proportionately higher.\nRejji Hayes: Shar this is Rejji. Yeah, so we're still in the relatively early stage of building out -- sorry Shar? Shar, this is Rejji if you can hear me. So we're in the early stages of rolling out our five-year plan. So we're still calibrating where -- what the financing needs will be. As I've said before, the estimate that we have in our current five-year plan, where we said up to $350 million a year of equity starting in 2025. I don't see that number materially changing. Now, as the CapEx plan increases again we always recalibrate you may see a slight shift upward but we -- we have to take a look at all of the puts and takes the capital investments the cash flow generation. And I think at the end of the day you're not going to see us with any sort of need to do block equity. I still think even without seeing the numbers we'll be able to double out the equity in those outer years. But again, still early days on those calculations.\nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just from a stakeholder perspective where is the MPSC going with sort of the investigations into storms at this point? And I guess, what's the range of outcomes you guys anticipate and we've seen some comments filed but there seems to be a negatively skewed mechanism for penalties versus rewards\nGarrick Rochow: So there's two pieces. And I wouldn't put a negative take on it. All the conversations we have with staff and commissioners continue to be constructive and frankly we're both aligned in the same thing. We want to improve reliability. We have a longer-term view of resiliency. And when we're aligned it makes for constructive conversations. But there's two pieces that I'm hearing in your question Shar. There's one there's the audit that's underway. That was started in September. Liberty Consulting Group is the one doing the work. They've participated with other utilities very skilled organization. Right now they're in the data collection phase that's well underway. We expect an interim report about the end of the year and then a full report likely in the September-ish time frame. It's not about a year report then. But I would just be fully transparent with you and honest I want reliability to improve in the state. I want resiliency and improvement in the state for our customers. And so if they have findings on how we can do work better, my gosh, I'm just going to agree to them. Like we should build that into the next electric grid case. We should do that because we want it better for our customers. And so it doesn't bother me at all. I think this is good that we have an outside party looking and looking at how we can improve. It's only going to add to our reliability road map. And the other thing is on this performance-based rates or PBR, the work group is underway. It was initiated in the first second quarter time frame April-ish time frame I believe. And so that conversation is underway, proposal was put out. We have put comments through that process. We're continuing to participate in work groups. At the end of the day I think you're going to have a nice balance of incentives disincentives from an electric reliability perspective. But the important piece for us is making sure there's a nice line of sight into capital and the capital recovery and there's certainty. That's why we're so focused on this investment recovery mechanism. We also think the same thing is required for storm and some of the O&M expense that occurs in the year. As long as we can navigate all that and get to that point I feel good I feel good. This will lead to good outcomes for our customers.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, Garrick. Appreciate it. Thanks, Rejji.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Andrew, your line is open.\nAndrew Weisel: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: My first question is about supply chain. I know solar has been in focus. I think you just alluded to that a moment ago but how about the availability of grid level equipment like transformers or switch gears? And if you do see shortages is there a risk that might slow down your planned pace of spending?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, first of all, I appreciate your analysis. You did a nice write-up on that. It was about a week ago, two weeks ago. So some good work of what's going on in the industry. And so we're highly focused on the supply chain. I'll give it over here to Rejji a minute. He has responsibility for that area. They've done a lot of good work to be able to secure that line of sight. And so when I think about the projects we have underway, particularly those that are in mid-development. The team has done a much better job to make sure we have panels, transformers and the like so we can do that build. Now, there's longer lead times, most definitely. And so you've got to be prepared and you've got to be planned in that but the team has just done a phenomenal job. But Rejji, your team is doing great work, maybe add to it.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Thanks, Garrick. And I appreciate the question Andrew. So Garrick is exactly right. We have really been attacking challenges in supply chain for the last 18 months or so. And what we've done to really make sure that we've got sufficient supply, not just on the solar side but really across the business is we've been very focused on diversifying our vendor sources. And so that has been a very concerted effort again over the last 12 to 18 months. We've also done what we would describe as value engineering and looking at other alternatives, particularly in the context of transformers that could be compatible with our electric grid. So we historically used a standard of grain-oriented steel. We're now using amorphous core and introducing that into our system. We've also been very successful in refurbishing damage transformers and using a variety of third parties to help us with that. And so all of those countermeasures, have really led to us getting to a sufficient level of supply across our most highly used transformers. Now, there's still issues in the supply chain across a variety of materials and we're spending a lot of time on hypercare. But for those highest velocity materials, we feel like we're in really good shape at this point. So I really appreciate the question.\nGarrick Rochow: I just got to know something. Just a Rejji's dexterity great CFO, and when you can talk about amorphous core, that's really awesome to see.\nAndrew Weisel: One other question for the team here. Can you give us any updates on the legislative environment in Michigan, talking about the fact that Democrats have full control? So is there any talk of potential updates either a big change to the 2016 law or maybe more likely incremental marginal support for clean energy. Are you hearing any potential around that?\nGarrick Rochow: So I'll start with the big picture and the Governor's first term, she came out with her healthy climate plan. And that was a nice plan, supportive of the plan very pragmatic and balances clean energy, reliability of supply and affordability. And the Governor came out in August and said -- now in her second term and came out and said, hey, I want to make a portion of this into law. And that's been in the Senate right now. It started out in committee. And so there are a number of bills that were put together on that as you imagine in Committee there's a discussion and we're actively engaged in that discussion. And so that's moved on now to the full Senate for consideration still has not made it to the House. And so there's important work going on to define what that looks like. But I'll just, again, stand back and look at the bigger picture of this, much like 2008, much like 2016, this legislative body as well as the Public Service Commission continues to provide a constructive approach to the future. And we see a constructive out of these bills, if they even move forward and if they even get agreement we see a path of constructive regulation going forward and a constructive policy going forward. And so -- but that's currently where it stands, Andrew.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. We\u2019ll stay tune. Thank you very much.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Durgesh, please go ahead.\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team. Thanks. Good morning, Garrick. Thanks for taking my question. I had a few questions. You've already answered them. Just -- maybe just on the O&M savings. Obviously, you've done a great job here offsetting weather and storms, it's a big number like $0.60 $0.70 year-to-date combined impact from weather and storms. What -- like is there a way for you to quantify for us what these O&M savings that you're using? You're offsetting weather and storms with this year. How much of that can be carried forward to 2024 and beyond? I'm just looking for what level of these savings are sustainable, or are these truly one-time in nature?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Durgesh, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. And I appreciate also the compliments. We are really proud of the work done for the first three quarters of the year offsetting the headwinds we've seen on the weather side both in terms of mild weather as well as the storm activity and the organization has really rallied around the cause. Obviously, when it comes to cost savings, we never discriminate when it comes to operational versus non-operational and we've been quite expansive in our approach. To get to the spirit of your question, I think it's difficult to quantify to what degree the savings will be sustainable. And I do think a decent portion will be because when you think about the separation plan that I mentioned we reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10% and we do not assume that we will go and re-staff that over the next year or two or even next several years. And so, we'll see sustainable savings from that and that will be a significant portion. Some of the other bigger opportunities. So in Q2 the tender financing obviously that is a one-timer and so we wouldn't count on that being sustained. But there are other opportunities we've executed on. We've been really disciplined and rationalizing our contractor base and some of the consultants we're working with again, we'd like to think we can sustain that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we accelerated some longer-term IT projects and we think we'll see productivity from those actions for some time now. So I'd say it's tough to really ascribe a specific percentage, but I'd say decent portion should be sustained going into next year and will provide some tailwinds when you think about not just our guidance next year but also affordability because we always look forward to passing on those savings on the customers. And the last thing I'll note is on the financing side, we've seen quite a few efficiencies with the convert where we pulled ahead some costs that we were going to have or some financing needs we had in 2024. That's going to have a sustained level of savings and the operating company financings we've done those in a really efficient fashion at a weighted average coupon of 4.8% below plan. And so we'll see sustained savings from that. So I'd say on the operational and non-operational side you've got some one-timers and then some of that will be sustained but I can't give you a specific percentage at this point.\nDurgesh Chopra: That\u2019s very helpful color, Rejji. I appreciate it. And then maybe one just quick clarification on the financing point, I'm not trying to jump that down here but you mentioned you're going to update us on the Q4 call. But for 2024 next year still no equity that's still accurate correct?\nRejji Hayes: That's exactly right.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thank you.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today is from the line of David Arcaro of Morgan Stanley. David, please go ahead.\nRejji Hayes: Hi, David.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my question. You alluded to this on the last question, but maybe just directly on as you look into 2024 what's your comfort level you've pulled a lot of cost levers for this year to the extent there are any incremental challenges into 2024. But do you still feel like you're setting up with the same quantum of flexibility around cost structure and the overall expense structure as you look toward hitting your guidance next year?\nRejji Hayes: Yeah David. Appreciate the question. This is Rejji. So as you think about the glide path to deliver on the guidance we initiated today, we're guiding $3.06 to $3.12 in 2023 and then $3.27 to $3.33 in 2024. And so that implies somewhere around $0.20 of pickup year-over-year to get to midpoint to midpoint or thereabouts. And so as I think about it, obviously, the weather we had this year we're looking at roughly $0.30 of weather and that's just the mild weather experience over the first three quarters of the year and we anticipate basically being flat in the fourth quarter. So you have to imagine that because we plan for normal weather, we shouldn't anticipate that $0.30 of weather impacting us next year. Now the reality is there have been some one-timers as I've mentioned in my prior remarks on the tender financing side. And so we'd have to assume that those don't recur as well. And so when you net the two of those out you get about $0.10 of pickup. And then if you think about the pending rate case we have. We had a very constructive gas rate case settlement in the third quarter of this year that was approved by the commission. We've got a pending electric rate case and then we'll file another gas rate case in December this year. And with the anticipation of constructive outcomes on those proceedings that offers about per-preliminary estimates maybe somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15 net of investment related costs of pickup. And then again a lot of the cost savings I enumerated earlier, we expect a decent portion of those to be sustained and so we'll get additional pickup there. And so you can get to a glide path of that $0.20 per share again for that year-over-year growth relatively easily when you look at those pieces. Now there are always puts and takes. And again there are some things that will roll off going into 2024. And I think what's highly debatable is will we see the same quantum of service restoration expense going into next year because clearly we've had a record level of storm activity as I noted in our prepared remarks. And so as we think about the glide path it's going to be a combination of rate relief, net of investment-related costs with our pending proceedings. We'll see the weather roll off. We'll see some of the one-timers roll off. And then we expect some of the savings from a lot of the cost reduction initiatives to provide a tailwind on a net basis next year as well. So that's what gives us confidence that we can deliver on the 2024 guide. Is that helpful?\nDavid Arcaro: Yeah, very helpful. I appreciate all the color. All good points. And let's see what also just going to check on could you just give the latest update in terms of what you're seeing with the voluntary green pricing program potential upside from that program and just expectations for how customer additions could trend from here? \nGarrick Rochow: Yeah, it continues to be very positive. And so remember we're in what I'd call a tranche of 1,000 megawatts that is being contracted out. There's significant demand from our customers for those products. We're well over 400 megawatts of contracted lower that continues to grow. And then that's driving to more build from a renewable perspective. And so we've announced even within the quarter the intent to build a solar facility in the current -- coal facility that will help meet some of that -- a portion of that need. So again very robust continued strong interest from our commercial and industrial customers.\nDavid Arcaro: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question today is from the line of Nicholas Campanella of Barclays. Nicholas, please go ahead.\nNicholas Campanella: Hey, thanks for taking my question everyone. Just one for me. A lot of them have been answered. But I guess just looking at the resiliency plan you kind of start to show the SADI scores improving '25, '26, but I was just trying to dig in more on how you're thinking about operational risk reduction for '24. Just given lessons learned from last year's storm cycle and I assume you're probably actively deploying some of this technology now. So just how should we kind of think about storm risk '24 versus this year? Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Great question. I'm glad you're digging into it. That's a fun plan to look at. Right now -- and that's why I shared in some of my prepared remarks like we're not waiting. And the commission has been supportive of additional tree removal or vegetation management. That's more than doubled our spend over the last three years. So that's active work that's underway. There's close to 300 crews that are on our system contracted crews that are out doing that work today and have been over the course of the year. And we -- in those areas where we do the work we see greater than a 60% improvement well underway. In addition to that fusing, 15,000 fuses over the last two years and a plan to do more next year as well. That takes -- when there's an interruption on the system like fuse box in your home. And so rather than the whole home going out you might lose the bathroom or the kitchen. Same type of thing on the electric. We're fusing that. So when there's an interruption, less customers are impacted. We're seeing SADI performance improvement already from the deployment of those fuses. We've never done this level of fusing, never across our history. We continue to add automation. I just saw a great one the other day being able to -- one of the things on our high-voltage distribution system we've got what's called a Victor insulator. Now Victor insulators are prone to failure. That's a known problem. But once you put them on the grid back in the '70s we didn't have the best kind of control on where those went. And so to be able to identify them you got to be able to see the small little D on top of the Victor insulator. Before we got to stick a bucket truck up there to see that. That's very inefficient. Now with drones, with the ability to automatically pull from a picture to see that little D, we're able to find that find those victor insulators and be very strategic about replacing them. So I'm excited about the technology we're bringing to bear as well. And so those are just a few examples. There are hundreds of examples like we are not satisfied with our reliability performance. We are going to make it better. We've seen the improvement over 2022. We continue to be on good pace this year even with the storms. And so -- and we're going to keep the -- sorry with the analogy, we're keeping the foot down on the floor on the accelerator on this.\nNicholas Campanella: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Travis, please go ahead.\nTravis Miller: Good morning everyone. Thank you. On the distribution plan, I wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you expect the timing of the regulatory review on that to be?\nGarrick Rochow: It's going to be -- those will get woven into electric rate case filings. And so the plan by itself will get some comment, but that's not a contested filing. What will happen is those -- that will be the -- it's truly a road map. It's really a vision of where we're headed and the important pieces that have to come together for that. And so, those get brought into electric rate case filings and then with commission support they can be approved. I would just highlight one thing, one announcement we've had here in the last couple of weeks though Department of Energy grant of $100 million. That really jump starts some of this important work. And so, again to the previous question, we're not waiting around. We see some opportunities to put this to work immediately. But again the regulatory process is through the rate cases.\nTravis Miller: Okay. So that suggests you probably continue that annual type run rate of electric rate cases and even potentially gas rate cases, but especially the electric. Is that roughly correct?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, you should expect an annual rate case type filing and I would just offer to in these particularly with the interest rates the way they are 10-month rate cases and forward-looking test years and the kind of the annual strategy really eliminates some of that drag that you get with higher interest rates. And so, there's a lot of benefits of that approach.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then just real quick with the investment recovery mechanism change that timing at all, or still even if you get that still kind of a 1-year sort of rate.\nGarrick Rochow: It will still be a one-year approach. The IRM is not big enough at this point. It's a starting spot. And over time, we'd look to enhance that. The first step is to get it in place which is part of this current electric rate case.\nTravis Miller: Okay. Very good. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Travis.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Sophie Karp with KeyBanc. Sophie, please go ahead.\nSophie Karp: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A lot of questions have been answered but I wanted to ask you about the cost of capital and like the ROEs, right? So a bit of a push-pull in Michigan as in many other states right now. I'm just kind of curious how the conversations about the need for higher ROE lending with the stakeholders at the commission. Like I'm not sure a few people are catching on to how fast the rates have risen and that really needs to you're going to have some adjustment to how they are as viewed I guess in the last few years. So any color on that would be helpful.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Sophie, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Let me just start by saying we're certainly making the case and have made the case really for the last few years around the need to have higher ROEs just given the changing cost of capital environment. I think treasuries probably a couple of hundred basis points higher than where they were when we first had 9.9% established as the prevailing ROE across our electric and gas businesses and DTs and parity as well. And so we're certainly making the case. And I think the case becomes stronger and stronger every day as we see continued hawkish monetary policy. So I think if \u2013 to give you any confidence I think it's \u2013 we feel very good about the fact that there's a good floor at the 9.9% prevailing ROE but we're going to continue to make the case that it should be higher. As Garrick noted, we're seeking 10.25% in our pending electric case. And again, I think the data support that point of view. And we try to make the case in addition to all the different ways in which you can calculate the cost of equity. The fact is that we compete for capital against other utilities and other jurisdictions. And given the quantum of capital that we have not just in our current 5-year plan but in what we anticipate being our next and subsequent 5-year plans we do think we need to be as competitive as possible on all fronts because you can take your dollars elsewhere as investors. And so we've been making the case loudly and clearly I think DTE as well and hopefully we can start to see a change in the wind here with respect to ROEs.\nSophie Karp: Got it. Thank you. And then maybe if I can squeeze one more in. You've been doing your underground in pilots. And I'm just curious what have you learned so far from this pilot project maybe in terms of cost or approach that needs to be taken. Curious if you can provide any color on how that is going.\nGarrick Rochow: Well just a point of clarification what's introduced in the electric case is a pilot a pilot of 10 miles. And as I shared small but important so that the Public Service Commission has the opportunity to evaluate \u2013 now we do do undergrounding already. We do it in the context of subdivisions and the like and we have done a couple of trial runs. And what we've seen is very cost effective because of our gas business directional drilling underground is one of our specialties. We certainly have the equipment and the expertise to do that. And so we're able to be very competitive from an underground perspective. Now our plan stays out of congested area, stays out of 3-phase construction. And so we're talking single phase more royal construction where you have the right floor conditions and we do over much Michigan, which helps from a cost perspective. And so we've shared historically \u2013 historically more current I guess in the $350,000 a mile is we think very achievable.\nSophie Karp: All right. Thank you so much.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today is from the line of Anthony Crowdell of Mizuho. Anthony, your line is open.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, all of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much. I am good.\nGarrick Rochow: Good to hear from you, Anthony.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ross Fowler of UBS. Ross, your line is now open.\nRoss Fowler: Hi, Garrick, hi, Rejji how are you?\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Ross.\nRejji Hayes: Hey, Ross. How are you?\nRoss Fowler: Good morning. Let's take it to the full hour why not. And Garrick there\u2019s lot as many auto \u2013 auto analogies as you'd like in the answer to this question. But I just wanted to get an update on the estimated bills meter installation issue given the commission filed that show cost a couple of days ago. So I know Rejji kind of talked about this back when I saw in August but just an update there. And then the second part of the question is do you think that has any sort of lateral impacts on the rate case proceeding, or from your perspective is the commission really looking at these as two separate filings and issues.\nGarrick Rochow: So I don't know if I have any auto analogies for this one. We talked about this in great detail and I provide probably a long answer maybe too long an answer on the Q2 call. So I'll try to be brief but this is just the next step in that. And so what I shared back again briefly what I shared in Q2 was recall that we had some 3G meters that were no longer supported. Our vendor could not meet some of the supply chain needs again considered a carryover from the pandemic and did not meet some of the read required reads out in the field. And so that creates some billing issues for our customers. That's a problem. And the Public Service Commission clearly identified that. And so we shared in our Q2 call that that issue is behind us. We filed a report in August and this is the next step to reach resolution. And so I don't it's an important step. It gets us to the final end of this with the commission. I don't see any spillover impact into the electric rate case or in any other filings.\nRoss Fowler: All right. Thank you very much.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Ross.\nOperator: And we have no further questions in the queue today. So I'd like to hand back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any final remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Harry and I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you at EEI. Please take care and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick and good morning, everyone. As Garrick noted, we had a solid third quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share, driven by numerous cost reduction initiatives which have largely offset the headwinds that we have faced throughout the year most recently in the form of a severe storm that hit our electric service territory in August. To put the weather we have experienced in 2023 into perspective, we are approaching a record level of storm activity this year, which further supports the needed investments in our electric system that Garrick highlighted, and we have seen heating and cooling degree days of 11% and 24% below historical levels respectively on a year-to-date basis. That said, we do not make excuses and have implemented numerous countermeasures throughout the year to mitigate these risks and are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives this year, the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year and on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $2.06 per share given our progress in the aforementioned countermeasures which I'll elaborate on shortly. In the waterfall chart on Slide 7, for clarification purposes all of the variance analysis therein are measured relative to the comparable periods in 2022. The actuals are quantified on a year-to-date basis and the prospective period reflects the final three months of the year. Starting with actuals with respect to weather. The previously noted unfavorable weather experience in 2023 has driven $0.49 per share of negative go. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.20 per share of positive variance, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance through the third quarter has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses to the tune of $0.21 per share of negative variance due to higher service restoration expenses attributable to storms. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses exclusive of service restoration expense are down roughly 10% versus the third quarter of 2022, which highlights the significant cost performance we've realized across the business. To that end and as previously noted, we implemented numerous cost reduction initiatives early in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT projects and eliminating other discretionary spending. We have also supplemented these efforts with a voluntary separation program or VSP that reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10%. And more importantly, as we leverage the CE Way our lean operating system, we will continue to eliminate waste and increase productivity going forward. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note that $0.27 per share of positive variance highlighted the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. We've seen this bar increase throughout the year, as a result of our continued success in realizing cost savings through financing efficiencies, liability management, strong tax planning and favorable non-weather sales in our electric business during the summer. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, as always we plan for normal weather, which we expect will have a neutral impact on our financial performance versus the fourth quarter of 2022. And we expect a similar financial impact for rate relief net of investment-related costs as the benefits of our recent gas rate case settlement and our 2022 electric rate case settlement are largely offset by the absence tax benefits associated with the prior gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective as noted during our Q2 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility, driven by the ongoing benefit cost reduction initiatives, which equates to $0.17 per share of targeted variance. It is also worth noting that the Q4 2022 comp for this bucket is notably soft given the higher-than-average O&M expenses incurred during that period. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, you'll note in the penultimate that yellow bar on the right that we're anticipating $0.23 to $0.29 per share a positive variance. As we've discussed previously, the key drivers here are the absence of significant discretionary actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to last year's electric rate case settlement and the filing of our voluntary refund mechanism which collectively equate to $0.12 per share. The remaining notable items that we anticipate in this bucket are from North Star our non-utility business achieving its full year guidance and favorable non-weather sales at the utility, which have trended well over the past few quarters. All in, we remain confident in our ability to meet our EPS guidance for the year. And as always we'll take none of this positive momentum for granted and will approach these last two months of the year with the usual degree of paranoia by maintaining our cost discipline and flex additional opportunities as needed to deliver the consistent financial results you have come to expect. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings. Our financing strategy and strong balance sheet position us well given the market volatility we've seen recently. At the utility, our annual rate case cadence and the use of forward-looking test years allow us to incorporate higher interest rates into our filings and recover the associated costs with minimal lag. At the parent where funding costs are non-recoverable, we have limited refinancing risk in the near term with $250 million due in 2024 and 2025 and $300 million coming due in 2026. And as noted during our second quarter call, the 2024 maturity has already been prefunded with proceeds from our convertible debt issuance in May. It is also worth noting that 100% of the debt of the parent companies fixed is over 40% is hybrid in nature thus receiving equity credit from the rating agencies. In addition to strong liability management, we have continued to plan conservatively. And debt funding costs have increased in the current environment they remain consistent with the assumptions embedded in our long-term financial plan. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings for the benefit of our customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023. In short, I'm pleased to report that our financing plan for the year is largely completed. In fact at the utility, we've completed all of our planned first mortgage bond issuances for the year at a weighted average coupon of approximately 4.8%, which is below our planned estimate. The only remaining opco financing is a securitization funding to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base in our recently retired coal facilities. As for the parent company given the timing of the aforementioned convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards at price last year. So the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled in the fourth quarter. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of customers and investments. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks and for the Q&A session. Good morning. Julien Congratulations on the announcement there and good work on your team. Shar this is Rejji. Yeah, so we're still in the relatively early stage of building out -- sorry Shar? Shar, this is Rejji if you can hear me. So we're in the early stages of rolling out our five-year plan. So we're still calibrating where -- what the financing needs will be. As I've said before, the estimate that we have in our current five-year plan, where we said up to $350 million a year of equity starting in 2025. I don't see that number materially changing. Now, as the CapEx plan increases again we always recalibrate you may see a slight shift upward but we -- we have to take a look at all of the puts and takes the capital investments the cash flow generation. And I think at the end of the day you're not going to see us with any sort of need to do block equity. I still think even without seeing the numbers we'll be able to double out the equity in those outer years. But again, still early days on those calculations. Yes. Thanks, Garrick. And I appreciate the question Andrew. So Garrick is exactly right. We have really been attacking challenges in supply chain for the last 18 months or so. And what we've done to really make sure that we've got sufficient supply, not just on the solar side but really across the business is we've been very focused on diversifying our vendor sources. And so that has been a very concerted effort again over the last 12 to 18 months. We've also done what we would describe as value engineering and looking at other alternatives, particularly in the context of transformers that could be compatible with our electric grid. So we historically used a standard of grain-oriented steel. We're now using amorphous core and introducing that into our system. We've also been very successful in refurbishing damage transformers and using a variety of third parties to help us with that. And so all of those countermeasures, have really led to us getting to a sufficient level of supply across our most highly used transformers. Now, there's still issues in the supply chain across a variety of materials and we're spending a lot of time on hypercare. But for those highest velocity materials, we feel like we're in really good shape at this point. So I really appreciate the question. Yes. Durgesh, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. And I appreciate also the compliments. We are really proud of the work done for the first three quarters of the year offsetting the headwinds we've seen on the weather side both in terms of mild weather as well as the storm activity and the organization has really rallied around the cause. Obviously, when it comes to cost savings, we never discriminate when it comes to operational versus non-operational and we've been quite expansive in our approach. To get to the spirit of your question, I think it's difficult to quantify to what degree the savings will be sustainable. And I do think a decent portion will be because when you think about the separation plan that I mentioned we reduced our salaried workforce by roughly 10% and we do not assume that we will go and re-staff that over the next year or two or even next several years. And so, we'll see sustainable savings from that and that will be a significant portion. Some of the other bigger opportunities. So in Q2 the tender financing obviously that is a one-timer and so we wouldn't count on that being sustained. But there are other opportunities we've executed on. We've been really disciplined and rationalizing our contractor base and some of the consultants we're working with again, we'd like to think we can sustain that. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we accelerated some longer-term IT projects and we think we'll see productivity from those actions for some time now. So I'd say it's tough to really ascribe a specific percentage, but I'd say decent portion should be sustained going into next year and will provide some tailwinds when you think about not just our guidance next year but also affordability because we always look forward to passing on those savings on the customers. And the last thing I'll note is on the financing side, we've seen quite a few efficiencies with the convert where we pulled ahead some costs that we were going to have or some financing needs we had in 2024. That's going to have a sustained level of savings and the operating company financings we've done those in a really efficient fashion at a weighted average coupon of 4.8% below plan. And so we'll see sustained savings from that. So I'd say on the operational and non-operational side you've got some one-timers and then some of that will be sustained but I can't give you a specific percentage at this point. That's exactly right. Thank you. Hi, David. Yeah David. Appreciate the question. This is Rejji. So as you think about the glide path to deliver on the guidance we initiated today, we're guiding $3.06 to $3.12 in 2023 and then $3.27 to $3.33 in 2024. And so that implies somewhere around $0.20 of pickup year-over-year to get to midpoint to midpoint or thereabouts. And so as I think about it, obviously, the weather we had this year we're looking at roughly $0.30 of weather and that's just the mild weather experience over the first three quarters of the year and we anticipate basically being flat in the fourth quarter. So you have to imagine that because we plan for normal weather, we shouldn't anticipate that $0.30 of weather impacting us next year. Now the reality is there have been some one-timers as I've mentioned in my prior remarks on the tender financing side. And so we'd have to assume that those don't recur as well. And so when you net the two of those out you get about $0.10 of pickup. And then if you think about the pending rate case we have. We had a very constructive gas rate case settlement in the third quarter of this year that was approved by the commission. We've got a pending electric rate case and then we'll file another gas rate case in December this year. And with the anticipation of constructive outcomes on those proceedings that offers about per-preliminary estimates maybe somewhere between $0.10 to $0.15 net of investment related costs of pickup. And then again a lot of the cost savings I enumerated earlier, we expect a decent portion of those to be sustained and so we'll get additional pickup there. And so you can get to a glide path of that $0.20 per share again for that year-over-year growth relatively easily when you look at those pieces. Now there are always puts and takes. And again there are some things that will roll off going into 2024. And I think what's highly debatable is will we see the same quantum of service restoration expense going into next year because clearly we've had a record level of storm activity as I noted in our prepared remarks. And so as we think about the glide path it's going to be a combination of rate relief, net of investment-related costs with our pending proceedings. We'll see the weather roll off. We'll see some of the one-timers roll off. And then we expect some of the savings from a lot of the cost reduction initiatives to provide a tailwind on a net basis next year as well. So that's what gives us confidence that we can deliver on the 2024 guide. Is that helpful? Yes, Sophie, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. Let me just start by saying we're certainly making the case and have made the case really for the last few years around the need to have higher ROEs just given the changing cost of capital environment. I think treasuries probably a couple of hundred basis points higher than where they were when we first had 9.9% established as the prevailing ROE across our electric and gas businesses and DTs and parity as well. And so we're certainly making the case. And I think the case becomes stronger and stronger every day as we see continued hawkish monetary policy. So I think if \u2013 to give you any confidence I think it's \u2013 we feel very good about the fact that there's a good floor at the 9.9% prevailing ROE but we're going to continue to make the case that it should be higher. As Garrick noted, we're seeking 10.25% in our pending electric case. And again, I think the data support that point of view. And we try to make the case in addition to all the different ways in which you can calculate the cost of equity. The fact is that we compete for capital against other utilities and other jurisdictions. And given the quantum of capital that we have not just in our current 5-year plan but in what we anticipate being our next and subsequent 5-year plans we do think we need to be as competitive as possible on all fronts because you can take your dollars elsewhere as investors. And so we've been making the case loudly and clearly I think DTE as well and hopefully we can start to see a change in the wind here with respect to ROEs. Hey, Ross. How are you?"

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri and thank you everyone for joining us today. What sets us apart in this industry is clear and it's been proven for over two decades are simple cleaner and leaner investment thesis. We've talked about this in many calls in many investor meetings and it works a long and robust capital runway, a best-in-class ability to take cost out of the business, to create headroom for needed investments and keep bills affordable for customers. Couple that with a constructive top-tier regulatory environment and that is our recipe for premium total shareholder return. Today I want to highlight one part of our investment thesis, infrastructure renewal. It starts with our five-year $15.5 billion capital plan which supports a long runway for important customer investments. This allows us to do what is most important for our customers deliver safe, reliable, affordable energy and lead the industry in the clean energy transformation. We are one of the first vertically integrated utilities to switch from coal to clean by 2025 leading the industry with net zero carbon by 2040 aligned with customers, policymakers and our strategic plan positioning us for the future. In our gas business, we are on pace to net zero methane by 2030 and with a 20% reduction in Scope 3 emissions one of the few in the industry making the gas system safer and cleaner. And in our electric distribution system, we are hardening the grid to make it more reliable today while preparing for the resiliency that will be required for EVs, connected devices and to mitigate impact of climate change. Our electric distribution system is vast covering much of the lower Peninsula of Michigan, but it's aging. We are seeing more frequent and severe weather which proves the future or require something different because our customers count on us for reliable service. Last month we filed our electric reliability road map with the Michigan Public Service Commission, which outlined our plan to improve reliability and prepare the system for greater resiliency. Over the last 20 years, we've seen an increase in both the frequency of storms and higher wind speed with some of the most extreme wins within the last four years. We're clearly seeing the effects of climate change. Given this in the increasing dependency on the electric distribution system, we have set forward a plan that bolsters the system now and builds for the future. We worked with the leading industry research institute EPRI benchmarking companies as well as advancing technology to build a robust and comprehensive plan. This five-year electric reliability road map calls for $7 billion of capital investment to harden the system, expand undergrounding, update infrastructure, increase capacity and advanced automation. To give you a small snapshot, our plan includes roughly 1,000 miles of system undergrounding in the near-term and longer term significantly more undergrounding to ensure our system is prepared to withstand severe weather. Originally our design standard was for 40-mile per hour wind. With the wind speeds we are seeing today, our new standard is for 80-mile per hour wind and 0.5 inch of ice loading. This plan also includes further automation in machine modeling adding technology to more precisely locate and isolate damage, reroute power and better predict problem areas keeping more customers online in responding to outages faster. We put our stake in the ground. We've identified the steps to improve reliability a step change and build an electric grid that can better withstand extreme weather and better serve our customers in the future. With commission support this plan will reduce the frequency and duration of outages while moving us into second quartile for reliability coupled with additional customer investments the longer-term vision delivers a grid or no outage will affect more than 100,000 customers and no customer will be without power for more than 24 hours. We expect these investments to be part of our upcoming electric rate case filings and will be implemented upon commission approval. And let me be clear, we are already making progress. We've doubled our investment in vegetation management over the last three years shortening our trim cycles. We've seen greater than 60% benefit where we've done the work. We've increased the amount of customer investments and upgrades using in hardening installing nearly 15,000 used devices in the last two years more than we've ever done reducing the number of customers impacted for interruption. We've increased our maintenance inspection frequency mining potential failures before they occur. And just last week we were notified that of the nearly 300 companies who applied for grants on the Department of Energy, we were one of seven companies who were awarded $100 million for specializing and improving circuit in disadvantaged communities. This is great for our company and our customers. First it accelerates investment, which were already part of our $7 billion electric reliability road map; second this strikes the important balance of reliability improvement and affordability; and finally because these are matching grant that provides greater line of sight and certainty recovery of these needed customer investments. We take our commitment to serve seriously what our customers deserve. We wake up every day to deliver. That's why we constructed our electric reliability road map. On Slide 5 I want to take a moment to provide an update on our regulatory calendar. In September, we revised our position in our electric rate case to $169 million and maintained our position for a 10.25% ROE and a 51.5% equity ratio. We're requesting approval of a 10-mile undergrounding pilot with plans to underground over 400 miles annually beginning in 2027, which aligns with our electric reliability road map, a small but important step in building out a program that can be supported by the Michigan Public Service Commission and will deliver significant improvement for our customers. We also requested a recovery mechanism for investments in our electric distribution system to improve reliability. Similar to the mechanism we've utilized in our gas business, which creates greater clarity on the investment end customer benefit while improving certainty of recovery. We expect the final order by March of next year. We also recently received approval from the Michigan Public Service Commission on our gas rate case settlement providing continued value for our customers and investors. These rates became effective October 1. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. This case brings a continued focus on a safe, reliable, affordable and clean natural gas system will support needed customer investment. As we've shared in previous calls and in investor meetings, we continue to see the Michigan regulatory jurisdiction as constructive in providing a good balance for all stakeholders leading up to its ranking as top tier. Moving on to the financials. For the third quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.61 and $2.06 per share year-to-date. Rejji will provide additional details but despite a significant storm in the third quarter, we remain on track to deliver on our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share and expect to deliver toward the high end. Given that confidence, we are initiating our full year guidance for 2024 at $3.27 to $3.33 per share reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range and we are well positioned just like 2023 to be toward the high end of that range. It is also important to remember that we always rebased guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call impounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. Like we've done in previous years we'll provide you with an update on our 2024 guidance based off of actuals, as well as a refresh of our 5-year capital plan on the Q4 call. We continue to be confident in our ability to deliver the year and in our longer-term outlook providing exceptional value for all stakeholders. With that I'll hand it over to Rejji to offer some additional details. Thank you Rejji. You hear us say it every year. We deliver. Our track record spans two decades of consistently delivering industry-leading results in all conditions for all stakeholders. This year be no different. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Hey, Jeremy, how are you? Good morning. Great question, Jeremy. I feel good about the progress of our electric rate case. And just to give you a little flavor on where we're at with that. In rebuttal we came back at $169 million. And as I shared in my prepared remarks 10.25% ROE and 51.5% equity ratio. And that reflects just the differences in the business from when we built the case to where we're at now in the forward-looking test year. Staff is at $88 million. And so the gap is pretty small between our ask and where the staff is which again I see is very constructive. And so we're really at a constructive starting point in the conversation. And much of that delta is made up with -- it's just really the cost of capital ROE and equity ratio. That's a big piece of the difference. And there's a few other what I call cats and dogs, important cash is the dog nonetheless but things that we are helpful for our customers. And so that's the big difference. Now let's talk a little bit about settlement in the context of settlement. And I've certainly been in a number of these calls where I'm open to settlement and settlement presents itself that's great. And we're certainly receptive to that. But as you pointed out there is an important mechanism in there and there's undergrounding. Those are two key things that we need to see come out of this case. Investment recovery mechanism to have some certainty on our distribution, let distribution investments in this underground pilot. This is important to get started, and there's a real benefit for our customers. And so those are harder to get in settlement just to be fully transparent. Typically, they're a black box when you go through settlement. And so we're prepared to go to the full distance. And I'll just be honest with the entire call it's likely we're going to go the full distance and I have confidence that we can get a really constructive outcome going to a full order. Yes. Our non-utility growth continues to be small in the bigger scheme of things. Our primary business continues to be the utility space. So it's about a 95,5 [ph] mix. And as shared in the prepared remarks we expect them to be within guidance range. And so that's a good piece. It continues to be contracted renewables. And again Rejji uses these words singles and doubles. We're not swinging for the fences here. So just thoughtful contracted renewables. They have a utility-like return, long-term contracts assuming no terminal value again really conservative almost utility-like. And then there's the Dearborn Industrial Generation or DIG. And we continue to see upward pressure on energy and capacity prices. And so we're fully contracted out to 2025, with energy and capacity. And so we're filling in 2026 2027 in the out years. We plan conservatively, but those bilaterals and the contracts that we are inking are certainly better than expectations. Now don't read into that a sugar high. You've heard me say no sugar highs in the past. So you can anticipate 6% to 8% growth, on this again expectation toward the high side of that growth. And so we'll continue to reinvest as needed versus the sugar high. So hopefully, that's helpful as we see North Star Hey, Julien. I'm really excited about this plan. We've talked about -- we've seen the storms this year and certainly we have an opportunity to improve reliability, in the here and now and then prepare for the an aging system a system that's seen higher wins and more severe weather and preparing for the future. So, the team has really done a nice job of putting a good plan together. Now when I look at the five years, it's more than an incremental $1 billion. It's an incremental $3 billion, right? What's right in the plan right now is $4 billion, in our five-year plan. Now I want to be really careful and really clear about this. And so when we get to the Q4 call, we're going to grow our capital. You can expect we're going to grow our capital. You can expect with these needs on the distribution system that it's going to be biased or it's going to be more growth in the on the electric distribution system. So that $4 billion number should grow. That's what I would anticipate and expect. However, I wouldn't just do the simple math of taking 15.5 and adding $3 billion to it. And that would get you the wrong answer to the wrong number. It's important that we get commission support. And as we go through the steps, we'll get that in the rate case filing and we'll weave that in to that capital plan over time. But it should give you a picture of the strength of our five-year plan. It is robust. There's plenty of opportunities out there and that extends even beyond 10 years into a really nice long capital runway. Its helpful Julien. Yes. And similar to my previous answer here on this that Dearborn Industrial generation we take a very conservative utility-like approach. And as you know over time we've just stacked in contracts for energy and capacity bilateral contracts to make sure that we are avoiding risk and market volatility. But we certainly, see some upward pressure on both energy and capacity prices as you noted. And so much of the energy and capacity is already -- contracts are already in place through 2025. but we're filling in the gaps at 2026 2027 and out years. We plan conservatively and those contracts are I would say, exceeding our expectations or exceeding our plan, which is great. And so we'll continue to operate just as we have historically in a really conservative mode and a conservative plan, but you can see we're layering in the future right now and feel good about the opportunities for growth at DIG. We feel good about our renewable build. And in this electric rate case, we pulled out some of the renewable build. But I'll be honest with you, 25 years in this business been in engineering operations much of my career. There's projects and contracts that move between years. That's not a big deal. And much of our build this year is in wind. We're going to be COD here end of the year at our Heartland wind farm. We're building another 201 megawatts of wind. And so there's a lot of renewable build that's underway in these years. And so those projects that were referenced in the electric rate case were some of the ones that early got caught up in some of the ops and solar complaint-related issues. We've talked about that that's been hashed through in this industry. I felt good about the projects we have in mid-development right now. We have line of sight into panels. We got good sighting pieces. And so that will play out as part of our IRP build. The other thing is, these all projects don't go away. Remember that, these are part of the IRP. And so they'll get constructed here. It's just a matter of timing and that timing is being refined here. And I think at least one of them is going to go this year anyway so we're going to see some construction there. And remember, because they're approved in the IRP they get AFUDC along the way. So there's no earnings impact. Make sense? Yeah. Thanks, Julien. So there's two pieces. And I wouldn't put a negative take on it. All the conversations we have with staff and commissioners continue to be constructive and frankly we're both aligned in the same thing. We want to improve reliability. We have a longer-term view of resiliency. And when we're aligned it makes for constructive conversations. But there's two pieces that I'm hearing in your question Shar. There's one there's the audit that's underway. That was started in September. Liberty Consulting Group is the one doing the work. They've participated with other utilities very skilled organization. Right now they're in the data collection phase that's well underway. We expect an interim report about the end of the year and then a full report likely in the September-ish time frame. It's not about a year report then. But I would just be fully transparent with you and honest I want reliability to improve in the state. I want resiliency and improvement in the state for our customers. And so if they have findings on how we can do work better, my gosh, I'm just going to agree to them. Like we should build that into the next electric grid case. We should do that because we want it better for our customers. And so it doesn't bother me at all. I think this is good that we have an outside party looking and looking at how we can improve. It's only going to add to our reliability road map. And the other thing is on this performance-based rates or PBR, the work group is underway. It was initiated in the first second quarter time frame April-ish time frame I believe. And so that conversation is underway, proposal was put out. We have put comments through that process. We're continuing to participate in work groups. At the end of the day I think you're going to have a nice balance of incentives disincentives from an electric reliability perspective. But the important piece for us is making sure there's a nice line of sight into capital and the capital recovery and there's certainty. That's why we're so focused on this investment recovery mechanism. We also think the same thing is required for storm and some of the O&M expense that occurs in the year. As long as we can navigate all that and get to that point I feel good I feel good. This will lead to good outcomes for our customers. Hi, Andrew. Well, first of all, I appreciate your analysis. You did a nice write-up on that. It was about a week ago, two weeks ago. So some good work of what's going on in the industry. And so we're highly focused on the supply chain. I'll give it over here to Rejji a minute. He has responsibility for that area. They've done a lot of good work to be able to secure that line of sight. And so when I think about the projects we have underway, particularly those that are in mid-development. The team has done a much better job to make sure we have panels, transformers and the like so we can do that build. Now, there's longer lead times, most definitely. And so you've got to be prepared and you've got to be planned in that but the team has just done a phenomenal job. But Rejji, your team is doing great work, maybe add to it. I just got to know something. Just a Rejji's dexterity great CFO, and when you can talk about amorphous core, that's really awesome to see. So I'll start with the big picture and the Governor's first term, she came out with her healthy climate plan. And that was a nice plan, supportive of the plan very pragmatic and balances clean energy, reliability of supply and affordability. And the Governor came out in August and said -- now in her second term and came out and said, hey, I want to make a portion of this into law. And that's been in the Senate right now. It started out in committee. And so there are a number of bills that were put together on that as you imagine in Committee there's a discussion and we're actively engaged in that discussion. And so that's moved on now to the full Senate for consideration still has not made it to the House. And so there's important work going on to define what that looks like. But I'll just, again, stand back and look at the bigger picture of this, much like 2008, much like 2016, this legislative body as well as the Public Service Commission continues to provide a constructive approach to the future. And we see a constructive out of these bills, if they even move forward and if they even get agreement we see a path of constructive regulation going forward and a constructive policy going forward. And so -- but that's currently where it stands, Andrew. Yes. Thank you. Good morning, Durgesh. Yeah, it continues to be very positive. And so remember we're in what I'd call a tranche of 1,000 megawatts that is being contracted out. There's significant demand from our customers for those products. We're well over 400 megawatts of contracted lower that continues to grow. And then that's driving to more build from a renewable perspective. And so we've announced even within the quarter the intent to build a solar facility in the current -- coal facility that will help meet some of that -- a portion of that need. So again very robust continued strong interest from our commercial and industrial customers. Great question. I'm glad you're digging into it. That's a fun plan to look at. Right now -- and that's why I shared in some of my prepared remarks like we're not waiting. And the commission has been supportive of additional tree removal or vegetation management. That's more than doubled our spend over the last three years. So that's active work that's underway. There's close to 300 crews that are on our system contracted crews that are out doing that work today and have been over the course of the year. And we -- in those areas where we do the work we see greater than a 60% improvement well underway. In addition to that fusing, 15,000 fuses over the last two years and a plan to do more next year as well. That takes -- when there's an interruption on the system like fuse box in your home. And so rather than the whole home going out you might lose the bathroom or the kitchen. Same type of thing on the electric. We're fusing that. So when there's an interruption, less customers are impacted. We're seeing SADI performance improvement already from the deployment of those fuses. We've never done this level of fusing, never across our history. We continue to add automation. I just saw a great one the other day being able to -- one of the things on our high-voltage distribution system we've got what's called a Victor insulator. Now Victor insulators are prone to failure. That's a known problem. But once you put them on the grid back in the '70s we didn't have the best kind of control on where those went. And so to be able to identify them you got to be able to see the small little D on top of the Victor insulator. Before we got to stick a bucket truck up there to see that. That's very inefficient. Now with drones, with the ability to automatically pull from a picture to see that little D, we're able to find that find those victor insulators and be very strategic about replacing them. So I'm excited about the technology we're bringing to bear as well. And so those are just a few examples. There are hundreds of examples like we are not satisfied with our reliability performance. We are going to make it better. We've seen the improvement over 2022. We continue to be on good pace this year even with the storms. And so -- and we're going to keep the -- sorry with the analogy, we're keeping the foot down on the floor on the accelerator on this. It's going to be -- those will get woven into electric rate case filings. And so the plan by itself will get some comment, but that's not a contested filing. What will happen is those -- that will be the -- it's truly a road map. It's really a vision of where we're headed and the important pieces that have to come together for that. And so, those get brought into electric rate case filings and then with commission support they can be approved. I would just highlight one thing, one announcement we've had here in the last couple of weeks though Department of Energy grant of $100 million. That really jump starts some of this important work. And so, again to the previous question, we're not waiting around. We see some opportunities to put this to work immediately. But again the regulatory process is through the rate cases. Yes, you should expect an annual rate case type filing and I would just offer to in these particularly with the interest rates the way they are 10-month rate cases and forward-looking test years and the kind of the annual strategy really eliminates some of that drag that you get with higher interest rates. And so, there's a lot of benefits of that approach. It will still be a one-year approach. The IRM is not big enough at this point. It's a starting spot. And over time, we'd look to enhance that. The first step is to get it in place which is part of this current electric rate case. Thank you, Travis. Well just a point of clarification what's introduced in the electric case is a pilot a pilot of 10 miles. And as I shared small but important so that the Public Service Commission has the opportunity to evaluate \u2013 now we do do undergrounding already. We do it in the context of subdivisions and the like and we have done a couple of trial runs. And what we've seen is very cost effective because of our gas business directional drilling underground is one of our specialties. We certainly have the equipment and the expertise to do that. And so we're able to be very competitive from an underground perspective. Now our plan stays out of congested area, stays out of 3-phase construction. And so we're talking single phase more royal construction where you have the right floor conditions and we do over much Michigan, which helps from a cost perspective. And so we've shared historically \u2013 historically more current I guess in the $350,000 a mile is we think very achievable. Thank you. Good to hear from you, Anthony. Good morning, Ross. So I don't know if I have any auto analogies for this one. We talked about this in great detail and I provide probably a long answer maybe too long an answer on the Q2 call. So I'll try to be brief but this is just the next step in that. And so what I shared back again briefly what I shared in Q2 was recall that we had some 3G meters that were no longer supported. Our vendor could not meet some of the supply chain needs again considered a carryover from the pandemic and did not meet some of the read required reads out in the field. And so that creates some billing issues for our customers. That's a problem. And the Public Service Commission clearly identified that. And so we shared in our Q2 call that that issue is behind us. We filed a report in August and this is the next step to reach resolution. And so I don't it's an important step. It gets us to the final end of this with the commission. I don't see any spillover impact into the electric rate case or in any other filings. Thank you, Ross. Thanks, Harry and I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you at EEI. Please take care and stay safe."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CMS Energy 2023 Second Quarter Results Conference Call and News Earnings Release. The earnings news release was issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. Today's call is being recorded. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be provided at that time on how to queue-up. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 PM Eastern Time running through August 3. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We apologize for the delay as we're experiencing technical difficulties. If you have any questions and we're unable to participate on the call, please feel free to give me or Travis Uphaus a call after this earnings call. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, we deliver, we say it and we back it up. So what makes it work for all stakeholders is this investment thesis that we start with in nearly every earnings call. I've reiterated the key points of this thesis on many occasions. Today, I want to draw attention to three key components. First, we continue to make industry-leading progress on the transformation to clean energy. This is required to position the business for the future, and I will share more evidence of our good work this quarter with the exit of our coal units at our current facility and the acquisition of the Covert generating plant. Next, Michigan continues to be a solid place for investment. Our energy legislation is one of the best in the country and we operate in a top-tier regulatory environment, providing important certainty for critical customer investments and there continues to be evidence to support it. I'll share the details on our fourth consecutive settlement in our recent gas rate case. Finally, you'll hear from me on the strong progress we made in cost management, the CE Way, and other countermeasures to offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I'm pleased with the progress and remain confident in our plan to deliver 2023 and beyond. Our investment thesis is simple. It's worked for more than 20 years, regardless of conditions, to deliver the operational and financial results across the triple bottom line for all our stakeholders. At CMS Energy, we like to say leaders lead. And we are leading the clean energy transformation. We've set industry-leading, ambitious net-zero targets for both our gas and electric systems, and we continue to get it done. Our actions today serve as proof points that we can and we will achieve our targets. In June, we retired our Karn units one and two, removing 515 megawatts of coal generation from Michigan, further reducing our carbon profile. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the service of the individuals at Karn who dedicated their careers to providing energy for our customers. I had the opportunity to be there in the final days of the facility's operations, and I am proud to share the pride our coworkers have for their work. I'm also proud of the work we have done to provide a just transition, either to retirement or a new place within our company for those who served at this facility. As we transition out of coal, it is imperative that we maintain reliability for our customers in our state. And so in June, we assumed ownership in operations of the Covert generating plant. This existing 1.2 gigawatt facility maintains important low-cost, reliable electric supply in Michigan and further bolsters the MISO footprint. I'm proud to share our industry-leading commitments are being noticed, and we are now included in the MSCI ESG Leaders Index, the only vertically integrated utility to be included in this index. These are proof points, evidence in our leadership of this important transformation across the industry and will help us attract incremental capital to CMS Energy to bolster our customer investments. Adding to the good work of the quarter, we signed more contracts in our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which has now grown to 341 megawatts of owned generation, and I see further growth on the near horizon. We received approval for nearly $11 million in grants for RNG facilities to support farms we partner with as we decarbonize our gas system. And we expect our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm, which qualifies for a 10.7% ROE, will be operational later this year. While these are just a few highlights, they demonstrate what we do at CMS Energy. We set big goals, we get after it every day and we deliver, leading the clean energy transformation. Turning to Slide 5, I want to take a moment to talk about the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan. Recently, the Governor re-appointed Chair Scripps to a full term ending in 2029, and appointed Alessandra Carreon to fill the remainder of Commissioner Tremaine Phillips' term, which ends in 2025. The appointment of Commissioner Carreon, in continuity in leadership to the re-appointment of Chair Scripps, further reflect the constructive and stable nature of the Michigan regulatory environment, which remains one of the best jurisdictions in the country. We've connected with Commissioner Carreon, and she has a strong background in decarbonization, in transportation electrification, and is well-suited for the role. We look forward to working with her and this Commission. As for the regulatory calendar, our gas rate case settlement is one more in the streak of settlements and our second gas settlement in just over a year. I'm pleased with the outcome and the teams' work. This is a clear demonstration of the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, and speaks to our ability to work with multiple parties to provide the best outcome for our customers and our investors. We expect rates to go into effect October 1, for the start of the new test year. In our electric rate case, we are waiting staff's position by the end of August and a final order by March of next year. Within our filing, we are requesting approval for a small undergrounding pilot, roughly 10 miles, and plan to underground over 400 miles annually. This is an area where we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen our system and improve reliability and resiliency while aligning with our Midwest peers. Solid energy legislation, strong regulatory construct and the evidence to support it, a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. Moving on to the financials. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.75. We had a strong quarter, driven by operational and financial performance, and we continue to build contingency to the CE Way as we deliver on our year-end financial objectives. Today, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including our full-year guidance of $3.6 to $3.12 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year, with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. As I stated in our Q1 call, this is not our first rodeo. The team has done a remarkable job of mitigating the gap left from a warm winter and a large ice storm. Through the CE Way, operational cost measures, financing and other countermeasures, we have made great progress year-to-date. Year-after-year, we deliver. And this year will be no different. This is not about winning one game or one season. It's about winning multiple seasons, a winning program, continuing the long track record of consistent growth and compounding off of actuals, bringing our investors a high quality of earnings and doing year-after-year. Now, I'll hand the call over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share, driven by numerous cost-reduction initiatives foreshadowed on our Q1 call, which I will elaborate on shortly. Our financial performance over the past few months has materially offset the weather-driven challenges we faced in the first quarter. As such, as Garrick noted, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year. And on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $1.45 per share, given the back-end weighted nature of our plan this year. As you can see in the waterfall chart on Slide 7, weather has been a significant headwind to our financial performance in the first half of this year, driving $0.37 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.06 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses to the tune of $0.15 per share versus the comparable period in 2022, attributable to storm restoration costs in the first quarter. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses, which represent the majority of our O&M expense and primarily exclude costs associated with our energy waste reduction programs and employee benefits, have trended favorably during the second quarter and we're down roughly 10% versus the second quarter of 2022. So we're seeing the fruits of the numerous operational cost-reduction initiatives we put in place earlier in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT cost-reduction initiatives, and eliminating other discretionary spending. And of course, leveraging the CE Way, our lean operating system. We anticipate that our strong cost performance will continue as we move through the second half of the year. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.18 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary source of upside here was related to financing efficiencies. In short, we capitalize on attractive conditions in the convertible bond market by pricing an $800 million issuance and using the majority of the proceeds to pre-fund future parent company financing needs. Usually, pre-fundings like this are subject to negative carry. However, given the current inverted yield curve, we've managed to reinvest the proceeds at deposit rates favorable to the underlying funding cost. Lastly, we used the balance of the proceeds from the convert offering to tender a portion of select bonds well below par, which has de-levered our balance sheet. All in, this opportunistic financing transaction was earnings accretive and has further strengthened our liquidity position. Looking ahead. As always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Due to the absence of strong sales of the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer, we anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief, net of investment-related cost, which we have quantified at $0.08 per share versus the first half of 2022. Our estimates reflect the terms of our recently filed gas rate case settlement agreement, which is subject to Commission approval, and the residual benefits of our 2022 electric rate case settlement. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year. As noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense of the utility driven by the ongoing benefits of the aforementioned cost-reduction initiatives, some expected favorable year-over-year variance related to service restoration costs, and the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, which collectively equates to $0.26 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Lastly, as we discussed during our first quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share, a pull-ahead exercise in the fourth quarter of 2022. As per our original guidance, all in, we estimate these items will drive $0.17 to $0.23 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. In summary, we've made great progress to offset the challenging weather experienced in the first quarter, but needless to say, we'll continue to plan conservatively and execute as we always do. Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from Moody's. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO-to-debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility. This includes both first mortgage bond financings and a securitization financing to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base at the recently retired Karn coal facilities. As for the parent company, given the timing of the convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards that priced last year, so the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled commensurate with the needs of the business over time. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true, year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. And this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. Our track record spans two decades and consistently delivers industry-leading results in any conditions. This is what we do. We deliver for all stakeholders, year in and year out, and this year will be no different. With that, Michelle, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, good morning, Jeremy. How are you?\nRejji Hayes: Morning, Jeremy.\nJeremy Tonet: Good, good, thanks. Maybe just wanted to start off with the undergrounding pilot, if we could, and just wondering if you could expand a bit more I guess on what would define success there or I guess future outlook for how quickly that could fold into the plan in larger size over time.\nGarrick Rochow: So I've got an interesting story on this, Jeremy. I was out with our crews here about two weeks ago and we had an undergrounding in a - replacement undergrounding in a subdivision area. So remember, in Michigan, subdivisions are underground. A lot of people request their service underground. And so we know how to do this work. And in fact, we have a large gas business that does a lot of undergrounding, and so we're sharing practices back and forth. And so, again, right now, we're starting out with the pilot. And that's just a nice way to step into this with the Public Service Commission to show them our capabilities in being able to deliver that at a low cost for our customers. Again, as I've shared in past calls, the cost for undergrounding in Michigan, given the soil, given where we intend to put the undergrounding, it's really conducive and it's really almost at parity with above-ground construction. So it makes it really affordable for our customers. And so we intend to use that practice, it's recognized through EPRI as a best practice; not everywhere, but strategically or selectively across our system. And so starts with 10 miles. We've got six counties identified. We've got projects starting up in one of the North of Grand Rapids area here in about two weeks. The Public Service Commission will be on that site as well to watch that, observe that. And what we intend to grow that is about 400 miles annually. As I've shared in the past, about 10% to 15% of our system is undergrounded. Other Midwest peers, around 35% to 40%. So again, it's best practice, and we see it as a way to improve reliability and resiliency for the future.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's helpful, thank you for that. And storms have been topical in Michigan, obviously, in recent time here. And just wondering if you could provide a bit more color, I guess, on your efforts, hardening efforts and where you stand, where do you want to be to improve resiliency there, and just kind of how you feel local stakeholders are aligned against those - against this outlook in the state.\nGarrick Rochow: As I shared in the Q1 call, our focus is clearly on reliability and resiliency coming off of the large ice storm. We are making a lot of investments, considerable investments across the electric system. And we've seen good performance here over the course of the summer. Even just the last night, we had 65-mile winds come through and the system performed well with about 20,000 customers out this morning and we're quickly restoring them. And so the investments we're making - it's a large system, but the investments we're making are certainly showing benefit. So we've got a great plan. We're filing that plan here in September with the five-year - with our five-year infrastructure plan. This audit that's underway that will start here in September will be another point of alignment for the right investments across the electric system to improve reliability and resiliency. So those things are going well and our system is performing well. And so I feel good about our performance this summer, and we'll continue to be focused on it.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it, that's helpful. I'll leave it there. Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Jeremy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith at Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nHeidi Hauch: Hi, good morning. This is Heidi Hauch on for Julien. Thank you for taking my question.\nGarrick Rochow: Hi, Heidi.\nRejji Hayes: Morning.\nHeidi Hauch: Hi. Just first question, noting your plans to file another IRP in the next year or two, do you see any read-throughs for your next IRP related to the latest peer IRP settlement approved by the Michigan PSC, either from the coal retirement front, renewables investments or otherwise? Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Well, first, I want to congratulate that peer utility that had an IRP settled this week. So congratulations to the DTE team. A lot goes into those IRPs. And if you take one thing away from that IRP, it just speaks to the constructive environment here in Michigan. Four settlements for us, a settlement in IRP for DTE. That's really good. So we'll obviously look at their IRP and look at what we want to take into our next IRP. The other things that we'll consider, the Inflation Reduction Act has certainly changed PTCs and ITCs and is shaping the industry investment. Infrastructure and Jobs Act is also shaking up some things in our industry. And so all that will go into our next IRP and into some of our thinking. The IRP process takes about 12 months to 18 months to build really a thoughtful and thorough plan that we would submit to the Commission. I anticipate we'll start that process in 2024, building out that. So if you played it out, that means we file maybe late 2025/2026 timeframe. And so there's still some work to define that and tie that down, but that's our early indications of how we think about our next IRP.\nHeidi Hauch: Great, thank you. And then a second question from me, can you comment on the latest MPSC investigation into the natural gas meters and new service delays? How are you planning to address or improve these issues, and are there any potential capital opportunities that may result from this investigation? Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you for your question. It probably goes without saying this, but I'll say it anyways. We take every MPSC inquiry seriously. And from a customer perspective and bills, we got to get that right. But maybe a little background here, Heidi. Our meters communicate wirelessly. That's our Smart Grid. It's all wireless. And obviously, there's a wireless carrier that communicates that signal back to our home offices here. And as you might imagine, those wireless carriers are moving from 3G to 5G. So they're shutting down some of the 3G systems and moving to 5G. And they made us aware of that, and we were working with our meter vendor to upgrade those meters so they had the right communication components to operate at 4G and 5G technology. That process was underway. However, the meter vendor ran into supply chain problems, in part due to the pandemic, where they couldn't get the components for the meter. That delayed our deployment of these meters. And so when we walked in, in January of 2023, we had about 190,000 meters that were no longer communicating. Today that's around 33,000, and we continue to work with our meter vendor to close that and we expect that to be closed by August. As you can imagine, when those meters aren't communicating, it creates the potential for estimated reads. Our meter vendor was supposed to go out and read meters for us to close that gap. They did not meet our expectations around that and we had to step in and close that gap, which we've done and our reads are being completed and any consecutive estimates are now within historical parameters. And so from a meter perspective, from a consecutive estimate perspective, those are resolved or will be resolved in August. We owe a report to the Commission on August 4, and so we'll do that. From a materiality perspective, we've factored that in, both the reading in the meters and any penalties we may see from the Public Service Commission, and they're incorporated within our guidance that we've offered. I do not see a capital opportunity here. But rest assured that from a customer perspective and MPSC perspective, we are running this to ground, we're doing a root cause on it, make sure that it will not happen again for our customers. Thanks for your question, Heidi.\nHeidi Hauch: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sullivan: Hi, everyone, good morning. Can you hear me okay?\nGarrick Rochow: We can.\nRejji Hayes: Good morning, Mike.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, okay. Great. Hi, Garrick. Maybe this one is for Rejji. Just wanted to ask on the delay in the draw on the forward equity and just how we should think about timing there, whether that ends up getting needed at all. I think my recollection is outside of that, you had no other needs until 2025, but maybe just a little more color on what the equity picture looks like going forward, now that you've done the convert.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Yes, we will still plan to settle the equity. It will likely be, I'll say the back half of this year and deep into the second half, so call it late Q3 or in Q4. But we do still plan to settle the equity over the course of this year.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay, great. And just in terms of the impact on metrics and FFO-to-debt from the convert issuance and tender and delay in equities, does that kind of move you at all up or down to within your mid-teens target?\nRejji Hayes: No, the convert transaction was for all intents and purposes, when you take into account all the puts and takes, is effectively credit-neutral, maybe modestly accretive. And then the delay of the equity settle, again it's still going to take place over the course of this year, so again, all credit-neutral. And so we'll still be right in that mid-teens area and well in alignment with the expectations of the credit rating agencies so we can maintain our investment-grade ratings.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay, great, thank you very much.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions from the phone lines, so I will turn the conference back to you, Garrick Rochow, for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Michelle. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road too. Take care and stay safe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference call for this morning. We would like to thank you all for participating and ask you to please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick. And good morning, everyone. We had a strong second quarter, delivering adjusted earnings of $0.75 per share, driven by numerous cost-reduction initiatives foreshadowed on our Q1 call, which I will elaborate on shortly. Our financial performance over the past few months has materially offset the weather-driven challenges we faced in the first quarter. As such, as Garrick noted, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year. And on a year-to-date basis, we're on track with adjusted EPS of $1.45 per share, given the back-end weighted nature of our plan this year. As you can see in the waterfall chart on Slide 7, weather has been a significant headwind to our financial performance in the first half of this year, driving $0.37 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses has resulted in $0.06 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, driven by last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year has been significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance, or O&M, expenses to the tune of $0.15 per share versus the comparable period in 2022, attributable to storm restoration costs in the first quarter. However, it is worth noting that our operational O&M expenses, which represent the majority of our O&M expense and primarily exclude costs associated with our energy waste reduction programs and employee benefits, have trended favorably during the second quarter and we're down roughly 10% versus the second quarter of 2022. So we're seeing the fruits of the numerous operational cost-reduction initiatives we put in place earlier in the year, such as reducing our use of consultants and contractors, limiting hiring, accelerating longer-term IT cost-reduction initiatives, and eliminating other discretionary spending. And of course, leveraging the CE Way, our lean operating system. We anticipate that our strong cost performance will continue as we move through the second half of the year. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.18 per share of positive variance versus the first half of 2022, highlighted in the catch-all bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary source of upside here was related to financing efficiencies. In short, we capitalize on attractive conditions in the convertible bond market by pricing an $800 million issuance and using the majority of the proceeds to pre-fund future parent company financing needs. Usually, pre-fundings like this are subject to negative carry. However, given the current inverted yield curve, we've managed to reinvest the proceeds at deposit rates favorable to the underlying funding cost. Lastly, we used the balance of the proceeds from the convert offering to tender a portion of select bonds well below par, which has de-levered our balance sheet. All in, this opportunistic financing transaction was earnings accretive and has further strengthened our liquidity position. Looking ahead. As always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.06 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Due to the absence of strong sales of the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer, we anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief, net of investment-related cost, which we have quantified at $0.08 per share versus the first half of 2022. Our estimates reflect the terms of our recently filed gas rate case settlement agreement, which is subject to Commission approval, and the residual benefits of our 2022 electric rate case settlement. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year. As noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense of the utility driven by the ongoing benefits of the aforementioned cost-reduction initiatives, some expected favorable year-over-year variance related to service restoration costs, and the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, which collectively equates to $0.26 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Lastly, as we discussed during our first quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share, a pull-ahead exercise in the fourth quarter of 2022. As per our original guidance, all in, we estimate these items will drive $0.17 to $0.23 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. In summary, we've made great progress to offset the challenging weather experienced in the first quarter, but needless to say, we'll continue to plan conservatively and execute as we always do. Moving on to the balance sheet on Slide 8, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from Moody's. As you know, we continue to target mid-teens FFO-to-debt over our planning period. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow growth, supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 9 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are limited to debt issuances at the utility. This includes both first mortgage bond financings and a securitization financing to address the recovery of the undepreciated rate base at the recently retired Karn coal facilities. As for the parent company, given the timing of the convertible bond issuance, we've been able to delay the settlement of the equity forwards that priced last year, so the roughly $440 million of forward equity contracts will be settled commensurate with the needs of the business over time. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true, year in and year out, and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors. And this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Morning, Jeremy. Morning. Good morning, Mike. Yes, okay. Great. Hi, Garrick. Maybe this one is for Rejji. Just wanted to ask on the delay in the draw on the forward equity and just how we should think about timing there, whether that ends up getting needed at all. I think my recollection is outside of that, you had no other needs until 2025, but maybe just a little more color on what the equity picture looks like going forward, now that you've done the convert. Yes, Mike, thanks for the question. Yes, we will still plan to settle the equity. It will likely be, I'll say the back half of this year and deep into the second half, so call it late Q3 or in Q4. But we do still plan to settle the equity over the course of this year. No, the convert transaction was for all intents and purposes, when you take into account all the puts and takes, is effectively credit-neutral, maybe modestly accretive. And then the delay of the equity settle, again it's still going to take place over the course of this year, so again, all credit-neutral. And so we'll still be right in that mid-teens area and well in alignment with the expectations of the credit rating agencies so we can maintain our investment-grade ratings. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Sri. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, we deliver, we say it and we back it up. So what makes it work for all stakeholders is this investment thesis that we start with in nearly every earnings call. I've reiterated the key points of this thesis on many occasions. Today, I want to draw attention to three key components. First, we continue to make industry-leading progress on the transformation to clean energy. This is required to position the business for the future, and I will share more evidence of our good work this quarter with the exit of our coal units at our current facility and the acquisition of the Covert generating plant. Next, Michigan continues to be a solid place for investment. Our energy legislation is one of the best in the country and we operate in a top-tier regulatory environment, providing important certainty for critical customer investments and there continues to be evidence to support it. I'll share the details on our fourth consecutive settlement in our recent gas rate case. Finally, you'll hear from me on the strong progress we made in cost management, the CE Way, and other countermeasures to offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I'm pleased with the progress and remain confident in our plan to deliver 2023 and beyond. Our investment thesis is simple. It's worked for more than 20 years, regardless of conditions, to deliver the operational and financial results across the triple bottom line for all our stakeholders. At CMS Energy, we like to say leaders lead. And we are leading the clean energy transformation. We've set industry-leading, ambitious net-zero targets for both our gas and electric systems, and we continue to get it done. Our actions today serve as proof points that we can and we will achieve our targets. In June, we retired our Karn units one and two, removing 515 megawatts of coal generation from Michigan, further reducing our carbon profile. I'd like to take a moment to recognize the service of the individuals at Karn who dedicated their careers to providing energy for our customers. I had the opportunity to be there in the final days of the facility's operations, and I am proud to share the pride our coworkers have for their work. I'm also proud of the work we have done to provide a just transition, either to retirement or a new place within our company for those who served at this facility. As we transition out of coal, it is imperative that we maintain reliability for our customers in our state. And so in June, we assumed ownership in operations of the Covert generating plant. This existing 1.2 gigawatt facility maintains important low-cost, reliable electric supply in Michigan and further bolsters the MISO footprint. I'm proud to share our industry-leading commitments are being noticed, and we are now included in the MSCI ESG Leaders Index, the only vertically integrated utility to be included in this index. These are proof points, evidence in our leadership of this important transformation across the industry and will help us attract incremental capital to CMS Energy to bolster our customer investments. Adding to the good work of the quarter, we signed more contracts in our Voluntary Green Pricing program, which has now grown to 341 megawatts of owned generation, and I see further growth on the near horizon. We received approval for nearly $11 million in grants for RNG facilities to support farms we partner with as we decarbonize our gas system. And we expect our 201 megawatt Heartland wind farm, which qualifies for a 10.7% ROE, will be operational later this year. While these are just a few highlights, they demonstrate what we do at CMS Energy. We set big goals, we get after it every day and we deliver, leading the clean energy transformation. Turning to Slide 5, I want to take a moment to talk about the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan. Recently, the Governor re-appointed Chair Scripps to a full term ending in 2029, and appointed Alessandra Carreon to fill the remainder of Commissioner Tremaine Phillips' term, which ends in 2025. The appointment of Commissioner Carreon, in continuity in leadership to the re-appointment of Chair Scripps, further reflect the constructive and stable nature of the Michigan regulatory environment, which remains one of the best jurisdictions in the country. We've connected with Commissioner Carreon, and she has a strong background in decarbonization, in transportation electrification, and is well-suited for the role. We look forward to working with her and this Commission. As for the regulatory calendar, our gas rate case settlement is one more in the streak of settlements and our second gas settlement in just over a year. I'm pleased with the outcome and the teams' work. This is a clear demonstration of the constructive regulatory environment in Michigan, and speaks to our ability to work with multiple parties to provide the best outcome for our customers and our investors. We expect rates to go into effect October 1, for the start of the new test year. In our electric rate case, we are waiting staff's position by the end of August and a final order by March of next year. Within our filing, we are requesting approval for a small undergrounding pilot, roughly 10 miles, and plan to underground over 400 miles annually. This is an area where we have a lot of opportunity to strengthen our system and improve reliability and resiliency while aligning with our Midwest peers. Solid energy legislation, strong regulatory construct and the evidence to support it, a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction. Moving on to the financials. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.75. We had a strong quarter, driven by operational and financial performance, and we continue to build contingency to the CE Way as we deliver on our year-end financial objectives. Today, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including our full-year guidance of $3.6 to $3.12 per share, with continued confidence toward the high end. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings per share growth of 6% to 8% per year, with continued confidence toward the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. As I stated in our Q1 call, this is not our first rodeo. The team has done a remarkable job of mitigating the gap left from a warm winter and a large ice storm. Through the CE Way, operational cost measures, financing and other countermeasures, we have made great progress year-to-date. Year-after-year, we deliver. And this year will be no different. This is not about winning one game or one season. It's about winning multiple seasons, a winning program, continuing the long track record of consistent growth and compounding off of actuals, bringing our investors a high quality of earnings and doing year-after-year. Now, I'll hand the call over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights. Thank you, Rejji. Our track record spans two decades and consistently delivers industry-leading results in any conditions. This is what we do. We deliver for all stakeholders, year in and year out, and this year will be no different. With that, Michelle, please open the lines for Q&A. Hi, good morning, Jeremy. How are you? So I've got an interesting story on this, Jeremy. I was out with our crews here about two weeks ago and we had an undergrounding in a - replacement undergrounding in a subdivision area. So remember, in Michigan, subdivisions are underground. A lot of people request their service underground. And so we know how to do this work. And in fact, we have a large gas business that does a lot of undergrounding, and so we're sharing practices back and forth. And so, again, right now, we're starting out with the pilot. And that's just a nice way to step into this with the Public Service Commission to show them our capabilities in being able to deliver that at a low cost for our customers. Again, as I've shared in past calls, the cost for undergrounding in Michigan, given the soil, given where we intend to put the undergrounding, it's really conducive and it's really almost at parity with above-ground construction. So it makes it really affordable for our customers. And so we intend to use that practice, it's recognized through EPRI as a best practice; not everywhere, but strategically or selectively across our system. And so starts with 10 miles. We've got six counties identified. We've got projects starting up in one of the North of Grand Rapids area here in about two weeks. The Public Service Commission will be on that site as well to watch that, observe that. And what we intend to grow that is about 400 miles annually. As I've shared in the past, about 10% to 15% of our system is undergrounded. Other Midwest peers, around 35% to 40%. So again, it's best practice, and we see it as a way to improve reliability and resiliency for the future. As I shared in the Q1 call, our focus is clearly on reliability and resiliency coming off of the large ice storm. We are making a lot of investments, considerable investments across the electric system. And we've seen good performance here over the course of the summer. Even just the last night, we had 65-mile winds come through and the system performed well with about 20,000 customers out this morning and we're quickly restoring them. And so the investments we're making - it's a large system, but the investments we're making are certainly showing benefit. So we've got a great plan. We're filing that plan here in September with the five-year - with our five-year infrastructure plan. This audit that's underway that will start here in September will be another point of alignment for the right investments across the electric system to improve reliability and resiliency. So those things are going well and our system is performing well. And so I feel good about our performance this summer, and we'll continue to be focused on it. Thanks, Jeremy. Hi, Heidi. Well, first, I want to congratulate that peer utility that had an IRP settled this week. So congratulations to the DTE team. A lot goes into those IRPs.

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on the CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded.  [Operator Instructions] Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through May 4. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Sri Maddipati, Treasurer and Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nSri Maddipati: Thank you, Billy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. Now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our commitment to industry-leading financial performance spans two decades and it's this investment thesis that is foundational to our performance. Over that time, we've experienced changes in commissions, legislatures and governors, unplanned weather and storms, recession and a pandemic. In each and every year, we have delivered for our customers and for you, our investors. It's the -- it's the performance you have come to expect from a premium name like CMS Energy and this year is no different. We remain squarely focused on our mission at CMS Energy, making the needed investments in safety, reliability and decarbonization of our system, balanced by customer affordability and our $15.5 billion five-year customer investment plan. These investments in our expansive and aging electric and gas systems are critical to enhance reliability and resiliency and are supported by Michigan's constructive legislation and regulatory framework. Our investments are coupled with our lean operating system, the CE Way, which helps us manage and lower cost. This ongoing drive to see and eliminate waste is evident from the field to the office and helps improve our efficiency, ensuring we deliver customer value while keeping bills affordable. We are committed to this, and I believe we do it better than almost any company in the industry. As we round out the first quarter of 2023, I want to share a few highlights. First, Board's announcement of the Blue Oval Battery Park. This is another important win, which brings $3.5 billion, 2,500 jobs and adds to the growing list of economic development projects in our service territory. We saw additional enrollments in our voluntary green pricing program, supporting the build-out of our first large tranche of owned solar representing 309 megawatts and of a total 1,000 megawatt approved. Preparations continue for the acquisition and transition of the Covert generating facility scheduled for June as approved by our IRP. And in our gas business, we began construction of our mid-Michigan pipeline of $550 million, 56-mile pipeline to enhance deliverability and safety of our natural gas system. I want to be clear, at CMS Energy, year after year, regardless of conditions, we are positioned to deliver. Now let me address the extreme weather we faced in the first quarter. In late February and early March, we experienced the second largest storm event in our service territory. Our line crews are some of the most skilled and experienced in the business, and they showed up with able hands and parts of service and our customers were well served by their dedication. In addition to our crews in the field, there are hundreds of people behind the scenes to support our crews and our communities, including many of our coworkers, who volunteered to serve customers throughout the restoration. I know many of my coworkers join our earnings call. And from my heart, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for showing up for our customers and for each other. Because of our team, working together to serve, 97% of our customers were with power within three days. In our 135-year history, eight of the most destructive storms have occurred in the last 20 years. That's a significant data point. The severity and frequency of storms we're seeing highlights the need to enhance critical investment and amplify our efforts on the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system. We need more undergrounding. This is an area where we are significantly behind some of our Midwest peers. We also need to do more sectionalizing, automated transfer reclosures and looping and overall system hardening. These important investments are critical to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers and will be outlined in our pending electric rate case, and in our updated 5-year electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. We also plan to include an investment recovery mechanism in our upcoming rate case to add certainty to our investment. I'm pleased that our commission has been supportive of reliability improvements, doubling our efforts around tree trimming since 2020. This as well as other customer investments has contributed to the 20% improvement in our reliability in 2022, but there is more work to be done and more needed investment. We will continue to work productively with the commission and the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system, so we prepare for increasingly severe weather. We expect further alignment and collaboration and the needed investments in the upcoming storm audit as we work on a common goal of improving our distribution system for all customers. I'm confident in our ability to work with all stakeholders because Michigan has the legislative and regulatory framework in place to enable these investments and to attract the capital needed to drive the changes we all want to see. We have a productive energy law that provides forward-looking test years, constructive ROEs and supportive incentives. It is this environment, which has earned Michigan to rank as a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction for the past decade. Now I know many of you will want to dive into the details of the back and forth in both the regulatory and legislative arenas, which we are happy to do in Q&A., but remember, it's all part of the process. Let me remind you, we have a track record of working with all stakeholders to drive successful outcomes. It's why we settled three cases in 2022. Now I want to be clear where we stand today. We saw both unseasonably warm weather in January and February as well as significant cost with the ice storm. As you would expect, we've taken actions early to counteract that impact. Therefore, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Most importantly, our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence for the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. This isn't our first rodeo, whether it was the pandemic or weather-related, we managed the work to deliver for both customers and investors through the CE Way and other countermeasures already underway, we will offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I have confidence in our team and in our plan for 2023 and beyond, given our long-standing commitment and performance. At CMS Energy, we deliver for customers while consistently delivering industry-leading growth. Now I'll hand it over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, we delivered adjusted net income of $204 million or $0.70 per share, largely driven by unfavorable weather and costs related to service restoration as a result of the significant storm activity that Garrick noted earlier. To elaborate on the impact of weather on sales, given the well-publicized warm winter experienced in the Midwest, the number of heating degree days in our service territory during the quarter were approximately 18% below normal weather pattern. The atypically warm weather, coupled with a strong comp in the first quarter 2022 resulted in $0.27 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022, as noted on Slide 7. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.03 per share of negative variance as last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements were offset primarily by the roll-off of tax benefits realized in the first quarter of 2022 associated with the prior gas rate case settlement as expected. From a cost perspective, as mentioned, our financial performance in the first quarter was significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses attributable to storm restoration costs, which resulted in $0.20 per share of negative variance versus the first quarter of 2022. It is worth noting, however, that given the elevated storm costs we've seen over the last few years, we have incorporated fairly conservative assumptions for this cost category in our full year forecast. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022 due to the absence of strong sales at the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer. We anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief net of investment-related costs, which we have quantified at $0.17 per share versus the comparable period in 2022. Our underlying assumptions for rate relief are largely driven by last year's successful gas and electric rate case settlements, and we have assumed a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense to the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way. And in light of the weather-related headwinds in the first quarter, we have supplemented our planned productivity for the year by limiting hiring, reducing our use of consultants and contractors, accelerating longer-term IT cost reduction initiatives and eliminating other discretionary spending among other activities. These cost performance measures will support the $0.28 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that none of these actions will impact the safety and reliability of our electric and gas business. Lastly, as we discussed during our fourth quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share of pull-aheads achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 as per our original guidance. And to offer further risk mitigation of the financial headwinds encountered in the first quarter and provide additional contingency should we need it, we have supplemented these opportunities with anticipated cost savings at the parent largely in the form of opportunistic financings and tax planning, which in aggregate, we estimate will drive $0.36 to $0.42 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Before moving on, I'll just note that though our track record of delivering on our financial objectives over the last two weeks -- two decades speaks for itself, we remain perpetually paranoid in our financial planning process. More bluntly, we always do the worryings, so you don't have to. And to that end, I'm pleased to report that we've already begun to see the benefits of the numerous countermeasures implemented in the first quarter. As such, I'm highly confident that we will realize the balance of expected savings over the course of the year. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are largely limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has already been priced and/or funded over the past several months. As we have noted in the past, the parent's contribution of the funding needs of the Covert acquisition is in place with roughly $440 million of forward equity contract. This equity will be issued in connection with the acquisition of the facility and we have assumed the associated EPS dilution in our full year guidance. While we don't have any further required financing needs at the parent this year, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic financings to derisk our future funding needs if market conditions are accommodative. Our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the rest of the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. As you look at Slide 9, I'll remind you again, our track record spans two decades of consistent industry-leading results despite changing commissioners, legislatures and governors, recessions, severe weather and storm activity, or a pandemic. We're here for the long haul. We have powered Michigan's progress for nearly a century-and-a-half. And as we look ahead, we see great opportunities to support the state's growth through critical infrastructure as we help power Michigan through the next century. With that, Bailey, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Jeremy, your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Hi, good morning. And I just wanted to come back to the key focus, I think, in the market at this point, just with the adverse weather and storm headwinds in the first quarter. Great to see that you're still targeting high end of the guide there. And just wondering, as you think about contingency flex this year, I guess, if there is anything else that moves against you, do you have more contingency that could offset that if weather shapes up less than expected or anything else moves against plan?\nGarrick Rochow: I have confidence in our ability to deliver. That's the first point, Jeremy. And we know there's a lot of year remaining. And so really in all our efforts, we look to build contingency out throughout the year. And so maybe if I just take a step back because I know this is a popular question today and just talk about our playbook. Rejji alluded to it, but let me offer a little more specifics. And I'd break it into really five areas. The first one is we plan conservatively. And you know this, Jeremy. We've done this year after year after year. That's what leads to our consistency, one of the reasons we had consistent financial performance. And also, we talked about this in Q4. What we did in 2022 to derisk the year. And then just adding to Rejji's points, we budget for storms, and we buy it conservatively for storms because we know they occur throughout the year. And so in many cases, this is just a weather story. So the first piece is just we plan conservatively. The second piece of the plan is the CE Way. And you -- this is another strong suit for us. And I'll remind everybody, it's industrial engineering, and it's a lean operating system. It's science, it is proven throughout the years for many different companies. And I see a great opportunity that we continue to deliver on year after year. Scheduling optimization is one example underway right now. We're making capital IT investments to get other efficiency improvements. It improves customer satisfaction while reducing costs. Our run rate has typically been around $50 million a year, as you know, and there's a lot more muscle we have there. The third piece is really around the labor piece. And that is what you would expect. We released some consultants. Our contractors are flexible, so we dialed that down a bit. We pinched back on overtime and then we hold on hiring. And so those things help as well. The fourth area is really discretionary spending. It's limiting conferences and travel and some of the training. And you think that's small, but it's actually big when you apply it across the entire company. And then the fifth piece and Rejji hit on it was, good tax planning and just opportunistic financing. And so that's the recipe. And as I said, this isn't our first rodeo. If you go back to the pandemic, we had to find $100 million. 50% of it came through the CE Way, 50% through other actions, very similar to what we're doing right now. And so we're going to chin this bar, and we're going to add some contingency throughout the year. So I feel very confident in our ability to deliver and to weather whatever Mother Nature throws at us throughout the year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That's very helpful. And maybe pivoting -- maybe pivoting to the gas case. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about that. I know the gas case maybe doesn't come as much focus as electric generally speaking. But what are the key focus points across stakeholders in the gas case at this point? And just trying to get a sense for your thoughts on chances for a settlement without getting too far ahead of yourself.\nGarrick Rochow: First things first, this is a good and constructive starting point. If I was just to dissect it a little bit for you, what we saw from staff in the AG as far as ROE was better than previous staff and AG positions. And so that bodes well for an ROE and some of the financial metrics. The other important piece is we build that -- remember, we built that case over Q3 and Q4 last year. And so gas prices were rising. We also saw some expense from pension OPEB perspective, but when you fast forward to today, those have changed. And so gas prices are lower. We snapped the line at the end of the year on pension and OPEB expense. And so we got a $212 million ask, but that effectively pulls that down because the fact pattern is different than what we saw when we built the case. And then the big piece is that people are talking about here is the sales forecast. And there's about $10 million, $12 million difference there. And so let me walk through that. We have used this method since 2010 to project sales. It's a 15-year regression type model. We haven't changed a bit. It's tried and true and it's accurate. And here's the important point. Back in 2010, the commission ordered us, let me repeat, the commission ordered us to use this method. That was in case U15986. And so we're doing exactly what the commission told us to do. So we feel like really good about where we're positioned there. And so there's a lot of cats and dogs, but bottom line, take this away, it's a good constructive starting point. The other thing you asked about settlement, we'll always look for the opportunity for settlement, but again, we sit in a very constructive jurisdiction. So I'm very comfortable taking it to the end and getting it forward from the commission.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open. We will move on to our next question. Our next question today comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Good morning, team. Let me follow up on the first question here just around the uptick in usage, nonutility tax and other. You guys elaborated on it. So not only have you pressed some of those levers to see the quarter-over-quarter change in '23 and the range, right? You're talking about $0.36 to $0.42 of positive offsets there now, but in addition to that, you've got further levers to go to the extent in which they might materialize. I just want to make sure I understand the comment from earlier.\nRejji Hayes: Julien, this is Rejji. Yes, you've got it exactly right. And Garrick, I think, offered a wonderful dissertation on how we approach cost reduction opportunities. The only thing I would add to his comments is that when it comes to cost reduction, we don't discriminate. We look across the entire cost structure. When you exclude depreciation, it's about $7 billion annually and about $1 billion of that is a combination of interest expense and tax related spend, combination of federal, state income tax as well as property tax. And so we look across all of those cost categories to identify opportunities. And what you're seeing in that pronouncement bar in that waterfall are opportunities that we anticipate around potential prefunding. As you know, we aggressively look at the maturity profile of our bonds and see if there are opportunities to take out bonds prematurely. So we'll look at those. And then again, on the tax planning side, we're always looking for opportunities to reduce costs, whether that's for state tax, property tax or otherwise. And so that's what's incorporated into that last item. And again, that's all I would add to Garrick's good comments on how we approach cost reduction.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent. Fair enough. And then just following up on some of the conversation on regulatory mechanisms. You talked about including an investment regulatory mechanism in your upcoming case. Can you talk about what that looks like? And perhaps talk about that in parallel with some of this conversation on ring-fencing here? I mean how do you think about reincenting to isolate spending on specific subject areas? It sounds like this IRM might be related? And then Also, maybe you could talk about ring fencing in the context of veg management efforts.\nGarrick Rochow: Absolutely, Julien. And you've obviously listened to the Chair Scripps, he's used the word ring fencing around some of the capital investments. So the way we think about it is really, I put it in three buckets. And so the first bucket is really we know that in order to deliver reliability and resiliency for our customers, that's going to take more capital investment. It's just the nature of an aging systems with more severe weather. And so we're all focused on that. The Commission, we're certainly focused on a company. And so as every one of our coworkers here within CMS Energy and the broader Consumers Energy. So we're squarely focused on that first bucket. The second bucket really is what you brought up and that the Commission wants to be able to ring-fence it. And they're looking at a prudency, accountability. And typically, when we've asked for large increases, they want to know that we can do the work, and we have the resources to ramp up. And so that's an important piece. And this IRM, well, this tracking mechanism allows us to do that and provide the accountability that the Commission is looking to see. And so ultimately, that should lead to the third bucket, which is the recovery piece, which is helpful for investors. And so I see all those three working together. And in fact, I want to give you an example. Back in 2011, and I was engaged in 2011, we did a similar on our gas business. We're looking to increase the amount we spent on replacing mains and services. We started a new gas construction group. And the Commission and staff at the time were had questions about -- important questions about how you're going to do that and how are you going to ramp up resources. And so we did a similar type mechanism then, delivering improved safety for our customers, replacing mains and services, and creating that ring fence that accountability associated with the tracking mechanism. And we were very successful. It started out at $85 million back in 2011, and now it's a $250 million program on an annual basis. And so we're taking that same approach as we go through this case. Is that helpful, Julien?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes, absolutely. So perhaps let me just make sure I'm hearing you right. This would that help address some lag related considerations, perhaps shift timing of future cases? Or is this principally about accounting and accountability back to the commission to just make sure the dollars and cents are getting spent in the right bucket?\nGarrick Rochow: The latter is the main focus. And then -- I mean all the time, it could lead to extend out some rate cases. But our focus right now is just making sure there's the accountability piece and the ring fencing that -- that the Chair has referenced in some of his public comments.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. Excellent. And then on the veg management, just quickly, just with respect to that side of the equation, obviously, been a lot of focus on that front. Your commentary saying that you've increased it from 2020, helpful. Any further efforts in that regard? And obviously, there seems to be an acute desire or need for that. How do you think about allocating even more in that direction at this time?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. So just to give you some real numbers on this, so about in 2020, it was around $50 million on an annual basis. And with support of the Commission through different cases, we requested more to address this important aspect of reliability, we were up around $100 million on an annual basis. And there's a couple of components of it. And we're continuing to look at other opportunities to invest more in that. But we're also looking at the efficiency of that and so this is an area where we're using technology and artificial intelligence and analytics to be able to better predict where to utilize those dollars. And so we've -- our trees, trim per mile has actually improved over the time period as well. And so that's helpful in the conversations we have with the Commission, and then we'll continue to look for opportunities to look at other areas to invest and improve reliability, much like I said during my comments around the capital investments. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Julien, the only thing I would add is that when we think about the planning year and particularly years in which we have a little bit of upside or contingency, usually vegetation management is one of the first items that comes up on the Flex list. And last year, in fact, and we were -- had a little bit of upside that was weather driven. We did about $5 million or so of flex related to vegetation management. So our actuals, even though we've budgeted around $100 million as Garrick noted for last year, I think our actuals were closer to $105 million, certainly over $100 million. And so Flex is an opportunity for us to do additional vegetation management. And then remember, we have that voluntary refund mechanism, which is also a vehicle through which we can do incremental operating expenses. And so the current voluntary refund mechanism that we have outstanding, we've targeted about $8 million towards additional vegetation management this year out of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And as you know, we obviously pulled that lever in Q4 of last year for $22 million all in. And again, a portion of that will be allocated towards vegetation management, assuming we get Commission approval. So that's the other mechanism we have as well.\nOperator: Next question today is a follow-up question from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nShahriar Pourreza: Sorry if I missed this, but I just wanted to maybe just round out the storm discussion. I guess, do the storms -- do they -- will they lead to more resiliency spend? Is it going to increase CapEx? Or do you see offsets to CapEx? Are you going to sort of seek any kind of new mechanisms? I mean, some things are already in rider-like items. Would resiliency kind of get that similar treatment? I guess overall, just how do these storms kind of change your thoughts around the 5-year plan?\nGarrick Rochow: We share -- so just to be really crystal clear on this, there's going to be more capital investment that's needed to improve reliability and resiliency, and it's a reflection of an aging system with more severe weather. And I offered some of that in my prepared remarks, but in this next electric rate case, we're proposing IRM or investment recovery mechanism as a tracker to show and greater certainty around our capital investments. And so that's the intent. We know we have to invest more. There's a number of ways to do that. One is our on it and focusing on that and get alignment with the commission. The other is the rate case and then the other one is the five-year electric distribution investment plan. And so all of those different filings, all those different conversations lead to better alignment and better support for our electric distribution investments. And so the long term is yes in that. And this IRM mechanism, we believe, will create greater accountability with the commission. Chair Scripps has talked about ring-fencing and then ultimately should lead to more recovery of those capital investments. Is that helpful, Shar?\nShahriar Pourreza: Yes. And I guess the question is, should we be looking at these incremental investments as extending the runway of your growth or accretive to your growth?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, we have a long runway, and we invest -- we update our plan every year. But that 5-year plan includes about $6 billion of investments in the electric distribution system. That is up. That was up in this most recent plan. And we'll continue to look at as we model across the system as there's additional investments, we'll continue to look at opportunities to invest more there. There's a long runway of opportunity just given the nature of our system.\nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Got it. And then maybe just shifting to financing. Financing is -- it's been a bit of a tough headwind, but interest rates seem to have moderated year-to-date. I guess how are you trending versus the embedded interest cost and plan in terms of '23 and maybe even opportunities for some cushion versus '24 since rates have come down versus your original expectations?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, sure. This is Rejji. Great question. So as always, I think we had a word count of about 6x or 7x in our prepared remarks, where we talked about planning conservatively. And that has been the case here. And so in our plan, we had pretty conservative assumptions at the operating company, and that's where the vast majority of the issuances are this year. And we've been fortunate for the issuances we've done to date to issue those at levels -- interest rate levels below what we haven't planned. So we're seeing upside, and that's already flowing through our '23 numbers. And obviously, we'll benefit from that in '24 and beyond because we're issuing a long-dated paper. And so certainly, with interest rates moderating over the last several months, that creates additional opportunities, and that's what we'll be mindful of as we look at the final sort of six, seven months of the year and seeing if we can capitalize on the obviously, the accommodative capital markets that we're seeing right now.\nOperator: Next question today comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra from Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, guys. Just maybe on the -- just continuing the discussion along storms, can you update us on the investigation that was started by the commission? My understanding is that they were looking for a third-party consultant. So maybe just what's the latest there?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, broadly, from the storm audit perspective, so they started that last fall. And in the process of selecting the vendor right now or the firm right now, and we anticipate that to start in the September time frame. But I'll remind you the big picture perspective on the storm audit is that, we're both aligned. That being the Commission and CMS Energy aligned that we need to improve reliability. And so I really view this as an opportunity to be able to get further alignment on the needed investments in our system. I'll give you a great example of undergrounding. We want to do more undergrounding. And if we look at our Midwest peers, they're around 35%, 40% underground. We're at 10%. It goes back to Shar's question. Is there opportunities for investment? There's a lot of them. And so we see that as important. You can look at the EPRI, Electric Power Research Institute and they'll say undergrounding improves reliability, depending on if it's three phase or single phase by 50% to 90%. And so this is a great example where we need -- with the storm model, we can utilize this to get better alignment on immediate investments in the system. And once we have that alignment, then again, we can move forward and get greater certainty around those investments. Does that help, Durgesh?\nDurgesh Chopra: It absolutely does. But you don't -- I guess the point is, I know you've said this before, you don't see anything punitive coming out of those audits as a result as they kind of go through your processes and other things and fast practices?\nGarrick Rochow: I don't see anything punitive. No.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Okay. And then just one quick follow-up. I know this is small, but you've got a decision on the voluntary refund mechanism earlier in the month. And I believe there were some disallowances. Can you talk to that and discuss that briefly?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. I'll tag team with Rejji. Just the context around this. These are pretty small dollars. And the bottom line, we have this option to file a voluntary refund mechanism. And we did that in 2022, the dollars are booked in 2022, but it's not a cake walk, like it's not assured that you're going to get approval, staff and the commissioners have a say in that, right? And they really telegraph the importance of incremental forestry and some other things with our customers in terms of helping out those low-income customers. And so they've really given us another opportunity at the bat, and we filed that here on April 21 to reflect the commissioners and staff comments. And so I feel good about getting to a positive outcome on that and it's just navigating kind of the back and forth of the process, Durgesh.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. That's the essence of it, Durgesh. Just to give you some specifics on the numbers. So when we filed the VRM in late 2022 it was for $22 million, $5 million of which was to support our vulnerable customers in the gas side of the business. That was fully approved by the commission and where there was some, I'd say, counseling guidance by the commission was on the balance of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And to Garrick's comments, they wanted to see direct customer benefits. And so that's why we have recently, as of last Friday, requested service -- sorry, additional forestry or vegetation management as well as additional support for vulnerable customers. So that's how it's cut. Just that $17 million is subject to further approval and we're confident that we'll get this recent request over the finish line.\nOperator: Next question today comes from the line of David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDavid Arcaro: Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Let's see, there's been some legislative bills drafted in the state with some more aggressive net zero targets. I was wondering if that might impact any of your thinking around the next time you address the IRP?\nGarrick Rochow: Great question. Let me -- I think perspective is really important here because often in Lansing, just part of bill. There's a lot of back and forth, and there's media releases and then you just got to kind of clear the air and talk about it from a big picture perspective. And so I'll remind our listeners here that in the governor's first term, she introduced a healthy climate plan. And in fact, one of the members on my direct staff was one of the stakeholders in that process and was involved in the review and kind of the language around it. And then I participated with a group of about eight to 10 CEOs and the governor in the review process. And so that -- the governor's called the climate plan lines up really well with where we're headed from a state perspective, but also lines up well with our current IRP and the like. Now the legislature has -- the Senate specifically, has introduced some new builds that are a little bit more aggressive, but I want to remind everybody, this is the back and forth of Lansing. And that's the first starting point. That's the first valley you might say. And so we're going to continue to navigate that and move forward with that and manage that process. Ultimately, at the end of the day, if it requires something -- for us to do something sooner, we'll do that sooner. And that will mean more capital investment opportunities. But I want to let everyone know it's really manageable and, again, well aligned with where we're already headed.\nDavid Arcaro: Got you. That's helpful. And could you also touch on just what you're seeing in terms of weather normal volumes -- sales volumes and how that's lining up with your expectations so far?\nRejji Hayes: David, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Yes, weather normalized trends, I will admit we were scratching our heads a little bit at the trends that we saw. And just for everyone's benefit, we saw residential about 2.5 -- a little over 2.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Commercial, a little over 3.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Industrial was flat excluding one large low-margin customer. And then total was down about a little over 2.5% versus Q1 of last year. And I would say it's really early days. We are still digging into the data. I would just start by saying, as hard as our sales forecasting team works, weather normalized math is a combination of art and science. And when you see, I'd say, dramatic weather like we saw in Q1 of last year, where it was extremely cold and then a pretty warm winter as we noted earlier, Q1 of this year. You can see a good degree of imprecision in those calculations. And so I say all that to say, we're looking at it with a little bit of a skeptical eye because the reality is we're still seeing very strong economic indicators in the service territory. Our customer count specifically for commercial, we're up almost 0.5% -- over 0.5% to almost one point across the electric and gas businesses residential customer counts are still up. And while we have built into our guidance, that continued return to work, we're still seeing a good level of really not every company in Michigan at this point has four, five days in the office. And so we still think as we get into the summer months, we may see some of that favorable mix we've seen in the past. And so I would say early days, there's probably a little bit of noise in the data. And I'll just say on the industrial side, we were flat again versus where we were last year, but we couldn't have a more robust economic development pipeline borne out of a lot of the constructive federal legislation that's been passed over the 18 months. And we continue to look at our trends versus pre-pandemic and across every customer class we're doing as well, if not better, than what we were doing pre-pandemic, particularly when you take into account our energy efficiency programs, which effectively reduced our load year-over-year by 2%. And so again, I don't think what you're seeing in Q1 and then the data is indicative of the economic conditions in Michigan. I think it's just more a weather-normalized math versus anything else.\nOperator: Next question today SP1 Come from the line of Michael Sullivan from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael Sullivan: You guys answered a lot here. I just had a couple of small follow-ups on what's already been discussed. So just on the undergrounding, can you maybe just give us a sense on what the long-term target is there? How much of the system you are looking underground and over what period of time you'd like to get there?\nGarrick Rochow: Great question. And it's important to recognize we're not trying to underground the entire system, and it's really about selective or sometimes I've used the word strategic undergrounding. And again, we know from EPRI research across a number of utilities, you're in a 50% to 90% improvement, whether it's three phase or a single phase. And so ideally, we're trying to get to a point where we can do 400 miles a year. And then really over a 10-year period, kind of increment that up. So I would say the range of around 10,000 miles is really what we're trying to get to overall. It's not going to occur overnight, but that does provide a nice opportunity to enhance the reliability and resilience of our system and provide a nice opportunity from a capital investment standpoint.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Very helpful. And then kind of a similar question just following up on the IRM. I think the context you gave on the gas side was helpful in terms of where it started and where it's gotten to. Can you maybe frame that on the electric side? And I know you haven't officially filed the next case yet, but just kind of where that could start and ultimately go?\nGarrick Rochow: So we're being very thoughtful about our starting point, and we see it as an opportunity to grow from there. But our first valley will be in the $100 million range for an IRM and then we'll grow it from there.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Weisel: Let me first say congratulations again for selling EnerBank. I'm very glad we're not spending 3/4 of the call talking about that.\nGarrick Rochow: I'm glad too. Thank you.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes. First question, just a follow-up on undergrounding. So you talked about the 50% to 90% operational improvement estimate from EPRI. Do you give a rough sense rule of thumb, the cost difference versus traditional above ground streaming is what a breakeven might look like?\nGarrick Rochow: So what are the things -- we're doing some -- we've done a lot of -- I shouldn't say a lot, but we're doing a lot of work with our undergrounding crews right now. And that price for undergrounding, particularly on a single phase, is approaching the price of overhead. It's not quite there yet, but close. And so we're in the range on single phase maybe like $250,000 a mile for undergrounding. Again, it's directional bore. And give or take, it depends on the conditions of the soil and homes and other things, but that's roughly the number. And so they're really quite comparable or growing comparable in terms of that price point. And so again, we've got pretty fertile soils. We have pretty soft soils. And so we're not in rock and some of those things, which helps from a cost perspective.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Andrew, the only thing I would add to Garrick's Eric's comments, when you think -- the only thing I would add to Garrick's comments, when you think about the cost benefit and the potential opportunity, if you look at the last few years of our vegetation management plus our service restoration, we're spending on average based on actual is about $200-plus million per year across those two cost categories. And so the opportunity would be over time with those investments in underground and to potentially reduce that overall cost bucket. And so that's how we would think about the cost benefit in addition to some of the points Garrick raised earlier.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Great. Next one, are you able to tell what's the deferred fuel cost balances now versus at year-end?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I'll take a stab at that, Andrew, and we can follow up with more precision on off-line, if needed. Where we ended the year, we had -- well, goodness into 2022, just over $800 million across our supply costs in the electric side on the gas inventories on the gas side of the business. So call it about a $450 million, $400-ish million split, to $850 million. We started to chip away at that. Obviously, we have very strong cost recovery mechanisms in Michigan, which have been kind of tried and true since the mid-'80s. And so we do expect on the gas side to recover the vast majority of that over the course of this fiscal year. And then for electric, we did apply a bit of elegance to a recovery process for power supply cost. And so of the $450 million we had coming due in January, we filed with the commission a plan to recover that over a 3-year span. So effectively $150 million per year through 2025. And just given the current environment, we thought that, that was the right thing to do to alleviate the cost burden for customers. And we also thought our balance sheet could accommodate it as well. And it's also the way we've structured it, just the fact that we're no longer going to be recovering those costs through working capital now through a regulatory asset, it's actually credit accretive based on how Moody's calculates these -- their FFO. And so for a variety of reasons, it was a nice opportunity, and we've exercised it in the first quarter.\nAndrew Weisel: Very good. One quick follow-up, if I may. Holtec, I know there's not a whole lot new for you to announce, but can you just give an updated thought on the timing of potential updates there with the state versus the timing of your next IRP, which I believe is likely to come next year.\nGarrick Rochow: So we do know -- I mean, it's public information that Holtec, who is responsible for decommissioning the facility and has the operating rights there in the facility, has requested federal funding. They've also requested state funding within this budget, which is being worked right now, state budget. So that will be figured out in this May, June, July time frame. They've asked $300 million in the state budget. Again, this is public information. What I would expect to see from this is a lower cost for power. We've had Palisades, it's been expensive PPA when we expect it to be lower given all the tax dollars that are applied there. And that power should flow into Michigan. So those are important components of it. So we expect low-cost power, as I've said historically, and we're open to consider a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism, but at this point, we've got a good IRP in place. And if that comes to fruition, it will shape our next IRP. But it's really too soon to tell on how it would shape upcoming IRPs.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. I guess the more specific question was, would the timing of your IRP potentially be influenced by the timing of Palisades resolution?\nGarrick Rochow: That's too hard to tell. And frankly, this bringing a nuclear plant back as -- to my knowledge, has not been done. And so there's a lot of hurdles and a lot of unknowns there. I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot of unknowns. And so it's difficult to say whether it will have an impact or not on our next IRP.\nOperator: Next question today comes from the line of Alex Mortimer from Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlex Mortimer: Thank you very much. So given that everyone in the industry is kind of always walking the tightrope between reliability and then customer bill impact, can you provide sort of any thoughts on what the tone of the commission has been with regards to the undergrounding? Is this something that that they've suggested or something you're sort of bringing to them unprompted?\nGarrick Rochow: There's been a lot of conversations and there will continue to be more conversations on this important work of undergrounding. We'll be doing some additional piloting within the context of this proposed electric rate case, and then we'll continue to look at other opportunities to build out on that. But going back to the storm model, this is really our opportunity to get further alignment with the Commission on the important investments that need to be made to improve reliability and resiliency. And I would suggest that both the Commission, staff and the company and all our coworkers here, too, are really well aligned on ensuring that we're improving reliability and resiliency. You talked about the affordability piece as well. And that's clearly top of mind. Part of that is we leverage the CE Way, not only to improve our operations and maintenance expense, but we utilize it to improve capital efficiency. So that dollar goes further. Just like I shared earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to bring the cost down of undergrounding and frankly, of all our capital work.\nAlex Mortimer: Understood. And then just a little bit more color on sort of the time line of what this would look at or what this would look like and then potentially the dollar amount of upside to the CapEx plan? And then should we think of this as getting you kind of into the high 7s towards 8 of your long-term guidance? Or is this more of extending the 7% out beyond sort of where it is currently?\nGarrick Rochow: So when we introduced in Q4 call, we introduced our $15.5 billion capital investment plan. And that had more electric distribution and electric related spend in that plan was like $6.1 billion of that, which was an increase. We're not changing our capital plan at this point because we increased it just here in the last call. That may change over time because we look at that capital plan every year. And as I've shared, there's a long runway of opportunity there. And so as we get certainty around these investments, as we build out that 5-year electric distribution plan, that will be an opportunity to look at the longer-term capital piece. Now going back to the growth piece. 6% to 8%, we said confidence toward the high end, and that puts it in that range of 7% to 8%. Historically, I've said this, I'll say it again, there are no sugar highs, and we go for consistency year after year. And so that's we compound of access. That's the quality of earnings that we aim for and we will continue to repeat year after year, because we know that's what our investors value.\nAlex Mortimer: Congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: The next question today comes from the line of Ross Fowler from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRoss Fowler: So just a couple for me here. One, the first part is just any commentary on commissioner resignation and time line for replacement cost replacement. And then not to beat the dead horse here, but you came into the year on my quick math is about $75 million of cost contingency to offset the sort of weather normalization you knew you were going to have to deal with? Now Garrick, as you went through those five things, you've priced that up to about $200 million and around numbers. So there's another $125 million or so coming in. And clearly, you thought about wanting that bucket is onetime and what's sort of more permanent. Maybe can you contextualize for us how conversations with the Commission have gone around what onetime cost improvement, what's permitting improvement in the past? And kind of look to the future as to how those negotiations go because clearly, there can be some conversation around that as you look at the cost reduction?\nGarrick Rochow: Let me start with Germain Phillips. And it was -- I have great respect for Germain. He was a great commissioner, and we saw constructive outcomes. And he left the legacy at the Commission, and I'd put it into three areas. One, he really moved electric vehicles in the state. And it was forward-thinking and progressive about that work. And then in addition to that, there was a lot of work and grid monetization and optimization of the grid that he helped position within the commission. And the third piece, and this is -- have really played out nicely over the course of the pandemic is he was laser-focused on low income and vulnerable customers. And I give him credit as well as the Commission for the work. We have the lowest bad debt levels across the industry. And so we've taken care of our low-income customers during some of the toughest times during this pandemic. And so much of that credit goes to Germain Philips. But I'll also refer you to -- he's got a public statement out there. He's successful, but so is his wife is successful. And his wife has went after new opportunities, and so many thanks, and congratulations to both Germain, his wife and his family as they pursue different career opportunities. This Commission has functioned well in the past with two commissioners. And we've got two constructive, experienced commissioners in place. And so I'm not worried about the interim at all. And if you look historically as well as with this governor, Governor Whitmer here, they've been very thoughtful about the placement of commissioners and found experience and well-suited commissioners to continue the constructive environment, regulatory environment in Michigan. We do know that the governor is out -- the governor's staff is out looking for a new commissioner. That process is underway, but we don't have a deadline or a date out there and when that will take place. But again, I have confidence in our governor to continue the long-standing tradition of this jurisdiction in a constructive jurisdiction. I'm going to pass the call over to Rejji here to talk a little bit about the financial information to your second part of your question.\nRejji Hayes: Ross, I appreciate the question. So just one last thing on Germain, and it's a bit of an advertisement for the Michigan legislative and regulatory construct. I mean, part of the reason why it's really wonderful to have staggered terms for your commissioners is because when you do have turnover on an unexpected basis, you still have that continuity of leadership and so we obviously have Chair Scripps and Commissioner Paratek still in the seat. And they obviously have a policy -- or there are philosophies are aligned with the governor's policies, I should say, around healthy climate. And so there's that nice continuity there, and they have a quorum with 2. And so we'll still carry on, and I'm sure they'll find a suitable replacement for Commissioner Phillips when the time is right. With respect to your question around the cost opportunities, let me just be very clear, I'll try to get at the numbers you specified as best I can. And if I miss anything, please feel free to follow up with a question. But if you think about our guidance at the beginning of the year on our Q4 call, we effectively said, as always, we plan for normal weather. And we assume the level of cost productivity in our plan. And so we were showing about $0.04 per share of positive variance related to cost savings. And then we had some estimated opportunities as a result of the warm weather we put to work in 2022 in Q4 specifically with the voluntary refund mechanism and some of the pull aheads and opportunities we exercise in the context of the electric rate case settlement. And so that equated to about $0.19 to $0.25 on of opportunity or positive variance in the original guidance. And so as you fast forward to Q1 and you look at the waterfall we're showing today, what's really changed is that we've now seen $0.21 or just over $80 million pretax in the form of weather hurt and that's what we're offsetting and solving for in the form of cost productivity as well as in that sort of catch-all bucket around parent-related opportunities. And so what we're effectively saying is that $80 million of offsets that we need to go identify and when we look at our track record, and we're not trying to be modest around that, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that. And so when you think about 2020 during the pandemic, we took out $100 million. And when you think about sustainable savings versus one-timers, about 50% of that in 2020 was in the form of the CE Way, and that's what will flow through rates. And that's what customers will benefit from. There are one-timers that sometimes we do have to resurrect some of those old plays. And so those are sort of opportunities that probably don't get incorporated into rates because you need to execute on those in subsequent years. But my working assumption is we'll see probably about a good portion of the opportunities we're trying to execute on and offset this $0.20 or $0.20-plus of weather in the form of CE Way as well as those opportunities Garrick noted earlier in the call. So whether it's hiring freezes, whether it's external hiring type decisions around contractors and consultants, we will take all of those opportunities as part of this portfolio savings to offset that, call it, $80-plus million of weather. So that's how we think about it. That's how we'll go get it. And again, a good portion should be passed on to customers, but some will be onetimers and those are the ones that you don't necessarily repeat. Is that helpful?\nRoss Fowler: Yes, that's helpful, Rejji. I guess in the past, you've been able to have that discussion with the Commission. It's really onetime and what's permanent. In the context of any debate around that, right? As you look at some of that CE Way money and then some of the sort of hiring freeze stuff. I guess the risk from my perspective is the Commission would say, well, you have a bunch of onetime stuff in there and some of that permanent, can we get some customer bill relief out of that more permanent basis. But maybe contextualize that risk around discussions you've had about that in the past and their understanding of what's onetime and what's not.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. To be clear, this is the benefit of filing annual cases because as we realize those savings, which, again, when they're generated the CE Way, they are sustainable, we will pass them on in subsequent cases or as part of the adjudicated process. Because when we file rebuttal, we start to bake in some of those savings midstream. And so there is a pretty transparent dialogue with the commission staff and other interveners about the opportunities we think are sustainable, and that's what we incorporate into our cases. And again, that's the benefit of being an annual filer.\nRoss Fowler: Fantastic. So I'm with you on the $80 million in cost cuts and then there's like an incremental $50 million between the sort of year-end call back in this deck and that other usage category kind of went through in the answer to Julien's question.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. The only other thing I'll mention, just to be clear, there is a bit of geography, you have to be mindful of as well. So when we say parent-related savings, whether they're tax planning or financing efficiency, some of that is at the holding company, in which case, it wouldn't be incorporated into an adjudicated process because they're not at the opco level. So some of those will directly go to shareholders. And so I think that's also very clear to the commission and other stakeholders in the context of a rate case.\nOperator: There are no additional questions noted at this time. So I'd like to pass the call back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Bailey. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of 2023, we delivered adjusted net income of $204 million or $0.70 per share, largely driven by unfavorable weather and costs related to service restoration as a result of the significant storm activity that Garrick noted earlier. To elaborate on the impact of weather on sales, given the well-publicized warm winter experienced in the Midwest, the number of heating degree days in our service territory during the quarter were approximately 18% below normal weather pattern. The atypically warm weather, coupled with a strong comp in the first quarter 2022 resulted in $0.27 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022, as noted on Slide 7. Rate relief, net of investment-related expenses, resulted in $0.03 per share of negative variance as last year's constructive electric and gas rate case settlements were offset primarily by the roll-off of tax benefits realized in the first quarter of 2022 associated with the prior gas rate case settlement as expected. From a cost perspective, as mentioned, our financial performance in the first quarter was significantly impacted by higher operating and maintenance or O&M expenses attributable to storm restoration costs, which resulted in $0.20 per share of negative variance versus the first quarter of 2022. It is worth noting, however, that given the elevated storm costs we've seen over the last few years, we have incorporated fairly conservative assumptions for this cost category in our full year forecast. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of negative variance versus the comparable period in 2022 due to the absence of strong sales at the electric utility driven by last year's warm summer. We anticipate that the estimated negative variance attributable to weather will be more than offset by rate relief net of investment-related costs, which we have quantified at $0.17 per share versus the comparable period in 2022. Our underlying assumptions for rate relief are largely driven by last year's successful gas and electric rate case settlements, and we have assumed a constructive outcome in our pending gas rate case. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q4 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense to the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way. And in light of the weather-related headwinds in the first quarter, we have supplemented our planned productivity for the year by limiting hiring, reducing our use of consultants and contractors, accelerating longer-term IT cost reduction initiatives and eliminating other discretionary spending among other activities. These cost performance measures will support the $0.28 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that none of these actions will impact the safety and reliability of our electric and gas business. Lastly, as we discussed during our fourth quarter call, we're assuming modest growth at NorthStar and the benefits associated with the roughly $0.12 per share of pull-aheads achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 as per our original guidance. And to offer further risk mitigation of the financial headwinds encountered in the first quarter and provide additional contingency should we need it, we have supplemented these opportunities with anticipated cost savings at the parent largely in the form of opportunistic financings and tax planning, which in aggregate, we estimate will drive $0.36 to $0.42 per share positive variance versus the comparable period in 2022. Before moving on, I'll just note that though our track record of delivering on our financial objectives over the last two weeks -- two decades speaks for itself, we remain perpetually paranoid in our financial planning process. More bluntly, we always do the worryings, so you don't have to. And to that end, I'm pleased to report that we've already begun to see the benefits of the numerous countermeasures implemented in the first quarter. As such, I'm highly confident that we will realize the balance of expected savings over the course of the year. Moving on to the financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2023, which are largely limited to debt issuances at the utility, a good portion of which has already been priced and/or funded over the past several months. As we have noted in the past, the parent's contribution of the funding needs of the Covert acquisition is in place with roughly $440 million of forward equity contract. This equity will be issued in connection with the acquisition of the facility and we have assumed the associated EPS dilution in our full year guidance. While we don't have any further required financing needs at the parent this year, we will continue to evaluate opportunistic financings to derisk our future funding needs if market conditions are accommodative. Our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the rest of the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances, to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Julien, this is Rejji. Yes, you've got it exactly right. And Garrick, I think, offered a wonderful dissertation on how we approach cost reduction opportunities. The only thing I would add to his comments is that when it comes to cost reduction, we don't discriminate. We look across the entire cost structure. When you exclude depreciation, it's about $7 billion annually and about $1 billion of that is a combination of interest expense and tax related spend, combination of federal, state income tax as well as property tax. And so we look across all of those cost categories to identify opportunities. And what you're seeing in that pronouncement bar in that waterfall are opportunities that we anticipate around potential prefunding. As you know, we aggressively look at the maturity profile of our bonds and see if there are opportunities to take out bonds prematurely. So we'll look at those. And then again, on the tax planning side, we're always looking for opportunities to reduce costs, whether that's for state tax, property tax or otherwise. And so that's what's incorporated into that last item. And again, that's all I would add to Garrick's good comments on how we approach cost reduction. Yes, Julien, the only thing I would add is that when we think about the planning year and particularly years in which we have a little bit of upside or contingency, usually vegetation management is one of the first items that comes up on the Flex list. And last year, in fact, and we were -- had a little bit of upside that was weather driven. We did about $5 million or so of flex related to vegetation management. So our actuals, even though we've budgeted around $100 million as Garrick noted for last year, I think our actuals were closer to $105 million, certainly over $100 million. And so Flex is an opportunity for us to do additional vegetation management. And then remember, we have that voluntary refund mechanism, which is also a vehicle through which we can do incremental operating expenses. And so the current voluntary refund mechanism that we have outstanding, we've targeted about $8 million towards additional vegetation management this year out of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And as you know, we obviously pulled that lever in Q4 of last year for $22 million all in. And again, a portion of that will be allocated towards vegetation management, assuming we get Commission approval. So that's the other mechanism we have as well. Yes, sure. This is Rejji. Great question. So as always, I think we had a word count of about 6x or 7x in our prepared remarks, where we talked about planning conservatively. And that has been the case here. And so in our plan, we had pretty conservative assumptions at the operating company, and that's where the vast majority of the issuances are this year. And we've been fortunate for the issuances we've done to date to issue those at levels -- interest rate levels below what we haven't planned. So we're seeing upside, and that's already flowing through our '23 numbers. And obviously, we'll benefit from that in '24 and beyond because we're issuing a long-dated paper. And so certainly, with interest rates moderating over the last several months, that creates additional opportunities, and that's what we'll be mindful of as we look at the final sort of six, seven months of the year and seeing if we can capitalize on the obviously, the accommodative capital markets that we're seeing right now. Yes. That's the essence of it, Durgesh. Just to give you some specifics on the numbers. So when we filed the VRM in late 2022 it was for $22 million, $5 million of which was to support our vulnerable customers in the gas side of the business. That was fully approved by the commission and where there was some, I'd say, counseling guidance by the commission was on the balance of the $17 million that we allocated to the electric business. And to Garrick's comments, they wanted to see direct customer benefits. And so that's why we have recently, as of last Friday, requested service -- sorry, additional forestry or vegetation management as well as additional support for vulnerable customers. So that's how it's cut. Just that $17 million is subject to further approval and we're confident that we'll get this recent request over the finish line. David, this is Rejji. Appreciate the question. Yes, weather normalized trends, I will admit we were scratching our heads a little bit at the trends that we saw. And just for everyone's benefit, we saw residential about 2.5 -- a little over 2.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Commercial, a little over 3.5% off versus Q1 of 2022. Industrial was flat excluding one large low-margin customer. And then total was down about a little over 2.5% versus Q1 of last year. And I would say it's really early days. We are still digging into the data. I would just start by saying, as hard as our sales forecasting team works, weather normalized math is a combination of art and science. And when you see, I'd say, dramatic weather like we saw in Q1 of last year, where it was extremely cold and then a pretty warm winter as we noted earlier, Q1 of this year. You can see a good degree of imprecision in those calculations. And so I say all that to say, we're looking at it with a little bit of a skeptical eye because the reality is we're still seeing very strong economic indicators in the service territory. Our customer count specifically for commercial, we're up almost 0.5% -- over 0.5% to almost one point across the electric and gas businesses residential customer counts are still up. And while we have built into our guidance, that continued return to work, we're still seeing a good level of really not every company in Michigan at this point has four, five days in the office. And so we still think as we get into the summer months, we may see some of that favorable mix we've seen in the past. And so I would say early days, there's probably a little bit of noise in the data. And I'll just say on the industrial side, we were flat again versus where we were last year, but we couldn't have a more robust economic development pipeline borne out of a lot of the constructive federal legislation that's been passed over the 18 months. And we continue to look at our trends versus pre-pandemic and across every customer class we're doing as well, if not better, than what we were doing pre-pandemic, particularly when you take into account our energy efficiency programs, which effectively reduced our load year-over-year by 2%. And so again, I don't think what you're seeing in Q1 and then the data is indicative of the economic conditions in Michigan. I think it's just more a weather-normalized math versus anything else. Yes, Andrew, the only thing I would add to Garrick's Eric's comments, when you think -- the only thing I would add to Garrick's comments, when you think about the cost benefit and the potential opportunity, if you look at the last few years of our vegetation management plus our service restoration, we're spending on average based on actual is about $200-plus million per year across those two cost categories. And so the opportunity would be over time with those investments in underground and to potentially reduce that overall cost bucket. And so that's how we would think about the cost benefit in addition to some of the points Garrick raised earlier. Yes, I'll take a stab at that, Andrew, and we can follow up with more precision on off-line, if needed. Where we ended the year, we had -- well, goodness into 2022, just over $800 million across our supply costs in the electric side on the gas inventories on the gas side of the business. So call it about a $450 million, $400-ish million split, to $850 million. We started to chip away at that. Obviously, we have very strong cost recovery mechanisms in Michigan, which have been kind of tried and true since the mid-'80s. And so we do expect on the gas side to recover the vast majority of that over the course of this fiscal year. And then for electric, we did apply a bit of elegance to a recovery process for power supply cost. And so of the $450 million we had coming due in January, we filed with the commission a plan to recover that over a 3-year span. So effectively $150 million per year through 2025. And just given the current environment, we thought that, that was the right thing to do to alleviate the cost burden for customers. And we also thought our balance sheet could accommodate it as well. And it's also the way we've structured it, just the fact that we're no longer going to be recovering those costs through working capital now through a regulatory asset, it's actually credit accretive based on how Moody's calculates these -- their FFO. And so for a variety of reasons, it was a nice opportunity, and we've exercised it in the first quarter. Ross, I appreciate the question. So just one last thing on Germain, and it's a bit of an advertisement for the Michigan legislative and regulatory construct. I mean, part of the reason why it's really wonderful to have staggered terms for your commissioners is because when you do have turnover on an unexpected basis, you still have that continuity of leadership and so we obviously have Chair Scripps and Commissioner Paratek still in the seat. And they obviously have a policy -- or there are philosophies are aligned with the governor's policies, I should say, around healthy climate. And so there's that nice continuity there, and they have a quorum with 2. And so we'll still carry on, and I'm sure they'll find a suitable replacement for Commissioner Phillips when the time is right. With respect to your question around the cost opportunities, let me just be very clear, I'll try to get at the numbers you specified as best I can. And if I miss anything, please feel free to follow up with a question. But if you think about our guidance at the beginning of the year on our Q4 call, we effectively said, as always, we plan for normal weather. And we assume the level of cost productivity in our plan. And so we were showing about $0.04 per share of positive variance related to cost savings. And then we had some estimated opportunities as a result of the warm weather we put to work in 2022 in Q4 specifically with the voluntary refund mechanism and some of the pull aheads and opportunities we exercise in the context of the electric rate case settlement. And so that equated to about $0.19 to $0.25 on of opportunity or positive variance in the original guidance. And so as you fast forward to Q1 and you look at the waterfall we're showing today, what's really changed is that we've now seen $0.21 or just over $80 million pretax in the form of weather hurt and that's what we're offsetting and solving for in the form of cost productivity as well as in that sort of catch-all bucket around parent-related opportunities. And so what we're effectively saying is that $80 million of offsets that we need to go identify and when we look at our track record, and we're not trying to be modest around that, we feel very good about our ability to achieve that. And so when you think about 2020 during the pandemic, we took out $100 million. And when you think about sustainable savings versus one-timers, about 50% of that in 2020 was in the form of the CE Way, and that's what will flow through rates. And that's what customers will benefit from. There are one-timers that sometimes we do have to resurrect some of those old plays. And so those are sort of opportunities that probably don't get incorporated into rates because you need to execute on those in subsequent years. But my working assumption is we'll see probably about a good portion of the opportunities we're trying to execute on and offset this $0.20 or $0.20-plus of weather in the form of CE Way as well as those opportunities Garrick noted earlier in the call. So whether it's hiring freezes, whether it's external hiring type decisions around contractors and consultants, we will take all of those opportunities as part of this portfolio savings to offset that, call it, $80-plus million of weather. So that's how we think about it. That's how we'll go get it. And again, a good portion should be passed on to customers, but some will be onetimers and those are the ones that you don't necessarily repeat. Is that helpful? Yes. To be clear, this is the benefit of filing annual cases because as we realize those savings, which, again, when they're generated the CE Way, they are sustainable, we will pass them on in subsequent cases or as part of the adjudicated process. Because when we file rebuttal, we start to bake in some of those savings midstream. And so there is a pretty transparent dialogue with the commission staff and other interveners about the opportunities we think are sustainable, and that's what we incorporate into our cases. And again, that's the benefit of being an annual filer. Yes. The only other thing I'll mention, just to be clear, there is a bit of geography, you have to be mindful of as well. So when we say parent-related savings, whether they're tax planning or financing efficiency, some of that is at the holding company, in which case, it wouldn't be incorporated into an adjudicated process because they're not at the opco level. So some of those will directly go to shareholders. And so I think that's also very clear to the commission and other stakeholders in the context of a rate case."

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Sri, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our commitment to industry-leading financial performance spans two decades and it's this investment thesis that is foundational to our performance. Over that time, we've experienced changes in commissions, legislatures and governors, unplanned weather and storms, recession and a pandemic. In each and every year, we have delivered for our customers and for you, our investors. It's the -- it's the performance you have come to expect from a premium name like CMS Energy and this year is no different. We remain squarely focused on our mission at CMS Energy, making the needed investments in safety, reliability and decarbonization of our system, balanced by customer affordability and our $15.5 billion five-year customer investment plan. These investments in our expansive and aging electric and gas systems are critical to enhance reliability and resiliency and are supported by Michigan's constructive legislation and regulatory framework. Our investments are coupled with our lean operating system, the CE Way, which helps us manage and lower cost. This ongoing drive to see and eliminate waste is evident from the field to the office and helps improve our efficiency, ensuring we deliver customer value while keeping bills affordable. We are committed to this, and I believe we do it better than almost any company in the industry. As we round out the first quarter of 2023, I want to share a few highlights. First, Board's announcement of the Blue Oval Battery Park. This is another important win, which brings $3.5 billion, 2,500 jobs and adds to the growing list of economic development projects in our service territory. We saw additional enrollments in our voluntary green pricing program, supporting the build-out of our first large tranche of owned solar representing 309 megawatts and of a total 1,000 megawatt approved. Preparations continue for the acquisition and transition of the Covert generating facility scheduled for June as approved by our IRP. And in our gas business, we began construction of our mid-Michigan pipeline of $550 million, 56-mile pipeline to enhance deliverability and safety of our natural gas system. I want to be clear, at CMS Energy, year after year, regardless of conditions, we are positioned to deliver. Now let me address the extreme weather we faced in the first quarter. In late February and early March, we experienced the second largest storm event in our service territory. Our line crews are some of the most skilled and experienced in the business, and they showed up with able hands and parts of service and our customers were well served by their dedication. In addition to our crews in the field, there are hundreds of people behind the scenes to support our crews and our communities, including many of our coworkers, who volunteered to serve customers throughout the restoration. I know many of my coworkers join our earnings call. And from my heart, I want to say thank you to each and every one of you for showing up for our customers and for each other. Because of our team, working together to serve, 97% of our customers were with power within three days. In our 135-year history, eight of the most destructive storms have occurred in the last 20 years. That's a significant data point. The severity and frequency of storms we're seeing highlights the need to enhance critical investment and amplify our efforts on the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system. We need more undergrounding. This is an area where we are significantly behind some of our Midwest peers. We also need to do more sectionalizing, automated transfer reclosures and looping and overall system hardening. These important investments are critical to improve reliability and resiliency for our customers and will be outlined in our pending electric rate case, and in our updated 5-year electric distribution infrastructure investment plan. We also plan to include an investment recovery mechanism in our upcoming rate case to add certainty to our investment. I'm pleased that our commission has been supportive of reliability improvements, doubling our efforts around tree trimming since 2020. This as well as other customer investments has contributed to the 20% improvement in our reliability in 2022, but there is more work to be done and more needed investment. We will continue to work productively with the commission and the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution system, so we prepare for increasingly severe weather. We expect further alignment and collaboration and the needed investments in the upcoming storm audit as we work on a common goal of improving our distribution system for all customers. I'm confident in our ability to work with all stakeholders because Michigan has the legislative and regulatory framework in place to enable these investments and to attract the capital needed to drive the changes we all want to see. We have a productive energy law that provides forward-looking test years, constructive ROEs and supportive incentives. It is this environment, which has earned Michigan to rank as a top-tier regulatory jurisdiction for the past decade. Now I know many of you will want to dive into the details of the back and forth in both the regulatory and legislative arenas, which we are happy to do in Q&A., but remember, it's all part of the process. Let me remind you, we have a track record of working with all stakeholders to drive successful outcomes. It's why we settled three cases in 2022. Now I want to be clear where we stand today. We saw both unseasonably warm weather in January and February as well as significant cost with the ice storm. As you would expect, we've taken actions early to counteract that impact. Therefore, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Most importantly, our full year guidance of $3.06 to $3.12 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.70. We're also reaffirming our long-term adjusted earnings growth of 6% to 8% per year with continued confidence for the high end and remain committed to annual dividend per share growth of 6% to 8%. This isn't our first rodeo, whether it was the pandemic or weather-related, we managed the work to deliver for both customers and investors through the CE Way and other countermeasures already underway, we will offset the unplanned headwinds experienced early in the year. I have confidence in our team and in our plan for 2023 and beyond, given our long-standing commitment and performance. At CMS Energy, we deliver for customers while consistently delivering industry-leading growth. Now I'll hand it over to Rejji to provide some additional details and insights. Thank you, Rejji. As you look at Slide 9, I'll remind you again, our track record spans two decades of consistent industry-leading results despite changing commissioners, legislatures and governors, recessions, severe weather and storm activity, or a pandemic. We're here for the long haul. We have powered Michigan's progress for nearly a century-and-a-half. And as we look ahead, we see great opportunities to support the state's growth through critical infrastructure as we help power Michigan through the next century. With that, Bailey, please open the lines for Q&A. I have confidence in our ability to deliver. That's the first point, Jeremy. And we know there's a lot of year remaining. And so really in all our efforts, we look to build contingency out throughout the year. And so maybe if I just take a step back because I know this is a popular question today and just talk about our playbook. Rejji alluded to it, but let me offer a little more specifics. And I'd break it into really five areas. The first one is we plan conservatively. And you know this, Jeremy. We've done this year after year after year. That's what leads to our consistency, one of the reasons we had consistent financial performance. And also, we talked about this in Q4. What we did in 2022 to derisk the year. And then just adding to Rejji's points, we budget for storms, and we buy it conservatively for storms because we know they occur throughout the year. And so in many cases, this is just a weather story. So the first piece is just we plan conservatively. The second piece of the plan is the CE Way. And you -- this is another strong suit for us. And I'll remind everybody, it's industrial engineering, and it's a lean operating system. It's science, it is proven throughout the years for many different companies. And I see a great opportunity that we continue to deliver on year after year. Scheduling optimization is one example underway right now. We're making capital IT investments to get other efficiency improvements. It improves customer satisfaction while reducing costs. Our run rate has typically been around $50 million a year, as you know, and there's a lot more muscle we have there. The third piece is really around the labor piece. And that is what you would expect. We released some consultants. Our contractors are flexible, so we dialed that down a bit. We pinched back on overtime and then we hold on hiring. And so those things help as well. The fourth area is really discretionary spending. It's limiting conferences and travel and some of the training. And you think that's small, but it's actually big when you apply it across the entire company. And then the fifth piece and Rejji hit on it was, good tax planning and just opportunistic financing. And so that's the recipe. And as I said, this isn't our first rodeo. If you go back to the pandemic, we had to find $100 million. 50% of it came through the CE Way, 50% through other actions, very similar to what we're doing right now. And so we're going to chin this bar, and we're going to add some contingency throughout the year. So I feel very confident in our ability to deliver and to weather whatever Mother Nature throws at us throughout the year. First things first, this is a good and constructive starting point. If I was just to dissect it a little bit for you, what we saw from staff in the AG as far as ROE was better than previous staff and AG positions. And so that bodes well for an ROE and some of the financial metrics. The other important piece is we build that -- remember, we built that case over Q3 and Q4 last year. And so gas prices were rising. We also saw some expense from pension OPEB perspective, but when you fast forward to today, those have changed. And so gas prices are lower. We snapped the line at the end of the year on pension and OPEB expense. And so we got a $212 million ask, but that effectively pulls that down because the fact pattern is different than what we saw when we built the case. And then the big piece is that people are talking about here is the sales forecast. And there's about $10 million, $12 million difference there. And so let me walk through that. We have used this method since 2010 to project sales. It's a 15-year regression type model. We haven't changed a bit. It's tried and true and it's accurate. And here's the important point. Back in 2010, the commission ordered us, let me repeat, the commission ordered us to use this method. That was in case U15986. And so we're doing exactly what the commission told us to do. So we feel like really good about where we're positioned there. And so there's a lot of cats and dogs, but bottom line, take this away, it's a good constructive starting point. The other thing you asked about settlement, we'll always look for the opportunity for settlement, but again, we sit in a very constructive jurisdiction. So I'm very comfortable taking it to the end and getting it forward from the commission. Absolutely, Julien. And you've obviously listened to the Chair Scripps, he's used the word ring fencing around some of the capital investments. So the way we think about it is really, I put it in three buckets. And so the first bucket is really we know that in order to deliver reliability and resiliency for our customers, that's going to take more capital investment. It's just the nature of an aging systems with more severe weather. And so we're all focused on that. The Commission, we're certainly focused on a company. And so as every one of our coworkers here within CMS Energy and the broader Consumers Energy. So we're squarely focused on that first bucket. The second bucket really is what you brought up and that the Commission wants to be able to ring-fence it. And they're looking at a prudency, accountability. And typically, when we've asked for large increases, they want to know that we can do the work, and we have the resources to ramp up. And so that's an important piece. And this IRM, well, this tracking mechanism allows us to do that and provide the accountability that the Commission is looking to see. And so ultimately, that should lead to the third bucket, which is the recovery piece, which is helpful for investors. And so I see all those three working together. And in fact, I want to give you an example. Back in 2011, and I was engaged in 2011, we did a similar on our gas business. We're looking to increase the amount we spent on replacing mains and services. We started a new gas construction group. And the Commission and staff at the time were had questions about -- important questions about how you're going to do that and how are you going to ramp up resources. And so we did a similar type mechanism then, delivering improved safety for our customers, replacing mains and services, and creating that ring fence that accountability associated with the tracking mechanism. And we were very successful. It started out at $85 million back in 2011, and now it's a $250 million program on an annual basis. And so we're taking that same approach as we go through this case. Is that helpful, Julien? The latter is the main focus. And then -- I mean all the time, it could lead to extend out some rate cases. But our focus right now is just making sure there's the accountability piece and the ring fencing that -- that the Chair has referenced in some of his public comments. Yes. So just to give you some real numbers on this, so about in 2020, it was around $50 million on an annual basis. And with support of the Commission through different cases, we requested more to address this important aspect of reliability, we were up around $100 million on an annual basis. And there's a couple of components of it. And we're continuing to look at other opportunities to invest more in that. But we're also looking at the efficiency of that and so this is an area where we're using technology and artificial intelligence and analytics to be able to better predict where to utilize those dollars. And so we've -- our trees, trim per mile has actually improved over the time period as well. And so that's helpful in the conversations we have with the Commission, and then we'll continue to look for opportunities to look at other areas to invest and improve reliability, much like I said during my comments around the capital investments. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well. We share -- so just to be really crystal clear on this, there's going to be more capital investment that's needed to improve reliability and resiliency, and it's a reflection of an aging system with more severe weather. And I offered some of that in my prepared remarks, but in this next electric rate case, we're proposing IRM or investment recovery mechanism as a tracker to show and greater certainty around our capital investments. And so that's the intent. We know we have to invest more. There's a number of ways to do that. One is our on it and focusing on that and get alignment with the commission. The other is the rate case and then the other one is the five-year electric distribution investment plan. And so all of those different filings, all those different conversations lead to better alignment and better support for our electric distribution investments. And so the long term is yes in that. And this IRM mechanism, we believe, will create greater accountability with the commission. Chair Scripps has talked about ring-fencing and then ultimately should lead to more recovery of those capital investments. Is that helpful, Shar? Well, we have a long runway, and we invest -- we update our plan every year. But that 5-year plan includes about $6 billion of investments in the electric distribution system. That is up. That was up in this most recent plan. And we'll continue to look at as we model across the system as there's additional investments, we'll continue to look at opportunities to invest more there. There's a long runway of opportunity just given the nature of our system. Yes, broadly, from the storm audit perspective, so they started that last fall. And in the process of selecting the vendor right now or the firm right now, and we anticipate that to start in the September time frame. But I'll remind you the big picture perspective on the storm audit is that, we're both aligned. That being the Commission and CMS Energy aligned that we need to improve reliability. And so I really view this as an opportunity to be able to get further alignment on the needed investments in our system. I'll give you a great example of undergrounding. We want to do more undergrounding. And if we look at our Midwest peers, they're around 35%, 40% underground. We're at 10%. It goes back to Shar's question. Is there opportunities for investment? There's a lot of them. And so we see that as important. You can look at the EPRI, Electric Power Research Institute and they'll say undergrounding improves reliability, depending on if it's three phase or single phase by 50% to 90%. And so this is a great example where we need -- with the storm model, we can utilize this to get better alignment on immediate investments in the system. And once we have that alignment, then again, we can move forward and get greater certainty around those investments. Does that help, Durgesh? I don't see anything punitive. No. Yes. I'll tag team with Rejji. Just the context around this. These are pretty small dollars. And the bottom line, we have this option to file a voluntary refund mechanism. And we did that in 2022, the dollars are booked in 2022, but it's not a cake walk, like it's not assured that you're going to get approval, staff and the commissioners have a say in that, right? And they really telegraph the importance of incremental forestry and some other things with our customers in terms of helping out those low-income customers. And so they've really given us another opportunity at the bat, and we filed that here on April 21 to reflect the commissioners and staff comments. And so I feel good about getting to a positive outcome on that and it's just navigating kind of the back and forth of the process, Durgesh. Great question. Let me -- I think perspective is really important here because often in Lansing, just part of bill. There's a lot of back and forth, and there's media releases and then you just got to kind of clear the air and talk about it from a big picture perspective. And so I'll remind our listeners here that in the governor's first term, she introduced a healthy climate plan. And in fact, one of the members on my direct staff was one of the stakeholders in that process and was involved in the review and kind of the language around it. And then I participated with a group of about eight to 10 CEOs and the governor in the review process. And so that -- the governor's called the climate plan lines up really well with where we're headed from a state perspective, but also lines up well with our current IRP and the like. Now the legislature has -- the Senate specifically, has introduced some new builds that are a little bit more aggressive, but I want to remind everybody, this is the back and forth of Lansing. And that's the first starting point. That's the first valley you might say. And so we're going to continue to navigate that and move forward with that and manage that process. Ultimately, at the end of the day, if it requires something -- for us to do something sooner, we'll do that sooner. And that will mean more capital investment opportunities. But I want to let everyone know it's really manageable and, again, well aligned with where we're already headed. Great question. And it's important to recognize we're not trying to underground the entire system, and it's really about selective or sometimes I've used the word strategic undergrounding. And again, we know from EPRI research across a number of utilities, you're in a 50% to 90% improvement, whether it's three phase or a single phase. And so ideally, we're trying to get to a point where we can do 400 miles a year. And then really over a 10-year period, kind of increment that up. So I would say the range of around 10,000 miles is really what we're trying to get to overall. It's not going to occur overnight, but that does provide a nice opportunity to enhance the reliability and resilience of our system and provide a nice opportunity from a capital investment standpoint. So we're being very thoughtful about our starting point, and we see it as an opportunity to grow from there. But our first valley will be in the $100 million range for an IRM and then we'll grow it from there. I'm glad too. Thank you. So what are the things -- we're doing some -- we've done a lot of -- I shouldn't say a lot, but we're doing a lot of work with our undergrounding crews right now. And that price for undergrounding, particularly on a single phase, is approaching the price of overhead. It's not quite there yet, but close. And so we're in the range on single phase maybe like $250,000 a mile for undergrounding. Again, it's directional bore. And give or take, it depends on the conditions of the soil and homes and other things, but that's roughly the number. And so they're really quite comparable or growing comparable in terms of that price point. And so again, we've got pretty fertile soils. We have pretty soft soils. And so we're not in rock and some of those things, which helps from a cost perspective. So we do know -- I mean, it's public information that Holtec, who is responsible for decommissioning the facility and has the operating rights there in the facility, has requested federal funding. They've also requested state funding within this budget, which is being worked right now, state budget. So that will be figured out in this May, June, July time frame. They've asked $300 million in the state budget. Again, this is public information. What I would expect to see from this is a lower cost for power. We've had Palisades, it's been expensive PPA when we expect it to be lower given all the tax dollars that are applied there. And that power should flow into Michigan. So those are important components of it. So we expect low-cost power, as I've said historically, and we're open to consider a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism, but at this point, we've got a good IRP in place. And if that comes to fruition, it will shape our next IRP. But it's really too soon to tell on how it would shape upcoming IRPs. That's too hard to tell. And frankly, this bringing a nuclear plant back as -- to my knowledge, has not been done. And so there's a lot of hurdles and a lot of unknowns there. I'm not saying it can't happen, but there's just a lot of unknowns. And so it's difficult to say whether it will have an impact or not on our next IRP. There's been a lot of conversations and there will continue to be more conversations on this important work of undergrounding. We'll be doing some additional piloting within the context of this proposed electric rate case, and then we'll continue to look at other opportunities to build out on that. But going back to the storm model, this is really our opportunity to get further alignment with the Commission on the important investments that need to be made to improve reliability and resiliency. And I would suggest that both the Commission, staff and the company and all our coworkers here, too, are really well aligned on ensuring that we're improving reliability and resiliency. You talked about the affordability piece as well. And that's clearly top of mind. Part of that is we leverage the CE Way, not only to improve our operations and maintenance expense, but we utilize it to improve capital efficiency. So that dollar goes further. Just like I shared earlier, we continue to look at opportunities to bring the cost down of undergrounding and frankly, of all our capital work. So when we introduced in Q4 call, we introduced our $15.5 billion capital investment plan. And that had more electric distribution and electric related spend in that plan was like $6.1 billion of that, which was an increase. We're not changing our capital plan at this point because we increased it just here in the last call. That may change over time because we look at that capital plan every year. And as I've shared, there's a long runway of opportunity there. And so as we get certainty around these investments, as we build out that 5-year electric distribution plan, that will be an opportunity to look at the longer-term capital piece. Now going back to the growth piece. 6% to 8%, we said confidence toward the high end, and that puts it in that range of 7% to 8%. Historically, I've said this, I'll say it again, there are no sugar highs, and we go for consistency year after year. And so that's we compound of access. That's the quality of earnings that we aim for and we will continue to repeat year after year, because we know that's what our investors value. Let me start with Germain Phillips. And it was -- I have great respect for Germain. He was a great commissioner, and we saw constructive outcomes. And he left the legacy at the Commission, and I'd put it into three areas. One, he really moved electric vehicles in the state. And it was forward-thinking and progressive about that work. And then in addition to that, there was a lot of work and grid monetization and optimization of the grid that he helped position within the commission. And the third piece, and this is -- have really played out nicely over the course of the pandemic is he was laser-focused on low income and vulnerable customers. And I give him credit as well as the Commission for the work. We have the lowest bad debt levels across the industry. And so we've taken care of our low-income customers during some of the toughest times during this pandemic. And so much of that credit goes to Germain Philips. But I'll also refer you to -- he's got a public statement out there. He's successful, but so is his wife is successful. And his wife has went after new opportunities, and so many thanks, and congratulations to both Germain, his wife and his family as they pursue different career opportunities. This Commission has functioned well in the past with two commissioners. And we've got two constructive, experienced commissioners in place. And so I'm not worried about the interim at all. And if you look historically as well as with this governor, Governor Whitmer here, they've been very thoughtful about the placement of commissioners and found experience and well-suited commissioners to continue the constructive environment, regulatory environment in Michigan. We do know that the governor is out -- the governor's staff is out looking for a new commissioner. That process is underway, but we don't have a deadline or a date out there and when that will take place. But again, I have confidence in our governor to continue the long-standing tradition of this jurisdiction in a constructive jurisdiction. I'm going to pass the call over to Rejji here to talk a little bit about the financial information to your second part of your question. Thanks, Bailey. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. We'll see you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. After the presentation, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through November 7. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJason Shore: Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now, I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. At CMS Energy, we deliver year-over-year for all stakeholders. We do that through our investment thesis. This is simple but powerful model coupled with our disciplined execution sets us apart in the industry and has delivered more than two decades of industry-leading financial performance. Typically, I walk through that investment thesis. But today, I want to offer three differentiators at CMS Energy providing confidence and visibility as we continue to strengthen and lengthen our 6% to 8% EPS growth. First, Michigan's clean energy law. This law is great for our customers, the planet, and our investors. It ensures we have the right legislation in place to move from coal to clean, providing certainty for the investments we need to make in renewable energy and it gives us the flexibility to either own the assets or utilize a power purchase agreement doing what is best for our customers. Now, here's what's unique. Earning a financial compensation mechanism approximately 9% on a power purchase agreement, no other state that I'm aware of has this provision and then add to it requirements for battery storage and an increased incentive on energy efficiency. There is a lot in this law, very little of which is in our five-year investment plan, providing a strong tailwind and we believe we can do this important work affordably for our customers. The flexibility in the law that allows for ownership or power purchase agreements both within Michigan and outside of Michigan provides more options for customers and ensures we can utilize lower cost energy. Furthermore, it provides us the ability to replace existing, outdated, and above market power purchase agreements with new renewable assets, which keeps costs affordable for customers. Our 20-year renewable energy plan or REP that we'll file next month will detail our clean energy investments and plans to achieve the targets set by Michigan's clean energy law. This filing will show the renewable assets needed above and beyond our 2021 integrated resource plan as well as the additional renewable assets needed to meet increasing sales demand and growth in the state. As I shared before, Michigan's clean energy law is great for all stakeholders. It provides the flexibility we need to find the most cost effective clean energy for our customers. The second item I want to highlight is our commitment to customer reliability. I'm very proud of the comprehensive plan we have laid out in our five-year $7 billion electric reliability roadmap. This plan details our actions to move to second quartile reliability performance or SAIDI by the end of the decade through targeted investments in our electric grid, needed investments for our customers because we have recorded some of Michigan's highest wind speeds over the last five years. We are seeing more frequent storm activity. This plan is deliberate and comprehensive and improves reliability in the short-term and built in long-term resiliency and it does it proactively versus reactively. This plan means we will begin serious efforts to underground more of our distribution wires, better align with Midwest peers, and replace more than 20,000 poles with those designed for more extreme weather. It also means investing in grid technology for more automation and machine learning to speed up restoration in weather events. We're also one of the first utilities East of the Mississippi is file a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan, which lays out the investments needed to prepare for climate change. These customer investments are based on Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI best practices and will bolster our distribution system to a level of performance our customers expect, particularly as the economy continues to electrify. And our plans have been supported. I am pleased with the recent outcomes from the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Liberty storm audit, which highlights the vastness of our system, the billions of dollars and decades needed to improve it and the importance of these strategic investments. And our customary benefit when we improve the system proactively versus reactively, making these investments in the system now means we can do it at a 40% to 70% lower cost compared to when we do this work following an outage. Better service, lower customer cost, this is a great story. The third point I want to make today is the nice tailwind of economic development we are seeing in our service area. I'm excited and encouraged about the true renaissance underway in Michigan. The big story across the industry is sales growth brought by data centers. We're seeing the same and we're happy to talk more about data centers. Our story is different and in my opinion, better. In Michigan, we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance bolstered by onshoring, unique state attributes, and the inflation reduction and the CHIPS and Science Act. And we love manufacturing growth because it brings jobs, supply chains, commercial activity, housing starts and residential growth where there is greater benefit for the state. We recently updated this slide to highlight several new and diversified examples. Corning expanding and investing up to $900 million and bringing nearly 1,100 jobs to the state, this is the sort of growth we like to see significant Michigan investment in job growth. Saab has expansion plans for an integration and assembly facility. Saab is new to the state but adding to the nearly 4,000 businesses engaged in defense and aerospace work in Michigan. Two new examples among many that speak to the diversified manufacturing growth we are realizing over 700 megawatts of signed contracts in 24 months and growing. Our economic development pipeline continues to look promising with over 6 gigawatts of load looking to either move to or expand in our state, 60% of which is manufacturing. As I mentioned earlier, our renewable energy plan will conservatively reflect our updated load growth forecast based on the strong economic development tailwind we are experiencing. We work hard every day to win our customers business and we are honored when businesses see the value in investing in our state and our service territory. So let's take a look at the regulatory calendar for the year. As I shared last quarter, our financial related regulatory outcomes are known for the year given the constructive March electric rate order in the approved gas rate case settlement. This positions us well as we navigate the last quarter of 2024. Gas rates were effective October 1 and we plan to file our next gas rate case in December of this year. In our current electric rate case, we saw a constructive starting position by staff. We saw support for further underground, wildfire mitigation, and the continuation of the investment recovery mechanism. I do want to point out that the mechanism for storm recovery and the investments outlined in the electric rate case and in the Liberty storm audit are important for our customers. That probably goes without saying. However, it may require that we go to a fully adjudicated order to get the best outcome for our customers. Know that we are confident with where we are in the process, the quality of our filing, and the proactive nature of the investments we are making to improve reliability for our customers. If we go the full distance, we expect the order in March of 2025. Now, let's spend a moment on the results. For the first nine months, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up $0.41 versus the same period in 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. Given our confidence in the year, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including this year's guidance range of $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. We are initiating our full year guidance for 2025 at $3.52 to $3.58 per share, reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range. And we are well-positioned, just like 2024, to be toward the high end of that range. It is important to remember that we always rebase guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call, compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. And like we've done in previous years, we'll provide a refresh of our five-year capital and financial plans on the Q4 call. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 9, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first nine months of 2024 and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2023 both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $736 million or $2.47 per share, which compares favorably to the first nine months of 2023, largely due to higher rate relief, net of investment costs, and solid performance at Northstar. From a weather perspective, the third quarter offered favorable weather versus the prior year to the tune of $0.10 per share, largely due to a warm September. The strong third quarter weather for the electric business more than offset the mild weather experience in the first half of the year, thus equating to $0.05 per share of positive variance year-to-date. As mentioned, rate relief net of investment costs, one of the key drivers of our year-to-date performance resulted in $0.18 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved on our electric rate order received in March and the residual benefits of last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our year-to-date financial performance was largely driven by lower service restoration expense despite a sizable weather system that impacted our service territory in early August. Our favorable variance in this regard has been fueled in large part by cost efficiencies in our storm response efforts. In fact, even though our volume of outages has increased by approximately 10% in 2024 versus the comparable period last year, our restoration cost per interruption has decreased by over 10%, all while restoring customers at a faster rate than the prior year. These achievements and our storm response efforts are just another example of our lean operating system, the CE Way, driving daily productivity in the business. Quite simply, our workforce uses the tools of the lean operating system to deliver more value to customers with less resources every day. That is the essence of the CE Way, and this favorability and service restoration expense coupled with cost performance throughout the business provided $0.02 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note the $0.16 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch all bucket in the middle of the chart; the primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at Northstar and a tax related benefit, among other factors. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of positive variance for the remaining three months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the last three months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.09 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which went into effect on October 1, as Garrick noted. On the cost side, we anticipate $0.15 per share of negative variance for the remaining three months of 2024; in large part due to additional funding support for select cost categories that have trended above budgeted levels for the majority of the year, such as insurance premium and IT-related expenses. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from last year and conservative assumptions around non-utility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.25 to $0.31 per share of negative variance. In summary, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $3.29 per share to $3.35 per share with a continued bias toward the high end. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 10, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. We continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings as per long-standing guidance from the rating agencies. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan on Slide 11. I'm pleased to report that we've completed all of our planned financings for the year at levels favorable to plan and ahead of schedule, which leaves us with ample liquidity for the remainder of the year and beyond. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financings at the utility given the need to rebalance the rate-making capital structure in accordance with the recent regulatory outcomes and attractive pricing at issuance. It is also worth noting that we remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy over two decades of consistent industry-leading financial performance. We remain confident in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: Thanks very much, Garrick. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nShar Pourreza: Hey guys, good morning. A - Garrick Rochow Hey, good morning, Shar. I heard you didn\u2019t like our hold music. I heard that was a thing today.\nShar Pourreza: Oh, God, it was on hold, no matter, but it's okay.\nGarrick Rochow: Hey, I like your choices. Yes, Metallica, but you don't have AC/DC. If you would have brought a little AC/DC, I'd have been there. What's your question today? There you go. There you go.\nShar Pourreza: So just, Garrick, on the data center demand, obviously, everyone is mentioning it to kind of the degree, Michigan has obviously started to emerge as a favorable data center environment with some of the hyperscalers doing some land acquisitions there, Grand Rapids to be exact. Do you have sort of existing grid capacity to onboard kind of the new customers with that kind of an interconnection lag? What are you seeing on the ground? And do you need sort of a new tariff structure to move ahead? We've seen some interesting proposals coming out of Ohio, a lot of back and forth there. So a big question, but how do you think about those?\nGarrick Rochow: Michigan in our service territory, specifically you referenced Grand Rapids and that's been our service territory, is a great place for data centers and investment in Michigan. The temperate climate, the fiber infrastructure and to your point and really the point of your question here is we have the electric infrastructure to be able to serve. And so we work closely with data centers and other manufacturing customers to meet their timelines for the ramp-up and load. And so that makes us advantageous to locate a data center or as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, really manufacturing, there's been a lot of manufacturing growth that's shown up here. And so that's what's exciting about Michigan. I guess, the other thing is, too, when they look to our clean energy law, they can see a path to that growing clean energy, the renewables and then the clean energy standard by 2040, which is also attractive to the data center components. But I would highlight, too, just what I don't want to lose in this conversation is manufacturing growth. That's really where we've seen the true renaissance. We've seen a lot of opportunities show up there that will show up in our renewable energy plan as well, to serve our customers. And from my -- just going to the question on the tariff, you'll recall, we've already filed ex-parte type filing to move the data centers to what we call our GPD rate. That's a better reflection of the cost to serve, and we are working collaboratively with the commission to see if another rate structure is needed for data centers that would ensure our residential customers are not left subsidizing data centers.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Any timing on that, Garrick?\nGarrick Rochow: We would expect that we continue to make progress. I mean, like I said, the ex-parte filing has already been approved. And so we're in a good position there from a cost of service perspective. We'll continue to work with the commission. I would expect that to take place over the next six months to a year.\nShar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. And then just lastly, in terms of your takeaways from the storm and resiliency audits this year. Is your commitment to cutting outages supported by the current distribution plan? Or would you look to update the DSP to incorporate some recommendations from the audit? Or does it just inform you better to move the $1.5 billion incremental CapEx you're identified into base plan? Thanks.\nGarrick Rochow: This -- this audit that was completed -- we call it the Liberty audit because that was the company that was performing the work is really balanced and supportive. I mean, you could see that in the context of the support of the work that we need to do, the capital investments and free trimming to be able to continue to enhance reliability and provide better service and as in my prepared remarks, share, we can do that at a lower cost. So better service, lower cost when we do things proactively versus reactively, and so we have our five-year capital plan, that $7 billion plan that's comprehensive and very deliberate and focus. And we'll take the Liberty audit results, and we'll look to incorporate that in that plan. And I'll remind you, that's a $7 billion plan; $5.5 billion of it is incorporated into the capital plan. And so there's opportunity there to work more of that capital in, of course, with the support of the Public Service Commission staff and commission.\nShar Pourreza: Fantastic. Thank you, guys so much. Remember, Garrick, Guns N' Roses next time. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nGarrick Rochow: AC/DC. AC/DC.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Tonet: Thank for taking my questions here. Just wanted to start off, if you could walk us through a bit more, I guess, on DIG, given everything that we're seeing on the generation site needs their capacity needs. Just with contracts rolling off and how you think about, I guess, the trajectory there going forward?\nGarrick Rochow: NorthStar business, and I'll get to the big piece, continues to perform well. But frankly, I'd expect that. It's a small piece of the earnings mix. But they need to perform, and we expect them to perform, and that's exactly what they're doing, both from an operational and a financial perspective. And of course, DIG is an important part of that mix or Dearborn Industrial Generation. And we continue to see strength both in the capacity markets and the energy markets, and we are securing those bilateral contracts throughout time, and they continue to be above our plan and our expectations. And so it's a great story, and we continue to be a tailwind in our overall expectations around 6% to 8% EPS growth.\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, this is Rejji. All I would add is we've been -- Jeremy, just to provide a bit more of a financial lens to Garrick's good comments. As you know, we've had a good 25% to 30% open margin in the outer years of our plan. And so we'll provide an update on our Q4 call, as we always do around the levels at which we're pricing capacity contracts in that bilateral market. And as you know, we'll bring in a new year in our next five-year plan, and that will have even more open margin. And we continue to see reverse inquiry at levels well in excess of what we've historically realized from a capacity price perspective. And so we're usually around $3 to $3.50 per kilowatt month. We're now seeing 5 and 6 handles in reverse increase. So still a really robust opportunity. And unsurprisingly, it's just because of the real nice tactical we're seeing with just supply being reduced in Zone 7 through retirements and upward pressure on the demand curve. So we don't see any reason why that should abate anytime soon.\nGarrick Rochow: And one thing I'll remind you, Jeremy, too, it's not linear as well. We do have outages to maintain the system out there. So that's an important piece to remember, particularly as we go through the long-term plan.\nJeremy Tonet: Right. That makes sense. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself there. But maybe just thinking about growth in general, we're seeing some of your peers talk about higher sales forecast and even some kind of lifting the expected long-term EPS CAGR expectation. And just wondering how you guys think about this given the incremental opportunities you see in front of you. I'm expecting strengthening and lengthening but just wanted to double check there.\nGarrick Rochow: Let me offer some comments, and I'm sure Rejji is going to want to jump into this as well. And we provided those differentiators, those tailwinds to give visibility and to instill confidence. And that's what we have. We have confidence about the ability to strengthen and lengthen that 6% to 8% EPS growth. But I want to be clear, what our investors expect is that we continue to deliver year after years. That's 21 years; we've now industry-leading or consistent industry-leading financial performance, time and time again. And then compounding off actuals, which gives you a better quality of earnings, that's what our investors inspect, that's what we expect and that's what we deliver. And so by providing some insights to those tailwinds, I just -- you get some idea of the momentum and how we can again strengthen our confidence in delivering this and just doing it year after year, exactly what our investors expect. But certainly, Rejji, I'm sure we want to walk in and offer some commentary on this as well.\nRejji Hayes: Jeremy, all I would add to Garrick's comments is that when you think about the components of what will drive long-term growth, Garrick walked through in great detail in his prepared remarks, the opportunities on the capital side, whether it's through the capital investments and/or earning on PPAs in the context of new energy law, and that's going to be decades of financial opportunity, investment in PPAs again, the opportunities to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution, infrastructure that's decades of spend and investment opportunity to the benefit of customers and investors. And then in the gas business, which we didn't talk about as much on this call, but there's still a significant level of investment to be made to continue to harden that system, reduce future methane emissions and continue to keep it safe in the lab, particularly with pending regs coming out from FEMSA. And so a lot of investment opportunity and when the upward pressure that you alluded to on the demand side that will create the headroom among other benefits to facilitate and enable that investment to come to fruition. And so we see a really nice glide path to deliver on that differentiated 6% to 8% growth for many years, compounding off of actuals. And so we're not going to get ahead of our Q4 disclosure, and that's when we update our five-year plan, but we still feel very good about our ability to strengthen and lengthen that growth to Garrick's comments.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. That makes sense. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today will be from the line of Ross Fowler with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nRoss Fowler: Good morning, Garrick. Good morning, Rejji. How are you?\nGarrick Rochow: Good morning, Ross.\nRoss Fowler: Congratulations on the quarter, another solid one as we've all come to expect from CMS. So just a couple of questions. I think you've talked about the 2.5 gigawatts of storage target in the state. How do you think about -- could that change is sort of battery tax credit shift? Or does the cost of that change? Or is there just a lot of support for this at the state level versus what's going on at the federal level potentially after next week, how do you contextualize that's investment going forward?\nGarrick Rochow: Let me offer the two mechanisms that we have to consider what I'd call supply type assets. One is the renewable energy plan, which we'll file here November 15 in that range around that date. And that will lay out some of the renewable energy assets we need, both -- it will build off the foundation of our 2021 integrated resource plan, but then there's two tranches as I see it of additional renewable energy, that will show up in the terms of meeting the 50% standard of renewable assets for 2030 as well as 60% for 2035. That's really tranche one. And then there was additional renewable assets as a result of economic development and growth, the demand growth that we've seen. So that's a nice piece of work, a nice tailwind. There will be some reference to storage in there as part of that. But where more of the storage will play out is in our 2026 integrated resource plan. That's where we look at the capacity mix. That's where we look at the reliability of supply. That's where we'll look at those important components. In the degree, there's additional tax incentives or benefit that will play out in that process and that selection process. I do anticipate that there's going to need to be quite a bit of storage on the system, maybe even more than what is referenced in the law, but that's certainly a nice pathway to get things started with the certainty of the legislation. So hopefully, that's -- that's helpful.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Ross.\nRoss Fowler: Yes, Garrick, thank you. Sorry, Rejji. Go ahead.\nRejji Hayes: Yes. Ross, sorry. I've been a little slower the drawn a couple of my comments. So pardon me. The only thing I would just add and it sounded like you're alluding to when you talked about next week, a potential repeal of the IRA and the implications of that on tax credits. Is that the thrust of the second part of your question? Or did I miss it?\nRoss Fowler: Yes. Yes. Just as that -- where can we contextualize that versus the state incentives that are kind of pushing this?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. So I dare not wager or speculate as to the outcome on next week. I think that's a fool's errand and I think it's too difficult to call. But I do think it still remains a low probability that you see a repeal of the IRA. Because the reality is, one, you need a pretty sizable red way to just repeal the legislation. But even if you did want to hypothesize that that could take place, I think there's also a reality that the number of red states have benefited significantly from the legislation getting passed. I heard a stat the other day from one of the CEOs in our state who suggested about that 75% of the benefits of the IRA have accrued to red states. And so I think, again, even if you saw Red Wave significant enough, to, which I still think is a fairly remote probability to repeal the legislation. I still think there'll probably be a real significant discussion off-line about whether it would make sense from an economic perspective to go and undo all those benefits accruing really nationally, but again, more concentrated towards red states. So I still think it's a low probability event. And that said, and if it did happen, again, even if you wanted to take sort of that really remote probability come into fruition, we still have to comply with the law, to Garrick's comments, albeit it might be at a higher cost. But again, we still have to comply with the law in Michigan.\nRoss Fowler: Yes. Perfect. Makes sense. Rejji, you just seem more coffee this morning. So grab a cup of coffee.\nGarrick Rochow: Will do, yes.\nRoss Fowler: The next question I had, just kind of back to Jeremy's question a little bit on NorthStar and capacity auctions. I mean, MISO has sort of adopted a lot of the PJM changes around the VRR curve. So certainly, it seems like that will also go higher in next year's capacity auction at least that would mirror what happen at PJM. So do you sort of hold off on some closing down some of these open positions further out on capacity until you see what that auction clears out, so you have a better idea? Like I'm just trying to figure out the timing of how you work that through.\nGarrick Rochow: Our process has been with DIG to just layer these in over time. That's really a de-risking mechanism for us. And certainly, the sometimes where we might strike at a price point that's a little lower than the future, but there are times where it's going to strike at a price point that's a little higher than the future. And so we've had that approach. It really de-risks and becomes a predictable source of earnings by taking that -- these bilateral contracts or just kind of layer in minimum over time.\nRoss Fowler: Basically sense ties into this [indiscernible]. Thanks, guys, another solid quarter.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question today is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Guys, thank you so very much for the time. Appreciate it. Good to see you all guys. Get that coffee going.\nGarrick Rochow: Keep it going.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: So to the extent -- thinking of which -- you guys had this pretty big swing in the cost number in that waterfall slide, you talked about that minus $0.15 last quarter, that was a plus 9. You mentioned in your prepared remarks, insurance and IT. Can you speak a little bit on exactly what's going on? Is there a pull forward going in there as well that's timing intra year. I mean is there a wildfire impact that's impacting insurance? I'm just trying to understand what are the big pieces?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, Julien, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question, and let me provide a little bit more color on that. And so we have a number of cost-related line items that we track throughout the year. We obviously have expectations going into the year and budgeted levels for across every cost category. And through the course of the year, some of those line items track ahead of budget and not in a good way, so higher than budget. And so we countermeasure that largely through the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives. And in some cases, as we get to Q4, and we don't think we'll have sufficient countermeasures to offset that. There are times will just sort of fund those cost categories at levels that we anticipate at the end of the year. And so sorry, I said differently, we have a level of countermeasures as well as Q3 weather help that have given us enough contingency to fund those cost categories to levels that we anticipate than being at the end of the year. And so we're just funding those costs. Insurance was one example. We had IT-related costs that were trending a little ahead of budget. Another one is we also have some regulatory assets that are or liabilities that are amortizing that are at higher levels in the prior year associated with our EV programs and others. And so it's a hodgepodge of cats and dogs that were just trending ahead of budgeted levels. And so that's really what we're funding there. And that's why you see that big increase in the Q4 year-to-go expectations versus where we were in our Q2 call. Is that helpful?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. So basically said differently, you would have been holding off on funding some of it into 2025, you realize that you have the ability to do so, so you pull them back forward.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I wouldn't call them a pull ahead. To be clear, these are not expectations of costs that we'll have in 2025 that we're trying to de-risk. These are costs that we are incurring right now and the actuals we have seen in the first nine months of the year in excess of what we've budgeted. And so we're applying some of the contingency that we've accumulated through countermeasures, NorthStar outperformance and just point old-fashioned, good weather in September and applying that contingency to just fund those cost estimates for the end of the year. So these are just 2024 funding and just basically updating our forecast to reflect the economic reality we're seeing across those cost categories.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Wonderful. Thank you guys very much. Good job there.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nTravis Miller: Hi. So on the REP, you've touched on this a couple of times, but the -- anticipating that sales growth number going up. As you were going through that process, not to front run this too much for the next couple of weeks. But as you're going through the process, did you have enough visibility in terms of sales growth from data centers and what you mentioned on manufacturing some of those kind of 24/7 type loads to be able to incorporate, again, some of the stuff you touched on in terms of storage and perhaps other renewable technologies. Can we -- will we see that in this REP or is that something to look more for in the IRP?\nGarrick Rochow: The short answer is yes, but let me explain more. In the renewable energy plan, we'll start out with the base or the foundation is really the 2021 integrated resource plan, which you'll remember calls for 8 gigawatts of solar and we've built some renewables as part of that as well. So that's the foundation. The first piece will -- the 2021 IRP did not get us to 50% renewables by 2030 or the 60% number by 2035. So there's some renewables that will have to be constructed or through a PPA with an FCM, that will have to happen. That's tranche one. The second tranche is specifically because there's additional sales expected as a result of economic development. And so we forecast that out over 20 years, and so we do have visibility to it. But we have to have certainty around it as well. So these are items that we are -- have high confidence around, and we have signed contracts around. This is not the pipeline or some hypothetical numbers. It's -- again, a reflection of what's coming to the state in terms of -- so we have to answer question directly, yes, visibility of that. That will also drive additional renewable assets or purchase power agreements to meet that need as well. So if you continue to follow that down, I expect it to be a mix of solar and wind that will make that up. And then, of course, we'll talk about more details of that at EEI as we file that. So that's part one. The second part that I would also is the IRP. And remember, renewable energy plan just deals with energy. You have to deal with the capacity; you have to do with the reliability of supply. You also have the opportunity to accommodate additional sales growth. That will show up in the integrated resource plan as well. So I assume it's two mechanisms -- two opportunities where we'll see those tailwinds of again, ownership of assets, investments to deliver clean energy on behalf of our customers or through a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism.\nRejji Hayes: Hey Travis, this is Rejji. All I would add is that if you look at Slide 6 in our presentation today, you can see on the left-hand side of the page, and Garrick spoke to some of this in his prepared remarks, there's a raft of opportunities we've seen from an economic development perspective. And I think we've got eight or so listed on the page. Only two of those are in our current five-year plan, Goshen and Ford. The rest of these are additive to our plant. So that offers some breadcrumbs as to the additional opportunities we're seeing. And I will tell you that some of the opportunities that are pretty high in probability that we're still not quite in the plan yet are likely going to be coming to fruition in the coming months. And so there's a lot of opportunity that we've already seen since we rolled out last year's five-year plan. And so at this point, that's well stale. And so again, you'll see that update in our REP. You also see it in the five-year plan that we roll out in Q4 next year in addition to the IRP, as Garrick noted. So you get some visibility on Slide 6 today. And again, we're looking forward to talking about more opportunities in the coming months.\nTravis Miller: Okay. That's great. I appreciate all that detail. And then one more for me on different subject. The Liberty audit, would you anticipate on the regulatory side, the potential for putting in regulators to put in some kind of performance mechanism or some kind of metrics to meet before you get approval for the additional CapEx or operating costs?\nGarrick Rochow: I anticipate that we'll take the Liberty audit findings and weave them into our five-year reliability plan, which will, of course, enhance that plan, provide opportunities for additional capital investments to again address reliability for our customers proactively offering better service and lower cost. So that will be part of it. I anticipate there will be additional tree trimming or operation and maintenance expect that we've woven into the plan as well as part of this Liberty audit. And as the commission -- one of the actions that the commission has already taken is a performance-based ratemaking that's focused on reliability work. And so I anticipate that's woven into this work as well. I don't think it holds us up from making these important investments. And we're making them now and seeing good performance improvement in terms of reliability and we just need to continue to do that important work.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Sullivan: Hey everyone, good morning. I think it's been asked a couple of times now, but just to level set us for load growth and what's coming in the REP. My recollection is you have historically talked about 2% -- less 2% energy efficiency and you're kind of flat is kind of your base case today? And then, it sounds like you're excited about all this kind of new load growth, but what's actually going to be reflected in the REP is going to be pretty conservative and not some big shift change? Is that a fair characterization?\nRejji Hayes: Michael, good morning. It's Rejji. Thanks for the question. So just to level set, our current five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter this year, had about 0.5% of electric load growth on a five-year compound annual growth rate basis. And you're right, that number is always inclusive of energy waste reduction. And so if you wanted to gross that up, you could think about that as about 2.5% growth. And again, net of energy efficiency, 0.5%. We expect pretty significant upward pressure on that growth rate in the IRP -- sorry, from the REP, renewable energy plan, filing that we'll publicize in the coming weeks. And then we'll get another kick at the can, obviously, in the IRP filing about a year later. And again, between that, you'll get more color on the loan growth assumptions embedded in the five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter of next year. And so again, you should see pretty material upward pressure. We do plan conservatively, guilty as charged. But we do also want to reflect the reality of what we're seeing because remember, this is a component in our rate proceedings. And so you will see, again, upward pressure on that -- those load growth assumptions. And to Garrick\u2019s comments, we do really try to incorporate whether it's data centers, industrial companies; we try to incorporate those in the plan when they're close to being signed or effectively signed and moving forward. We really try not to speculate if we've seen some momentum across the state, but it's not coming to fruition. That's not something we'll put in our plan. So we're conservative from that perspective. But again, the takeaway here is that you'll see upward pressure on our historical growth estimates in this next cut.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. So significant upward pressure, but conservative. I got it. And then just shifting over to the electric case, I also just kind of wanted to level set there. So it sounds like you are going to probably adjudicate this mainly because of the storm mechanism because this is kind of a first go around for that? And what specifically are you asking for? And where is staff on that with respect to the storm specifically?\nGarrick Rochow: Rejji will walk through the numbers in a moment. Let me just start out by saying staff's position as a constructive starting point. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, there's a number of things that have been supported in SaaS position. But there are some distribution investments for our customers that have, I would say, been left on the table. And we're focused on improving reliability. We know we can do that, offer better service. We're proving that out by our five-year plan, and we can do that at a lower cost, doing it proactively versus reactively. And so in addition to the storm recovery mechanism, which you referenced, which is also referenced in the Liberty audit as well. But we're also focused on those distribution investments to offer better service for our customers. And so there's a bit of advocacy we are doing on behalf of our customers. So we can make those investments to improve service. That is also a component which may push us into an adjudicated order. But I'll remind everybody, I'm open to settlement. It's just going to have to have -- it's going to have to continue to be more than where the staff is currently at. But Rejji, just share with Mike where things are at from a cost perspective.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, so, Michael, the mechanics of the storm restoration tracker that we're proposing in our pending rate case. And if memory serves me, DTA is proposing a similar structure. We're essentially trying to take the five-year average of service restoration expense and put in the equivalent of a true-up mechanism where there's a 50% share for investors with customers. In the event our level of service restoration expense is above or below what's embedded in our rate case. So to give you a specific numerical example, if we had $130 million of service restoration expense in rates and a year in which we incurred $150 million of actuals, $10 million of that would be absorbed by shareholders. So we'd have $10 million of hurt flowing through our P&L and $10 million would be established in a regulatory asset that we would recover at a later date. And so customers would fund that portion of it. And if we saw the numbers go the other way, you would assume a commensurate level of regulatory liability and so on. And so it's -- as we see it, that provides good alignment of incentives between investors and customers with a mechanism like that, and we will limit a lot of the volatility we've seen in our P&L over the last several years because the levels of service restoration expense embedded in rates have been well below actuals now for the last several years and counting. And so that's the spirit of it and have to spend more time offline on that if need be.\nGarrick Rochow: And just to offer some numbers, our staff is at $170 million at a 9.5% ROE, 49.9% equity ratio. And our rebuttal position, we're at $277 million at 10.25% ROE, 50.75% equity ratio. So a little bit of cost of capital difference there as well. But I wanted to just make sure, Michael, you had the revised position of the company.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. That's great color. Just real quick, staff on the storm specifically though, are they outright against it or they're just looking for a different structure than what you just\u2026\nGarrick Rochow: They're not supportive of it, but again, not supportive, but we expected that. Just like the investment recovery mechanism, it had to go to the commission. And we anticipate some mechanism like this will require the commission to weigh in on. And so it's not a surprise we're to ask that. And again, if we're going to go after that, it's going to go likely to a full order.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Thanks for helping [ph] me through all that. I appreciate it.\nGarrick Rochow: You\u2019re welcome. Have a great day, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Weisel: I was also going about -- hi, I was also going to ask about settlement. I guess I appreciate the detail there. I guess if there were to be a deal to be made, what would be the window for that? Or is it a relevant to where that happens?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. We're in that window now. And so -- and really up to a final order as the window of opportunity for us. And so -- and we'll look -- again, we'll look, I'm always open to settlement. I've said that in calls before. If we can make things work for our customers and for all stakeholders, I mean that's a good place to be. There's just a couple of things in this case that may force us into a full order, and we just want to make sure everyone on the call is aware of that.\nAndrew Weisel: Yes. Understood. New tools are often a policy question. So I understand that completely. The other question I wanted to ask about the CapEx update. I understand we'll have to be patient on the numbers. But the two things I wanted to ask about. Number one, just qualitatively, it sounds like there's going to be a lot of things going into that. There's always a business as usual update, but you've got spending around the REP. You got spending around the Liberty reliability audit, you've got the electric reliability roadmap with stuff going in there, plus you've got sort of a step change in demand growth from data centers and manufacturing, what I'm getting at is, should this be a meaningfully bigger increase than what we've seen in recent years? And if so, how should we think about financing that? You previously talked about up to a $350 million per year of equity in 2025 and beyond. I'm guessing there might be an upside bias to that given all the pieces that I just mentioned. How should we think about a rule of thumb about incremental equity needs per incremental dollar of CapEx? Thank you.\nGarrick Rochow: Rejji and I'll tag team this one, but I want to remind you that many of the tailwinds that we described in this call come as a result of approval of the renewable energy plan or approval of the IRP. And so although we'll file it in November of this year, fast-forward 10 months. So it's going to be in late Q3 of 2025 before we see where the commission is at with that. And so I wouldn't expect some of that good work to show up until our Q4 call at the end of 2025, early part of 2026. And then you'd have the same cycle for the IRP, which would start in 2026 and then play out in 2027. So I see these as tranches that go over time over the five years. Clearly, there's some tailwinds here, but they show up at different points in time. But I'll turn it over to Rejji to offer some additional color.\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I think that's exactly right, Andrew. I mean the governors we've talked about and when we prepare our capital plan, our affordability balance sheet and an operational feasibility. Can we get the work done and those remain governors. But the fourth governor at this point is the pacing to Garrick's comment. And so just the time for the commission to review the REP, the time for the load opportunities to materialize. Yes, we signed contracts, we interconnect these opportunities, but it takes a while for build-out of a manufacturing facility or data center. So the pacing is going to certainly dictate when we'll be able to bring in all of this additional capital opportunity and see the load materialize, which effectively will fund those capital investment opportunities. So that's really the fourth governor at this point. But you will see upward pressure for sure in the $17 billion five-year CapEx number we've provided at this point. So without a doubt, but it will be pacing before you see the material bump, but I feel very good about the underlying earnings growth and rate base growth that will come from the next vintage. With respect to equity, as you know, and as you stated, we have said no equity obviously in 2024. And then up to $350 million starting next year and we've said that's a pretty good run rate for the current $17 billion capital plan and the sensitivity I'll share with you as you think about incremental capital going into the plan and what that might drive in terms of incremental equity needs. As a general rule of thumb is for every dollar of CapEx we invest at the utility, we usually fund it with around $0.35 to $0.40 of common equity, and that has been tried and true for some time. Now what's interesting over the last, I'll say, two years to three years is that we've seen downward pressure that sensitivity in terms of the equity needs, and it's really been driven by a few things. One, obviously, we just continue to generate substantial cash flow in the business, because of the forward-looking test year and the rate construct of Michigan. So I'll give an example, our prior five-year plan of $15.5 billion of capital generated about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow over a five-year period in aggregate. This current vintage is $17 billion. We expect $13.2 billion of cumulative operating cash flow generation, vintage over vintage. So almost $1 billion of increased vintage over vintage. And so just good cash flow generation. That's one. Number two, the ability to monetize tax credits afforded to us through the IRA, that's another big driver of liquidity and effectively a new source of equity that's helping our metrics and then just offering another layer of liquidity to fund our capital plan. So that's also helpful and we did our first tranche this year, about $90 million of dispositions, and we did that at levels better than planned, meaning the discount to par was better than we thought it would be. And so I anticipate us doing more of that over time. And then the last one is just -- I feel like a broken record when I say this is, we do plan conservatively. And so for the debt we're going to issue at the holding company, we're assuming it's straight debt with no equity credit, but we've been known to issue subordinated notes or hybrids in the past. Those get now a greater level of equity credit from Moody's, as you know, and so we're at 50% now. And so if we start to see pricing for those types of securities improve over time, that creates an opportunity also to put downward pressure on that sensitivity because obviously, if we see pricing comparable to what our debt assumptions are in our plan, then we can do hybrids at a level that's credit accretive and EPS accretive to plan. And so those all create opportunities for us to really minimize the equity needs as we increase the capital in our five-year plan.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. That's extremely helpful details there. Thank you very much. So just to be clear on the CapEx numbers, though, so we should not expect numbers related to the REP or IRP but we should expect upside to CapEx related to reliability and the demand and economic development. Is that maybe a fair way to put it?\nRejji Hayes: Yes. You certainly won't see the full magnitude of opportunities associated with the REP. And the other reason I'm qualifying the comment a little bit, Andrew, is that you start to earn on PPAs effective mid-this year, and so we'll assume additional PPAs going forward. And so we'll start to see that opportunity associated with the renewable energy plan scale every year because we're doing PPAs for renewables every year. We'll probably start to layer in some of the capital investment opportunities in outer years of the plan. And so you'll see some of that weaved in and you'll definitely see your comment reliability and resiliency. But again, the lumpier opportunities associated with the energy law, you won't see until really starting in the 2026 vintage of our five-year plan.\nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Appreciate you are clarifying. I guess, maybe I needed some coffee this morning as well or some early Halloween candy perhaps. Thank you guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And for our next question, we'll move to the line of Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just have one question. So when I look at your current supply stack on the system, I mean, how much of it is imports from like self-generation versus the imports from the grid. And I understand that the MISO dispatches assets, et cetera. But I'm just debating how much of spare capacity that you have of your own right now? I mean, if I were to be an industrial customer or hyperscaler, how much could you offer me in megawatts right now?\nGarrick Rochow: Well, let me offer you this and then we'll talk a little bit about the mix from MISO and the like. After our 2021 integrated resource plan, we were along from a capacity perspective. And there was a couple of things. One, we kept additional assets available to us as part of the settlement. We acquired the Covert Generating facility was 1.2 gigawatts. In the meantime, since 2022, when that was approved, we've also built out renewable assets, both wind and solar, and both here some PPAs as well as some owned assets. And so that's actually put in a position where we've been long and we've been able to accommodate a lot of sales growth. And then, as a reminder, we have the mechanisms, both the renewable energy plan and the integrated resource plan with some flexibility in those because we look at them -- two years on a renewable energy plan basis every three to five on an integrated resource plan, but we can pull it up and adjust those as needed to be able to accommodate the additional growth. The third piece with these hyperscalers is working with them because they're not going to all come on immediately. And they have plans and when they want to ramp up. That's also true with manufacturing. And so they may need a starting load in 2026, but their full ramp-up doesn't get out to 2028, 2029, 2030. And so there's a lot of work that we do with the customers to make sure we get that right. And so there's a lot of flexibility we have to make sure the supply and demand stack match up nicely and we can grow Michigan in the state. Now, we do leverage MISO to be able to do that. And if you look at our total mix, it's about 46%, 40-ish, 5% that we either have through PPAs or through purchase off market. Remember those PPAs act as both capacity and energy as well in that mix. And then the rest is self-generated.\nAngie Storozynski: But again, I'm just -- again, I'm debating it myself, if I were to cite like a big industrial facility or a data center, I would probably care about the speed to power, right? So this initial availability of megawatts would probably matter to me. So you're saying you are long tower even right now. So even, say, the next, say, 24 months, there is spare capacity that you could allocate to such a user?\nGarrick Rochow: The short answer is yes. And we work closely with customers to be able to do that. I'll give you a real example. And it just hit the press today, we talked about in Q1, but we couldn't name the company. Switch, which is an existing data center in Michigan, is expanding by 230 megawatts. They want to be up by full load in 2026. We're able to do that. We're able to deliver that, as the electric infrastructure, both with our transmission partner and the distribution infrastructure as well as ensuring we have the supply. And so that gives you a little nature of our ability to deliver on that. And as we other -- entertain other hyperscalers or other manufacturing, again, we work with them closely to match up the ramp-up schedule. I gave the example of Corning as well in my prepared remarks. Corning wants to out low down by the first quarter of 2025. We're constructing the substation right now. We will deliver that. But again they want to ramp up. They go from a small amount of megawatts up to 90, 95 megawatts. That quarter is over a year. And so we pace that along with that company. So those are two real examples, real work going on in the state and just gives you an idea of how we work with customers to grow Michigan and grow in our service territory.\nAngie Storozynski: And what if there is like a very big site, let's say, a gig of eventual capacity? I mean, is this something that you feel comfortable accommodating. I mean, it is obviously, that would probably require a large -- well, two large combined cycle gas bonds to be built. How do you think about those sort of very big projects? Would you prefer to have smaller sites? Or is there, from like a risk perspective, do you think comfortable accommodating the big loads like that?\nGarrick Rochow: We welcome growth in Michigan. I mean there's nothing better than create jobs. And we've got a constructive -- I mean, we're doing a lot of onshoring. It is truly a manufacturing renaissance. We're certainly open for data centers as well. And we work with those customers, large sites, small sites, to create opportunity for all stakeholders in the state. And so it doesn't -- we don't back away from a gigawatt load. Some of those are on one site; some of those are across multiple sites. And it's really, again, working with that company on their ramp-up schedule and when do we need to provide that and match that supply/demand mix. We've been doing this for 135 years. I used to be -- I started out my business -- in the business, I should say, on the supply side. So I get this. And that's what we do as a load serving entity; we have the mechanisms within the construct to be able to do that with success.\nAngie Storozynski: And just to make sure. And how do you, for example, ensure that this load actually materializes like when we look at power companies, like they have those take-or-pay contracts. How do you ensure that if you make the investments, actually the load will happen?\nGarrick Rochow: One of it is contractually, but it's also, as I shared in my earlier remarks, making sure we've got a good -- from a rate design perspective, a cost of service model. That's how we operate in the State of Michigan. And so that makes sure that the other customers aren't subsidizing that work. And as I shared, we're working closely with commission and commission staff with data centers to see if there's additional rate compact or construct to be able to further ensure that residential customers aren't subsidizing or putting the bill for the data centers.\nOperator: Our next question will be from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAnthony Crowdell: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for squeezing me in. And I know it's a tough morning with Shar telling you what music to listen to and Ross telling you what to drink. So I'll keep it quick. Just I apologize. I think it's up to Mike Sullivan's question, the low drills update. Will we get that on the fourth quarter call on when you file the IRP, just when is the most up-to-date of the load growth.\nRejji Hayes: Anthony, this is Rejji. Yes. So you will get a load forecast update and the renewable energy plan that we'll file in the coming weeks, and you will also -- we will also have a load growth update a few months later, that's supporting the five-year plan that we'll roll out on our fourth quarter call in the first quarter of 2025 as we always do. So you'll get a couple of bites of the cherry from a load growth perspective. And as Garrick noted in his earlier comments, you'll also see a load growth update about a year from then, maybe 1.5 years in the context of our IRP filing. So we'll have an iterative process for load disclosure. And again, as I said earlier, I expect upward pressure certainly on current estimate of 0.5%. That would certainly go up and it will likely accrete beyond that. So looking forward to sharing those with you in the coming weeks and months.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And then just lastly, one of the earlier questions, you talked about how the financing needs of the company. Also, I think the amount of equity now maybe 30% to 40% for every dollar spent. You also mentioned tax credits were going to be instrumental. Has the company quantified what we could assume for transferability over the next five years?\nRejji Hayes: So the latest number I'll guide you to is what we have embedded in our five-year plan, Anthony, and that's a little over $0.5 billion. But again, I expect that number to increase over time just based on the quality of the execution and also the anticipation of more renewable ownership should allow that number to accrete. And so this current plan has $0.5 billion in aggregate over five years. And again, as we provide an update on our five-year plan on our fourth quarter call and Q1 of next year, I'll provide a revised number, and I'd be surprised if that number doesn't continue to increase. Is that helpful?\nAnthony Crowdell: Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions and see you in Hollywood.\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, see you in Hollywood\nOperator: We have no further questions in the queue at this time. So I would now like to hand the call back over to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Harry. And I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you at EEI, take care and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 9, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first nine months of 2024 and our year-to-go expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analyses herein are in comparison to 2023 both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the third quarter, we delivered adjusted net income of $736 million or $2.47 per share, which compares favorably to the first nine months of 2023, largely due to higher rate relief, net of investment costs, and solid performance at Northstar. From a weather perspective, the third quarter offered favorable weather versus the prior year to the tune of $0.10 per share, largely due to a warm September. The strong third quarter weather for the electric business more than offset the mild weather experience in the first half of the year, thus equating to $0.05 per share of positive variance year-to-date. As mentioned, rate relief net of investment costs, one of the key drivers of our year-to-date performance resulted in $0.18 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved on our electric rate order received in March and the residual benefits of last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our year-to-date financial performance was largely driven by lower service restoration expense despite a sizable weather system that impacted our service territory in early August. Our favorable variance in this regard has been fueled in large part by cost efficiencies in our storm response efforts. In fact, even though our volume of outages has increased by approximately 10% in 2024 versus the comparable period last year, our restoration cost per interruption has decreased by over 10%, all while restoring customers at a faster rate than the prior year. These achievements and our storm response efforts are just another example of our lean operating system, the CE Way, driving daily productivity in the business. Quite simply, our workforce uses the tools of the lean operating system to deliver more value to customers with less resources every day. That is the essence of the CE Way, and this favorability and service restoration expense coupled with cost performance throughout the business provided $0.02 per share of positive variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first nine months of the year, you'll note the $0.16 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch all bucket in the middle of the chart; the primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at Northstar and a tax related benefit, among other factors. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.14 per share of positive variance for the remaining three months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the last three months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.09 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which went into effect on October 1, as Garrick noted. On the cost side, we anticipate $0.15 per share of negative variance for the remaining three months of 2024; in large part due to additional funding support for select cost categories that have trended above budgeted levels for the majority of the year, such as insurance premium and IT-related expenses. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select one-time countermeasures from last year and conservative assumptions around non-utility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.25 to $0.31 per share of negative variance. In summary, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. As such, we are reaffirming our full year guidance range of $3.29 per share to $3.35 per share with a continued bias toward the high end. Moving on to the balance sheet. On Slide 10, we highlight our recently reaffirmed credit ratings from S&P in August. We continue to target mid-teens FFO to debt on a consolidated basis over our planning period to preserve our solid investment-grade credit ratings as per long-standing guidance from the rating agencies. As always, we remain focused on maintaining a strong financial position, which coupled with a supportive regulatory construct and predictable operating cash flow generation supports our solid investment-grade ratings to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan on Slide 11. I'm pleased to report that we've completed all of our planned financings for the year at levels favorable to plan and ahead of schedule, which leaves us with ample liquidity for the remainder of the year and beyond. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financings at the utility given the need to rebalance the rate-making capital structure in accordance with the recent regulatory outcomes and attractive pricing at issuance. It is also worth noting that we remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Jeremy, this is Rejji. All I would add is we've been -- Jeremy, just to provide a bit more of a financial lens to Garrick's good comments. As you know, we've had a good 25% to 30% open margin in the outer years of our plan. And so we'll provide an update on our Q4 call, as we always do around the levels at which we're pricing capacity contracts in that bilateral market. And as you know, we'll bring in a new year in our next five-year plan, and that will have even more open margin. And we continue to see reverse inquiry at levels well in excess of what we've historically realized from a capacity price perspective. And so we're usually around $3 to $3.50 per kilowatt month. We're now seeing 5 and 6 handles in reverse increase. So still a really robust opportunity. And unsurprisingly, it's just because of the real nice tactical we're seeing with just supply being reduced in Zone 7 through retirements and upward pressure on the demand curve. So we don't see any reason why that should abate anytime soon. Jeremy, all I would add to Garrick's comments is that when you think about the components of what will drive long-term growth, Garrick walked through in great detail in his prepared remarks, the opportunities on the capital side, whether it's through the capital investments and/or earning on PPAs in the context of new energy law, and that's going to be decades of financial opportunity, investment in PPAs again, the opportunities to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric distribution, infrastructure that's decades of spend and investment opportunity to the benefit of customers and investors. And then in the gas business, which we didn't talk about as much on this call, but there's still a significant level of investment to be made to continue to harden that system, reduce future methane emissions and continue to keep it safe in the lab, particularly with pending regs coming out from FEMSA. And so a lot of investment opportunity and when the upward pressure that you alluded to on the demand side that will create the headroom among other benefits to facilitate and enable that investment to come to fruition. And so we see a really nice glide path to deliver on that differentiated 6% to 8% growth for many years, compounding off of actuals. And so we're not going to get ahead of our Q4 disclosure, and that's when we update our five-year plan, but we still feel very good about our ability to strengthen and lengthen that growth to Garrick's comments. Yes, Ross. Yes. Ross, sorry. I've been a little slower the drawn a couple of my comments. So pardon me. The only thing I would just add and it sounded like you're alluding to when you talked about next week, a potential repeal of the IRA and the implications of that on tax credits. Is that the thrust of the second part of your question? Or did I miss it? Yes. So I dare not wager or speculate as to the outcome on next week. I think that's a fool's errand and I think it's too difficult to call. But I do think it still remains a low probability that you see a repeal of the IRA. Because the reality is, one, you need a pretty sizable red way to just repeal the legislation. But even if you did want to hypothesize that that could take place, I think there's also a reality that the number of red states have benefited significantly from the legislation getting passed. I heard a stat the other day from one of the CEOs in our state who suggested about that 75% of the benefits of the IRA have accrued to red states. And so I think, again, even if you saw Red Wave significant enough, to, which I still think is a fairly remote probability to repeal the legislation. I still think there'll probably be a real significant discussion off-line about whether it would make sense from an economic perspective to go and undo all those benefits accruing really nationally, but again, more concentrated towards red states. So I still think it's a low probability event. And that said, and if it did happen, again, even if you wanted to take sort of that really remote probability come into fruition, we still have to comply with the law, to Garrick's comments, albeit it might be at a higher cost. But again, we still have to comply with the law in Michigan. Yes, Julien, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question, and let me provide a little bit more color on that. And so we have a number of cost-related line items that we track throughout the year. We obviously have expectations going into the year and budgeted levels for across every cost category. And through the course of the year, some of those line items track ahead of budget and not in a good way, so higher than budget. And so we countermeasure that largely through the CE Way and other cost reduction initiatives. And in some cases, as we get to Q4, and we don't think we'll have sufficient countermeasures to offset that. There are times will just sort of fund those cost categories at levels that we anticipate at the end of the year. And so sorry, I said differently, we have a level of countermeasures as well as Q3 weather help that have given us enough contingency to fund those cost categories to levels that we anticipate than being at the end of the year. And so we're just funding those costs. Insurance was one example. We had IT-related costs that were trending a little ahead of budget. Another one is we also have some regulatory assets that are or liabilities that are amortizing that are at higher levels in the prior year associated with our EV programs and others. And so it's a hodgepodge of cats and dogs that were just trending ahead of budgeted levels. And so that's really what we're funding there. And that's why you see that big increase in the Q4 year-to-go expectations versus where we were in our Q2 call. Is that helpful? Yes, I wouldn't call them a pull ahead. To be clear, these are not expectations of costs that we'll have in 2025 that we're trying to de-risk. These are costs that we are incurring right now and the actuals we have seen in the first nine months of the year in excess of what we've budgeted. And so we're applying some of the contingency that we've accumulated through countermeasures, NorthStar outperformance and just point old-fashioned, good weather in September and applying that contingency to just fund those cost estimates for the end of the year. So these are just 2024 funding and just basically updating our forecast to reflect the economic reality we're seeing across those cost categories. Hey Travis, this is Rejji. All I would add is that if you look at Slide 6 in our presentation today, you can see on the left-hand side of the page, and Garrick spoke to some of this in his prepared remarks, there's a raft of opportunities we've seen from an economic development perspective. And I think we've got eight or so listed on the page. Only two of those are in our current five-year plan, Goshen and Ford. The rest of these are additive to our plant. So that offers some breadcrumbs as to the additional opportunities we're seeing. And I will tell you that some of the opportunities that are pretty high in probability that we're still not quite in the plan yet are likely going to be coming to fruition in the coming months. And so there's a lot of opportunity that we've already seen since we rolled out last year's five-year plan. And so at this point, that's well stale. And so again, you'll see that update in our REP. You also see it in the five-year plan that we roll out in Q4 next year in addition to the IRP, as Garrick noted. So you get some visibility on Slide 6 today. And again, we're looking forward to talking about more opportunities in the coming months. Michael, good morning. It's Rejji. Thanks for the question. So just to level set, our current five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter this year, had about 0.5% of electric load growth on a five-year compound annual growth rate basis. And you're right, that number is always inclusive of energy waste reduction. And so if you wanted to gross that up, you could think about that as about 2.5% growth. And again, net of energy efficiency, 0.5%. We expect pretty significant upward pressure on that growth rate in the IRP -- sorry, from the REP, renewable energy plan, filing that we'll publicize in the coming weeks. And then we'll get another kick at the can, obviously, in the IRP filing about a year later. And again, between that, you'll get more color on the loan growth assumptions embedded in the five-year plan that we rolled out in the fourth quarter of next year. And so again, you should see pretty material upward pressure. We do plan conservatively, guilty as charged. But we do also want to reflect the reality of what we're seeing because remember, this is a component in our rate proceedings. And so you will see, again, upward pressure on that -- those load growth assumptions. And to Garrick's comments, we do really try to incorporate whether it's data centers, industrial companies; we try to incorporate those in the plan when they're close to being signed or effectively signed and moving forward. We really try not to speculate if we've seen some momentum across the state, but it's not coming to fruition. That's not something we'll put in our plan. So we're conservative from that perspective. But again, the takeaway here is that you'll see upward pressure on our historical growth estimates in this next cut. Yes, so, Michael, the mechanics of the storm restoration tracker that we're proposing in our pending rate case. And if memory serves me, DTA is proposing a similar structure. We're essentially trying to take the five-year average of service restoration expense and put in the equivalent of a true-up mechanism where there's a 50% share for investors with customers. In the event our level of service restoration expense is above or below what's embedded in our rate case. So to give you a specific numerical example, if we had $130 million of service restoration expense in rates and a year in which we incurred $150 million of actuals, $10 million of that would be absorbed by shareholders. So we'd have $10 million of hurt flowing through our P&L and $10 million would be established in a regulatory asset that we would recover at a later date. And so customers would fund that portion of it. And if we saw the numbers go the other way, you would assume a commensurate level of regulatory liability and so on. And so it's -- as we see it, that provides good alignment of incentives between investors and customers with a mechanism like that, and we will limit a lot of the volatility we've seen in our P&L over the last several years because the levels of service restoration expense embedded in rates have been well below actuals now for the last several years and counting. And so that's the spirit of it and have to spend more time offline on that if need be. Yes, I think that's exactly right, Andrew. I mean the governors we've talked about and when we prepare our capital plan, our affordability balance sheet and an operational feasibility. Can we get the work done and those remain governors. But the fourth governor at this point is the pacing to Garrick's comment. And so just the time for the commission to review the REP, the time for the load opportunities to materialize. Yes, we signed contracts, we interconnect these opportunities, but it takes a while for build-out of a manufacturing facility or data center. So the pacing is going to certainly dictate when we'll be able to bring in all of this additional capital opportunity and see the load materialize, which effectively will fund those capital investment opportunities. So that's really the fourth governor at this point. But you will see upward pressure for sure in the $17 billion five-year CapEx number we've provided at this point. So without a doubt, but it will be pacing before you see the material bump, but I feel very good about the underlying earnings growth and rate base growth that will come from the next vintage. With respect to equity, as you know, and as you stated, we have said no equity obviously in 2024. And then up to $350 million starting next year and we've said that's a pretty good run rate for the current $17 billion capital plan and the sensitivity I'll share with you as you think about incremental capital going into the plan and what that might drive in terms of incremental equity needs. As a general rule of thumb is for every dollar of CapEx we invest at the utility, we usually fund it with around $0.35 to $0.40 of common equity, and that has been tried and true for some time. Now what's interesting over the last, I'll say, two years to three years is that we've seen downward pressure that sensitivity in terms of the equity needs, and it's really been driven by a few things. One, obviously, we just continue to generate substantial cash flow in the business, because of the forward-looking test year and the rate construct of Michigan. So I'll give an example, our prior five-year plan of $15.5 billion of capital generated about $12.5 billion of operating cash flow over a five-year period in aggregate. This current vintage is $17 billion. We expect $13.2 billion of cumulative operating cash flow generation, vintage over vintage. So almost $1 billion of increased vintage over vintage. And so just good cash flow generation. That's one. Number two, the ability to monetize tax credits afforded to us through the IRA, that's another big driver of liquidity and effectively a new source of equity that's helping our metrics and then just offering another layer of liquidity to fund our capital plan. So that's also helpful and we did our first tranche this year, about $90 million of dispositions, and we did that at levels better than planned, meaning the discount to par was better than we thought it would be. And so I anticipate us doing more of that over time. And then the last one is just -- I feel like a broken record when I say this is, we do plan conservatively. And so for the debt we're going to issue at the holding company, we're assuming it's straight debt with no equity credit, but we've been known to issue subordinated notes or hybrids in the past. Those get now a greater level of equity credit from Moody's, as you know, and so we're at 50% now. And so if we start to see pricing for those types of securities improve over time, that creates an opportunity also to put downward pressure on that sensitivity because obviously, if we see pricing comparable to what our debt assumptions are in our plan, then we can do hybrids at a level that's credit accretive and EPS accretive to plan. And so those all create opportunities for us to really minimize the equity needs as we increase the capital in our five-year plan. Yes. You certainly won't see the full magnitude of opportunities associated with the REP. And the other reason I'm qualifying the comment a little bit, Andrew, is that you start to earn on PPAs effective mid-this year, and so we'll assume additional PPAs going forward. And so we'll start to see that opportunity associated with the renewable energy plan scale every year because we're doing PPAs for renewables every year. We'll probably start to layer in some of the capital investment opportunities in outer years of the plan. And so you'll see some of that weaved in and you'll definitely see your comment reliability and resiliency. But again, the lumpier opportunities associated with the energy law, you won't see until really starting in the 2026 vintage of our five-year plan. Anthony, this is Rejji. Yes. So you will get a load forecast update and the renewable energy plan that we'll file in the coming weeks, and you will also -- we will also have a load growth update a few months later, that's supporting the five-year plan that we'll roll out on our fourth quarter call in the first quarter of 2025 as we always do. So you'll get a couple of bites of the cherry from a load growth perspective. And as Garrick noted in his earlier comments, you'll also see a load growth update about a year from then, maybe 1.5 years in the context of our IRP filing. So we'll have an iterative process for load disclosure. And again, as I said earlier, I expect upward pressure certainly on current estimate of 0.5%. That would certainly go up and it will likely accrete beyond that. So looking forward to sharing those with you in the coming weeks and months. So the latest number I'll guide you to is what we have embedded in our five-year plan, Anthony, and that's a little over $0.5 billion. But again, I expect that number to increase over time just based on the quality of the execution and also the anticipation of more renewable ownership should allow that number to accrete. And so this current plan has $0.5 billion in aggregate over five years. And again, as we provide an update on our five-year plan on our fourth quarter call and Q1 of next year, I'll provide a revised number, and I'd be surprised if that number doesn't continue to increase. Is that helpful?"

            "name": "Garrick Rochow",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. At CMS Energy, we deliver year-over-year for all stakeholders. We do that through our investment thesis. This is simple but powerful model coupled with our disciplined execution sets us apart in the industry and has delivered more than two decades of industry-leading financial performance. Typically, I walk through that investment thesis. But today, I want to offer three differentiators at CMS Energy providing confidence and visibility as we continue to strengthen and lengthen our 6% to 8% EPS growth. First, Michigan's clean energy law. This law is great for our customers, the planet, and our investors. It ensures we have the right legislation in place to move from coal to clean, providing certainty for the investments we need to make in renewable energy and it gives us the flexibility to either own the assets or utilize a power purchase agreement doing what is best for our customers. Now, here's what's unique. Earning a financial compensation mechanism approximately 9% on a power purchase agreement, no other state that I'm aware of has this provision and then add to it requirements for battery storage and an increased incentive on energy efficiency. There is a lot in this law, very little of which is in our five-year investment plan, providing a strong tailwind and we believe we can do this important work affordably for our customers. The flexibility in the law that allows for ownership or power purchase agreements both within Michigan and outside of Michigan provides more options for customers and ensures we can utilize lower cost energy. Furthermore, it provides us the ability to replace existing, outdated, and above market power purchase agreements with new renewable assets, which keeps costs affordable for customers. Our 20-year renewable energy plan or REP that we'll file next month will detail our clean energy investments and plans to achieve the targets set by Michigan's clean energy law. This filing will show the renewable assets needed above and beyond our 2021 integrated resource plan as well as the additional renewable assets needed to meet increasing sales demand and growth in the state. As I shared before, Michigan's clean energy law is great for all stakeholders. It provides the flexibility we need to find the most cost effective clean energy for our customers. The second item I want to highlight is our commitment to customer reliability. I'm very proud of the comprehensive plan we have laid out in our five-year $7 billion electric reliability roadmap. This plan details our actions to move to second quartile reliability performance or SAIDI by the end of the decade through targeted investments in our electric grid, needed investments for our customers because we have recorded some of Michigan's highest wind speeds over the last five years. We are seeing more frequent storm activity. This plan is deliberate and comprehensive and improves reliability in the short-term and built in long-term resiliency and it does it proactively versus reactively. This plan means we will begin serious efforts to underground more of our distribution wires, better align with Midwest peers, and replace more than 20,000 poles with those designed for more extreme weather. It also means investing in grid technology for more automation and machine learning to speed up restoration in weather events. We're also one of the first utilities East of the Mississippi is file a comprehensive wildfire mitigation plan, which lays out the investments needed to prepare for climate change. These customer investments are based on Electric Power Research Institute, EPRI best practices and will bolster our distribution system to a level of performance our customers expect, particularly as the economy continues to electrify. And our plans have been supported. I am pleased with the recent outcomes from the Michigan Public Service Commission and the Liberty storm audit, which highlights the vastness of our system, the billions of dollars and decades needed to improve it and the importance of these strategic investments. And our customary benefit when we improve the system proactively versus reactively, making these investments in the system now means we can do it at a 40% to 70% lower cost compared to when we do this work following an outage. Better service, lower customer cost, this is a great story. The third point I want to make today is the nice tailwind of economic development we are seeing in our service area. I'm excited and encouraged about the true renaissance underway in Michigan. The big story across the industry is sales growth brought by data centers. We're seeing the same and we're happy to talk more about data centers. Our story is different and in my opinion, better. In Michigan, we are seeing a manufacturing renaissance bolstered by onshoring, unique state attributes, and the inflation reduction and the CHIPS and Science Act. And we love manufacturing growth because it brings jobs, supply chains, commercial activity, housing starts and residential growth where there is greater benefit for the state. We recently updated this slide to highlight several new and diversified examples. Corning expanding and investing up to $900 million and bringing nearly 1,100 jobs to the state, this is the sort of growth we like to see significant Michigan investment in job growth. Saab has expansion plans for an integration and assembly facility. Saab is new to the state but adding to the nearly 4,000 businesses engaged in defense and aerospace work in Michigan. Two new examples among many that speak to the diversified manufacturing growth we are realizing over 700 megawatts of signed contracts in 24 months and growing. Our economic development pipeline continues to look promising with over 6 gigawatts of load looking to either move to or expand in our state, 60% of which is manufacturing. As I mentioned earlier, our renewable energy plan will conservatively reflect our updated load growth forecast based on the strong economic development tailwind we are experiencing. We work hard every day to win our customers business and we are honored when businesses see the value in investing in our state and our service territory. So let's take a look at the regulatory calendar for the year. As I shared last quarter, our financial related regulatory outcomes are known for the year given the constructive March electric rate order in the approved gas rate case settlement. This positions us well as we navigate the last quarter of 2024. Gas rates were effective October 1 and we plan to file our next gas rate case in December of this year. In our current electric rate case, we saw a constructive starting position by staff. We saw support for further underground, wildfire mitigation, and the continuation of the investment recovery mechanism. I do want to point out that the mechanism for storm recovery and the investments outlined in the electric rate case and in the Liberty storm audit are important for our customers. That probably goes without saying. However, it may require that we go to a fully adjudicated order to get the best outcome for our customers. Know that we are confident with where we are in the process, the quality of our filing, and the proactive nature of the investments we are making to improve reliability for our customers. If we go the full distance, we expect the order in March of 2025. Now, let's spend a moment on the results. For the first nine months, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.47, up $0.41 versus the same period in 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. Given our confidence in the year, we are reaffirming all our financial objectives, including this year's guidance range of $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. We are initiating our full year guidance for 2025 at $3.52 to $3.58 per share, reflecting 6% to 8% growth off the midpoint of this year's range. And we are well-positioned, just like 2024, to be toward the high end of that range. It is important to remember that we always rebase guidance off our actuals on the Q4 call, compounding our growth. This brings you a higher quality of earnings and differentiates us from others in the sector. And like we've done in previous years, we'll provide a refresh of our five-year capital and financial plans on the Q4 call. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy over two decades of consistent industry-leading financial performance. We remain confident in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. Hey, I like your choices. Yes, Metallica, but you don't have AC/DC. If you would have brought a little AC/DC, I'd have been there. What's your question today? There you go. There you go. Michigan in our service territory, specifically you referenced Grand Rapids and that's been our service territory, is a great place for data centers and investment in Michigan. The temperate climate, the fiber infrastructure and to your point and really the point of your question here is we have the electric infrastructure to be able to serve. And so we work closely with data centers and other manufacturing customers to meet their timelines for the ramp-up and load. And so that makes us advantageous to locate a data center or as I highlighted in my prepared remarks, really manufacturing, there's been a lot of manufacturing growth that's shown up here. And so that's what's exciting about Michigan. I guess, the other thing is, too, when they look to our clean energy law, they can see a path to that growing clean energy, the renewables and then the clean energy standard by 2040, which is also attractive to the data center components. But I would highlight, too, just what I don't want to lose in this conversation is manufacturing growth. That's really where we've seen the true renaissance. We've seen a lot of opportunities show up there that will show up in our renewable energy plan as well, to serve our customers. And from my -- just going to the question on the tariff, you'll recall, we've already filed ex-parte type filing to move the data centers to what we call our GPD rate. That's a better reflection of the cost to serve, and we are working collaboratively with the commission to see if another rate structure is needed for data centers that would ensure our residential customers are not left subsidizing data centers. We would expect that we continue to make progress. I mean, like I said, the ex-parte filing has already been approved. And so we're in a good position there from a cost of service perspective. We'll continue to work with the commission. I would expect that to take place over the next six months to a year. This -- this audit that was completed -- we call it the Liberty audit because that was the company that was performing the work is really balanced and supportive. I mean, you could see that in the context of the support of the work that we need to do, the capital investments and free trimming to be able to continue to enhance reliability and provide better service and as in my prepared remarks, share, we can do that at a lower cost. So better service, lower cost when we do things proactively versus reactively, and so we have our five-year capital plan, that $7 billion plan that's comprehensive and very deliberate and focus. And we'll take the Liberty audit results, and we'll look to incorporate that in that plan. And I'll remind you, that's a $7 billion plan; $5.5 billion of it is incorporated into the capital plan. And so there's opportunity there to work more of that capital in, of course, with the support of the Public Service Commission staff and commission. AC/DC. AC/DC. NorthStar business, and I'll get to the big piece, continues to perform well. But frankly, I'd expect that. It's a small piece of the earnings mix. But they need to perform, and we expect them to perform, and that's exactly what they're doing, both from an operational and a financial perspective. And of course, DIG is an important part of that mix or Dearborn Industrial Generation. And we continue to see strength both in the capacity markets and the energy markets, and we are securing those bilateral contracts throughout time, and they continue to be above our plan and our expectations. And so it's a great story, and we continue to be a tailwind in our overall expectations around 6% to 8% EPS growth. And one thing I'll remind you, Jeremy, too, it's not linear as well. We do have outages to maintain the system out there. So that's an important piece to remember, particularly as we go through the long-term plan. Let me offer some comments, and I'm sure Rejji is going to want to jump into this as well. And we provided those differentiators, those tailwinds to give visibility and to instill confidence. And that's what we have. We have confidence about the ability to strengthen and lengthen that 6% to 8% EPS growth. But I want to be clear, what our investors expect is that we continue to deliver year after years. That's 21 years; we've now industry-leading or consistent industry-leading financial performance, time and time again. And then compounding off actuals, which gives you a better quality of earnings, that's what our investors inspect, that's what we expect and that's what we deliver. And so by providing some insights to those tailwinds, I just -- you get some idea of the momentum and how we can again strengthen our confidence in delivering this and just doing it year after year, exactly what our investors expect. But certainly, Rejji, I'm sure we want to walk in and offer some commentary on this as well. Good morning, Ross. Let me offer the two mechanisms that we have to consider what I'd call supply type assets. One is the renewable energy plan, which we'll file here November 15 in that range around that date. And that will lay out some of the renewable energy assets we need, both -- it will build off the foundation of our 2021 integrated resource plan, but then there's two tranches as I see it of additional renewable energy, that will show up in the terms of meeting the 50% standard of renewable assets for 2030 as well as 60% for 2035. That's really tranche one. And then there was additional renewable assets as a result of economic development and growth, the demand growth that we've seen. So that's a nice piece of work, a nice tailwind. There will be some reference to storage in there as part of that. But where more of the storage will play out is in our 2026 integrated resource plan. That's where we look at the capacity mix. That's where we look at the reliability of supply. That's where we'll look at those important components. In the degree, there's additional tax incentives or benefit that will play out in that process and that selection process. I do anticipate that there's going to need to be quite a bit of storage on the system, maybe even more than what is referenced in the law, but that's certainly a nice pathway to get things started with the certainty of the legislation. So hopefully, that's -- that's helpful. Will do, yes. Our process has been with DIG to just layer these in over time. That's really a de-risking mechanism for us. And certainly, the sometimes where we might strike at a price point that's a little lower than the future, but there are times where it's going to strike at a price point that's a little higher than the future. And so we've had that approach. It really de-risks and becomes a predictable source of earnings by taking that -- these bilateral contracts or just kind of layer in minimum over time. Thank you. Keep it going. Thank you. The short answer is yes, but let me explain more. In the renewable energy plan, we'll start out with the base or the foundation is really the 2021 integrated resource plan, which you'll remember calls for 8 gigawatts of solar and we've built some renewables as part of that as well. So that's the foundation. The first piece will -- the 2021 IRP did not get us to 50% renewables by 2030 or the 60% number by 2035. So there's some renewables that will have to be constructed or through a PPA with an FCM, that will have to happen. That's tranche one. The second tranche is specifically because there's additional sales expected as a result of economic development. And so we forecast that out over 20 years, and so we do have visibility to it. But we have to have certainty around it as well. So these are items that we are -- have high confidence around, and we have signed contracts around. This is not the pipeline or some hypothetical numbers. It's -- again, a reflection of what's coming to the state in terms of -- so we have to answer question directly, yes, visibility of that. That will also drive additional renewable assets or purchase power agreements to meet that need as well. So if you continue to follow that down, I expect it to be a mix of solar and wind that will make that up. And then, of course, we'll talk about more details of that at EEI as we file that. So that's part one. The second part that I would also is the IRP. And remember, renewable energy plan just deals with energy. You have to deal with the capacity; you have to do with the reliability of supply. You also have the opportunity to accommodate additional sales growth. That will show up in the integrated resource plan as well. So I assume it's two mechanisms -- two opportunities where we'll see those tailwinds of again, ownership of assets, investments to deliver clean energy on behalf of our customers or through a PPA with the financial compensation mechanism. I anticipate that we'll take the Liberty audit findings and weave them into our five-year reliability plan, which will, of course, enhance that plan, provide opportunities for additional capital investments to again address reliability for our customers proactively offering better service and lower cost. So that will be part of it. I anticipate there will be additional tree trimming or operation and maintenance expect that we've woven into the plan as well as part of this Liberty audit. And as the commission -- one of the actions that the commission has already taken is a performance-based ratemaking that's focused on reliability work. And so I anticipate that's woven into this work as well. I don't think it holds us up from making these important investments. And we're making them now and seeing good performance improvement in terms of reliability and we just need to continue to do that important work. Rejji will walk through the numbers in a moment. Let me just start out by saying staff's position as a constructive starting point. And as I shared in my prepared remarks, there's a number of things that have been supported in SaaS position. But there are some distribution investments for our customers that have, I would say, been left on the table. And we're focused on improving reliability. We know we can do that, offer better service. We're proving that out by our five-year plan, and we can do that at a lower cost, doing it proactively versus reactively. And so in addition to the storm recovery mechanism, which you referenced, which is also referenced in the Liberty audit as well. But we're also focused on those distribution investments to offer better service for our customers. And so there's a bit of advocacy we are doing on behalf of our customers. So we can make those investments to improve service. That is also a component which may push us into an adjudicated order. But I'll remind everybody, I'm open to settlement. It's just going to have to have -- it's going to have to continue to be more than where the staff is currently at. But Rejji, just share with Mike where things are at from a cost perspective. And just to offer some numbers, our staff is at $170 million at a 9.5% ROE, 49.9% equity ratio. And our rebuttal position, we're at $277 million at 10.25% ROE, 50.75% equity ratio. So a little bit of cost of capital difference there as well. But I wanted to just make sure, Michael, you had the revised position of the company. They're not supportive of it, but again, not supportive, but we expected that. Just like the investment recovery mechanism, it had to go to the commission. And we anticipate some mechanism like this will require the commission to weigh in on. And so it's not a surprise we're to ask that. And again, if we're going to go after that, it's going to go likely to a full order. You're welcome. Have a great day, Mike. Yes. We're in that window now. And so -- and really up to a final order as the window of opportunity for us. And so -- and we'll look -- again, we'll look, I'm always open to settlement. I've said that in calls before. If we can make things work for our customers and for all stakeholders, I mean that's a good place to be. There's just a couple of things in this case that may force us into a full order, and we just want to make sure everyone on the call is aware of that. Rejji and I'll tag team this one, but I want to remind you that many of the tailwinds that we described in this call come as a result of approval of the renewable energy plan or approval of the IRP. And so although we'll file it in November of this year, fast-forward 10 months. So it's going to be in late Q3 of 2025 before we see where the commission is at with that. And so I wouldn't expect some of that good work to show up until our Q4 call at the end of 2025, early part of 2026. And then you'd have the same cycle for the IRP, which would start in 2026 and then play out in 2027. So I see these as tranches that go over time over the five years. Clearly, there's some tailwinds here, but they show up at different points in time. But I'll turn it over to Rejji to offer some additional color. Well, let me offer you this and then we'll talk a little bit about the mix from MISO and the like. After our 2021 integrated resource plan, we were along from a capacity perspective. And there was a couple of things. One, we kept additional assets available to us as part of the settlement. We acquired the Covert Generating facility was 1.2 gigawatts. In the meantime, since 2022, when that was approved, we've also built out renewable assets, both wind and solar, and both here some PPAs as well as some owned assets. And so that's actually put in a position where we've been long and we've been able to accommodate a lot of sales growth. And then, as a reminder, we have the mechanisms, both the renewable energy plan and the integrated resource plan with some flexibility in those because we look at them -- two years on a renewable energy plan basis every three to five on an integrated resource plan, but we can pull it up and adjust those as needed to be able to accommodate the additional growth. The third piece with these hyperscalers is working with them because they're not going to all come on immediately. And they have plans and when they want to ramp up. That's also true with manufacturing. And so they may need a starting load in 2026, but their full ramp-up doesn't get out to 2028, 2029, 2030. And so there's a lot of work that we do with the customers to make sure we get that right. And so there's a lot of flexibility we have to make sure the supply and demand stack match up nicely and we can grow Michigan in the state. Now, we do leverage MISO to be able to do that. And if you look at our total mix, it's about 46%, 40-ish, 5% that we either have through PPAs or through purchase off market. Remember those PPAs act as both capacity and energy as well in that mix. And then the rest is self-generated. The short answer is yes. And we work closely with customers to be able to do that. I'll give you a real example. And it just hit the press today, we talked about in Q1, but we couldn't name the company. Switch, which is an existing data center in Michigan, is expanding by 230 megawatts. They want to be up by full load in 2026. We're able to do that. We're able to deliver that, as the electric infrastructure, both with our transmission partner and the distribution infrastructure as well as ensuring we have the supply. And so that gives you a little nature of our ability to deliver on that. And as we other -- entertain other hyperscalers or other manufacturing, again, we work with them closely to match up the ramp-up schedule. I gave the example of Corning as well in my prepared remarks. Corning wants to out low down by the first quarter of 2025. We're constructing the substation right now. We will deliver that. But again they want to ramp up. They go from a small amount of megawatts up to 90, 95 megawatts. That quarter is over a year. And so we pace that along with that company. So those are two real examples, real work going on in the state and just gives you an idea of how we work with customers to grow Michigan and grow in our service territory. We welcome growth in Michigan. I mean there's nothing better than create jobs. And we've got a constructive -- I mean, we're doing a lot of onshoring. It is truly a manufacturing renaissance. We're certainly open for data centers as well. And we work with those customers, large sites, small sites, to create opportunity for all stakeholders in the state. And so it doesn't -- we don't back away from a gigawatt load. Some of those are on one site; some of those are across multiple sites. And it's really, again, working with that company on their ramp-up schedule and when do we need to provide that and match that supply/demand mix. We've been doing this for 135 years. I used to be -- I started out my business -- in the business, I should say, on the supply side. So I get this. And that's what we do as a load serving entity; we have the mechanisms within the construct to be able to do that with success. One of it is contractually, but it's also, as I shared in my earlier remarks, making sure we've got a good -- from a rate design perspective, a cost of service model. That's how we operate in the State of Michigan. And so that makes sure that the other customers aren't subsidizing that work. And as I shared, we're working closely with commission and commission staff with data centers to see if there's additional rate compact or construct to be able to further ensure that residential customers aren't subsidizing or putting the bill for the data centers. Yes, see you in Hollywood Thanks, Harry. And I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you at EEI, take care and stay safe."

The Earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time running through August 1. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Show, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations.\nJason Shore: Thank you, Harry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Garrick.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our proven investment thesis, which delivers 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth and affordable bills for our customers has been durable for more than two decades because we focus on what matters. Today, I'm going to highlight two key areas of our thesis. First, Michigan's strong regulatory environment. Built on a solid constructive framework, much of which is codified in Michigan law, 10-month forward-looking rate cases, important financial and fuel recovery mechanisms increased energy waste reduction incentives just to name a few attributes. This robust framework supports Michigan's position as a top-tier regulatory environment and provides supportive incentives for needed investments to make our electric and gas systems safer, more reliable and resilient and cleaner. And second, our continued commitment to affordable bills for our customers. As I've said before, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments and we keep customer build affordable. I consider our use of the CE Way, our lean operating system, one of the best in the industry. This approach limits upward pressure on customer bills. It is critical in the delivery of our investment plan. And we continue to see a long runway of cost-saving opportunities well into the future, delivering industry-leading results for all our stakeholders. From a regulatory perspective, we're off to a strong start for the year. As you can see on Slide 4, our regulatory calendar is mostly complete. We received a constructive order in our electric rate case in March, filed our new electric rate case in May and settled our gas rate case earlier this month, the fourth consecutive settlement in our gas business, four consecutive settlements in gas, yet another proof point highlighting the strong regulatory environment in Michigan. We're very pleased with our recently approved gas settlement, which calls for a $62.5 million of effective rate relief, a 9.9% ROE and a 50% equity ratio. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. Outside of rate cases, our upcoming 20-year renewable energy plan or our EP filing in November is the only major remaining filing for the year. Let me pause there for a moment. Midway through the year. our financial-related regulatory outcomes are known. This is a great place to be. I also want to talk about our formula to deliver customer affordability as we make important investments. Long-term filings, like our renewable energy plan detail the significant planned investments that support safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy for our customers. As we shared previously, we see more investment opportunities as we make the transition to renewables and clean energy. In addition to the $17 billion of needed customer investments in our 5-year capital plan, our electric reliability road map and natural gas delivery plans highlight important investments well beyond within our financial plan. Now that's a long way of saying we see a long runway of necessary and important customer investments. These investments must be balanced with a laser focus on customer affordability. We take seriously our ability to create capital headroom to make those investments through continued use of the CE Way, which provides over $50 million of annual customer savings. Renegotiating over market PPAs in retiring our coal facilities, which together provide well over $200 million in savings as we transition toward cleaner resources. Capitalizing on economic development opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, which brings jobs and significant mission investments, spreading fixed costs over a larger customer base, benefiting all customers. Lastly, leveraging our best-in-class energy waste reduction programs to help customers reduce bills. This is a formula that works for everyone, continuing to strengthen the system with important investments while keeping customer bills affordable. Now let's look at the results and outlook. For the first half, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63, up $0.18 versus the first half of 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full year guidance remained at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji.\nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first six months of 2024 and our year ago expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the first half of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $485 million or $1.63 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023, largely due to higher rate relief net of investment costs. And while we have seen some glimpses of favorable weather, particularly in June, overall weather continues to be a headwind through the first half of the year, equating to $0.05 per share of negative variance and that figure includes the warm winter weather experience in our service territory in the first quarter, which I'll remind you, have the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. As mentioned, rate relief, net investment-related expenses, one of the key drivers of our first half performance resulted in $0.13 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order received in March and last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year was negatively impacted by heavy storm activity, including a notable weather system that impacted our service territory in late June resulted in $0.03 per share, a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.13 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch-off bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at NorthStar and higher weather-normalized electric sales. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.20 per share of positive variance for the remaining half of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the final six months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.12 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which Garrick summarized earlier. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way and the residual benefits from select sustainable cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023 such as our voluntary separation plan, among others. Collectively, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share, a positive variance for the remaining six months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other IOs. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.35 to $0.41 per share of negative variance. In summary, despite a challenging first half of the year, we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2024, which at this point are limited to debt issuances at the utility. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financing of the utility. Specifically, we are now planning to issue approximately $675 million in the second half of the year versus the implied estimates in our original guidance of $500 million to rebalance the rate-making capital structure at the utility in accordance with recent rate case outcomes. Although not highlighted in the table on the slide, I'm pleased to report that we have completed all of our planned tax credit sales for the year at levels favorable to our plan and ahead of schedule. I'll also reiterate that we have no planned long-term financings as apparent in 2024, but remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session.\nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance. I have confidence in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis, and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeremy Tonet: Just wanted to turn towards DIG for a little bit here if we could. And just wanted to get updated thoughts with regards to recontracting overall and just, I guess, the outlook in this environment, given kind of trends in power prices?\nGarrick Rochow: I would suggest, Jeremy, it's consistent with what we shared in the past, energy and capacity markets that upward pressure continues to be a ripe opportunity and we continue to strike nice bilateral contracts to secure managing capacity prices well above our plan. And so again, it's a good opportunity to continue to do that. And as we've shared in the past, this just continues to strengthen and lengthen our financial performance.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Thank you for that. And then it seems like halfway through the year, CMS is in a pretty good position overall. Just wondering any thoughts, you could share with regards to, I guess, how weather is looking in impacts for 3Q as it stands right now and really getting towards, I guess, cost management thoughts and whether there might be in a position to pull forward costs to further derisk the future outlook and how you think about all of that?\nRejji Hayes : Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. I would say weather outlook looks fairly good for Q3, but obviously, early days. And I will just say, personally, I don't give a lot of credence to 2-month and 3-month outlooks. I'm much more focused on the 10 days ahead, which appear to be a bit more accurate. And so, we always remain paranoid about weather. And just based on year-to-date, weather has not been all that kind. And so, we'll continue to execute on cost performance-related initiatives. We've had some good success over the last several years in executing on cost management over the course of the year, and we'll continue to do that through Q3. As I mentioned in the first quarter call, it's still premature to start thinking about pull aheads for 2025. I'd say historically, even in the best of years, where weather was really helpful in the first couple of quarters, we still didn't think about flexing up or pull ahead or any of those types of derisking mechanisms until we got deeper into Q3 and had a real good outlook on the fourth quarter. So hopefully, more to talk about from a 2025 derisking perspective next quarter. But at this point, it's too premature to get into that.\nGarrick Rochow: And if I could just add to that, Jeremy, part of the call here in my prepared remarks, I talked about the confidence. Confidence comes from the fact that we're executing on the CE Way. We've done that historically. We typically have been at a run rate of greater than $50 million on an annual basis. We see that continuing. There are a number of things that we did in 2023 in terms of -- already Ready shared in his prepared remarks, voluntary separation, contract control as those continue to yield benefit in the year. And also, we're flying a lot of digital solutions, everything from work in the field to automate work, all the way into the office, things like work management that continue to provide additional cost savings in the year. So again, confident as I shared in the call here earlier, and delivering guidance for the year.\nJeremy Tonet: Got it. Appreciate it. And then if I could just wrap with thoughts on opportunity to service data centers going forward here, and I guess, the interplay with regards to legislation in Michigan, whether that comes to fruition and how that might impact the pace of such type of development.\nGarrick Rochow: Jeremy, you know us well enough the Hayes-Rochow team here. We're pretty conservative in our approach to financials. And as I shared in the Q1 call, we want to make sure it's signed on the dotted line, you might say, before we talk about it. So, we don't inflate our sales forecast. I would just say that there's a lot of interest in both manufacturing and data centers in the state as I shared in the Q1 call, seeing a lot of manufacturing growth. That continues into Q2. We saw data centers, we talked about one that we signed in Q1, 230 megawatts. There continues to be strong interest in the state, both the hyperscalers and also, we're seeing some growth in what I call, midscalers from a data center perspective, those continue to move forward regardless of legislation in the state. And so, the sales and use tax piece will continue in the conversation in the legislature. But again, it's a bit of Jerry on top of Sunday, you might say.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nShahriar Pourreza : So, I know you guys noted previously that the FCM mechanism could be incremental sort of in the new generation not in plan. As we're kind of getting closer to the November rep filing, any thoughts on where demand is headed and how maybe CMS would be positioned for upside there. So, any thoughts on incremental CapEx versus the PPA options? Have you started to embed any higher load growth in your assumptions?\nGarrick Rochow: Sure. I was really hoping for a rate design question.\nShahriar Pourreza: It's coming. That's my follow-up.\nGarrick Rochow: Let's talk about this. We definitely see as a part of this energy law, additional upside. That shows up in ownership of asset that shows up in the financial compensation mechanism, both those are true. Let me talk about how they'll play out, though. We're going to file this our renewable energy plan in November, it's a 10-month process. So, we'll know in 2025, kind of latter half of the year, what that looks like. And so, in our 2026 capital plan, you'll see what that means, our 2026 financials both from an FCM perspective as well as what might the ownership mix looks like. And so that's where it will play out. In addition to that, that's probably a portion of the story because in 2026, we'll also file our integrated resource plan, which we'll talk about some of the reliability pieces and some of the work to deliver the capacity component of that. So, between '26, '27, '28, I think that's when you'll see the capital impact as well as the financial compensation mechanism play out in terms of our financials. And I will say this, we've seen some good economic growth in the state. That will show up in our renewable energy plan. We're definitely seeing a greater need than was in our original 2021 IRP. So, I'll leave it at that. And certainly, that will provide additional upside opportunity in terms of capital growth in addition to the energy law.\nShahriar Pourreza: And then just a quick follow-up, and I obviously dedicate this to Garrick. Just on the rate case filing on the electric side, obviously, it's in the early innings. It's kind of more of a '25 event. The provisions and sort of the mechanisms like the IRM and DR remain unchanged. I guess do you feel there would be sort of an opportunity for settlement after testimony given this is kind of a less complex case. I guess, how are you sort of thinking about settlement path versus the prior litigated path? And is there anything, and I dedicate this to you, any of the rate design stuff in there that can cause some contention?\nGarrick Rochow: I set myself up for that one, didn't I? [indiscernible] here on this call. I will always look for settlement opportunities. I'm also very confident in our team. We put a great case together, and we can go to full distance, just as we did this year in our March order. And so, when I think about this electric rate case, there's some things that have to be figured out to really get some context around the opportunity for settlement. One, I think it's really important to understand that electric cases are more complex than gas cases. So, for example, we had less than 10 intervenors in our gas case. We have a little over 20 in our electric case. That's not abnormal, it's just, it's a more complex case. There's more interested party so we have to navigate through that. I also think it's important to find where staff is and where the Attorney General are at in this case. That will come in September. These are important points to know in the context of settlement opportunity. But I understand that, I am very confident in this case. It is focused on electric reliability. That's well aligned with what the customers are asking for, what the commissioners and the staff are asking for and what I've committed to do and so this case has great capital investments and undergrounding has important work hardening the system and automated transfer reclosures technology on the system. There's important work in O&M and tree trimming, our number one cause of outage and other important maintenance work across the system. We're going to leverage the infrastructure recovery mechanism, we'll certainly look for -- we're going to try another store mechanism in this case as well. And so, we feel confident in our ability to get the very constructive outcome, just given how well aligned we are across commission staff as well as our customers. So hopefully, that gives you some context on the case. Now on rate design, let me just talk a little bit about rate design. Specifically, data centers are not at our economic development rate. We had ex-parte filing that made an adjustment in that, that was approved. And so, in the meantime, they are an industrial rate. We thought our GDP rate and what that does is a better balance, both capacity and energy cost, the cost to serve those customers. The commission as well as the utility has been looking and exploring at the opportunity specific data center rate. But in the interest of time, the GDP is a good proxy for that in our mind. And so well suited from a rate design perspective, from a data center perspective. I also said GDP, I think that's the wrong thing. I was hoping for something different there. Maybe that was -- but GPD is what I meant -- sorry about that Shahriar I had my eyes on the economic [indiscernible] it's election time. I have my mind on other things like what's going to happen with our economy.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Michael Sullivan of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Sullivan: I just wanted to go back to the data center legislation discussion. I think on the last call, you talked about a 230-megawatt data center coming in 2026. Was that contingent on the legislation or your understanding is still moving forward? And are there any other examples of that? Or is everyone else [indiscernible] weighted inflation?\nGarrick Rochow: It was not contingent. That one is still moving forward, that's the signed piece. And that's -- I guess that's my point. What we hear from data centers, it's more important about how fast can you get transmission here, how much cash can you build that conversion from transmission distribution to substation, how fast can you get supply here, and we're able to do that. And so many of those mid scalers and hyperscalers continue to make forward steps regardless of the progress on the sales new stack. And just to give you a little context, at the end of the spring session, the legislature was focused on the state budget. In the words of our governor, we've got to fix the damn road, and we got to fund schools, right? And so those are important things, too. I don't want -- we want smart kids in the state. So those are important things underway. That conversation on data centers and the sales tax will continue into the fall. Now we're in elections. So, it will be difficult for me to predict how fast that will move or it could happen to [indiscernible]. And so, we'll continue that conversation in the state. But again, it's not stopping things for moving forward, Michael.\nMichael Sullivan: And is that like a good proxy for how long it takes new load to come on to your system about two years with that one being 2026?\nGarrick Rochow: There's a number of variables there, Mike. So, in the case of that data center, what we talked about is they're bringing on load by 2025, 2026, and where they're located on the system makes a big difference. And so able to accommodate that. Depending on where the data center is located from a property perspective makes a difference. Just as far as how far do we have to extend lines, is it greenfield? there's all kinds of variables that go into it, but we're in that two to three years cycle. And again, even if you're at the tail end of that cycle, data centers are moving quickly, and that doesn't seem to be holding them up too much.\nMichael Sullivan: Okay great. And then separately, just kind of sticking with legislation. I think there were some comments a few months ago from the PSC chair about rate case time lines being a bit impressed these days. Are you hearing any chance of legislation coming up that would revert back to 12 months per cycle from -- and just a general sense for rate fatigue in the state in light of those comments?\nGarrick Rochow: The short answer is no. As you know, what makes Michigan great is much of the regulatory environment is set in law. So, 10-month forward-looking rate cases is in the law, financial compensation mechanism, energy efficiency incentives are in the law. And we just went through that law. We just opened and it was just signed here last November, and we're hearing nothing in terms of holding that law back up or looking at different traditions. Now we continue to always have a constructive dialogue with the commission and the staff. And so, I do think there are opportunities right, in terms. And so, I'll give you one example, just one example of probably many you could think about. We have a great process for an integrated resource plan and a renewable energy plan that lay out an energy supply portfolio. So, we get it preapproved and then it flows into rate cases. It really streamlines rate cases. What if we could do the same thing on the distribution system, wouldn\u2019t that be great? Let's build a 5-year reliability road map. Wait, we've already done that. Let's do that. Let's approve that and then have that flow into rate cases. That could really streamline the process. And it's done in the right way, you can potentially see a path where you could stay out for a period of time, again, done in the right way. And so, the kind of the nature of Michigan's constructive regulatory environment, let's explore that. Let's see if there's opportunities there to -- even for the bolstered Michigan constructive nature.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Andrew Weisel of Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Weisel: Just two quick ones. First, C&I weather-adjusted volumes were down in the quarter, it's a bit of a reversal from the first quarter. I know the first quarter was extremely mild weather. So those numbers are probably a little bit goofy. But any commentary on the underlying trends and the near-term outlook for the rest of this year, maybe early thoughts on 2025?\nRejji Hayes: Sure, Andrew. This is Rejji. I'll take, and I appreciate the question as always. Yes, we did see a little bit of a pullback in Q2 versus Q2 of last year for weather normalized sales for electric. I will always caveat and I think you alluded to it that it's a very imperfect science, and the team does a really good job trying to pull these numbers together with real accuracy. But again, it's very difficult to get real precision here. Just so everybody is grounded residential for the quarter versus Q2 of 2023, which is slightly up about 0.1%. And commercial down about 1 point, industrial down about 2 points, excluding on low-margin customer and an all-in blended was down about 1 point and so that is to your comment, unfavorable from the trends we were seeing in the first quarter. But I would say, on a year-to-date basis, the trend remains quite good, and we continue to be surprised for the upside really across all customer classes because our assumptions were incredibly conservative as they always are for the year. And so, we are outperforming across every customer class, what our initial expectations were that were embedded in our original guidance. And so, we are still seeing non-weather sales upside. I'll also note, as I've said before, that we had energy waste reduction incorporated into all of those numbers that you're seeing. And so, you should always add 2% to each of those customer classes because we're delivering the 2% reduction across every customer class year-over-year, and we've been doing that now really since the '08 law or thereabouts. And so, another way to think about those numbers I just quoted that you should add or gross up 2% across each of those, if you want to get the underlying economic conditions. So, we still remain quite good. And then we still remain quite pleased rather with the results. And then when you think about it on a year-to-date basis, where is up about 1 point. Commercial is up over 1%, industrial down about 1 point and all in is up about a little over 0.5%. So again, all things considered, particularly when you gross up for energy waste reduction, we think conditions in Michigan remain quite good really across all customer classes. Was that helpful?\nAndrew Weisel : Yes. Good reminder on the efficiency. And yes, we all know that you're conservative. Next, an operational question. You noted there was some heavy storm activity in the quarter, what kind of score or grade would you give yourself in terms of restoration efforts? Reliability is obviously a big focus for you. You talked about that in your comments, what would you say went well? What could have gone better? And how does this fold into your efforts as part of the electric rate case and the audit?\nGarrick Rochow: So, we're seeing a number of great improvements as a result of the investments we have made to date. More needs to be done along those lines. And so, in fairness, I'd give ourselves a B in the context, there's more needs to be done for our customers. And that's evident in the rate case filing that we're doing. Where we've worked a lot, this year is reducing the size of the outage. And so, we've put in a lot of fusing. So, what I mean by that is you have less customers impacted when the tree comes down the line, that's an important work. We've more than doubled our free trimming work over the last three years. That's also provided a benefit when we trim treating there, we see a greater than 60% reduction in the number of outages. You may ask why not 100% because we still see trees outside the right way that impacts our performance. But I would also put it into context, Rejji talked about the last week of June, and there was a larger event in June, but there was a lot more smaller events which we would anticipate. We're trying to shrink the size, which makes restoration easier, but a lot of pockets throughout the state. We brought in a number of resources. We leverage a lot of our existing union resources to be able to respond to that, and we have good response from that perspective. We measure in terms of restoring our customers within a 24-hour window. We want to have all customers restored within a 24-hour window. And last year, in 2023, we're at 90% within a 24-hour window. This year, we're upwards of 95%. And so that shows the directional improvement. Now the year is not done. We've got a lot of work to do. and we'll continue to make some important investments throughout this year. And again, this electric rate case shows the path for more. So hopefully it gives us some context. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well.\nRejji Hayes: Andrew, all I would add to Garrick's good comments on the operational side is really applying a financial lens. And I would give us about a B+ on the financial side because through utilization of the CE Way, we've done a really good job reducing unit cost in our actual service restoration. And we're seeing at this point over $40 million of avoided costs. Now needless to say, I talked about negative variance attributable to overall service restoration costs versus last year. However, the cost would have been decidedly higher as in the problem-solving we've done throughout the year. And so, we're contracting third parties more efficiently. We're using more automation to reduce manual inspections and definitely leveraging the tools of the CE Way to really execute on storm restoration much more efficiently than we have in the past. And so, in addition to all the operational feat that Garrick highlighted, will also apply a really thoughtful financial lens as well as to make sure that we're bringing customers back online as quickly as possible and as quickly as possible and as cost efficiently as possible. So, I'd be remiss if I didn't add that as well.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Julian Dimelo Smith [Indiscernible] of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Garrick, what are you put in your -- when are you putting yourself in the ring here for VP given all the political conversation here, right? Now you want to fix them growth.\nGarrick Rochow: And here's Rochow. I don't know. I don't know if it has a ring to it. Look I'll give it a try.\nUnidentified Analyst : Anyway, I -- look, you guys are really -- you got your front foot forward here for sure. Look, you favorably have pulled back on O&M savings here you're talking about leaning in, being in a good position against near-term and longer-term targets you issued more debt, I think it was $675 million versus the $500 million to rebalance your equity ratio. What's driving this level of outperformance? But I just want to try to clarify like the debt signaling as well as just overall the commentary, especially considering the O&M factor that you flag here. Like typically, you lead with costs, but I'm wondering what other factors there are.\nRejji Hayes: Julian, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question and welcome back. Really good to hear your voice. Let me start with a few of the just premises or working assumptions you offered up in the question. And so, let me start with the debt at the utility, just for factual purposes. And so, we are planning to issue about $675 million in the second half of the year at the utility as part of our financing plan. It was initially $0.5 billion and so we've slightly increased, and that's really just because of our rate case outcomes, which had modestly lower equity levels, and so we'll have more debt at the operating company. And so, I just want to make sure that, that was abundantly clear. And obviously, we'll look to execute on that financing as cost-efficiently as possible, and we'll be thoughtful about maturity profile as well. The outperformance has been, obviously, we always try to deliver on the cost performance side. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, rate relief net of investments has been helpful getting constructive orders the electric rate order in early March, the gas rate case last year, we're still seeing the residual benefits from that. And so that's really what's helped us in the first half of the year. And also, though it's embedded in that catch-all bucket, as I noted in my prepared remarks, NorthStar has really outperformed. They had a really soft comp in the first half of 2023, just given last year's plan was a bit more back-end loaded. And there were also some outage-related issues at DIG, given a transformer issue. And so, this year, they've really gotten out of the gate pretty strong. DIG is up about $0.05 year-over-year, and we're seeing the residual benefits from some solar projects that came in late last year. And so, I'd say it's a combination of rate relief net of investments, outperformance at NorthStar as well as some cost performance, as you alluded to, offset by mild weather conditions, which have hurt the top line as well as storms, as we talked about in the prior question. So, I'd say it's a combination of all of that, which gives us just good confidence going into the second half of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst : And Rejji, just to follow-up on that real quick. A lot of that dynamic with NorthStar, some of it is true up there. You talk about outages year-over-year. You should -- in theory, some of that should have been expected, the solar in service mean I'm curious, the outperformance here. I mean, is this more of a true-up? Or is there sort of a compounding effect across the subsequent years? How do you think about the leading indicators there?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, good question. NorthStar on plan. We anticipated a front-end loaded year for all of the reasons you noted. So, a good portion of NorthStar's performance was on plan. But I will say DIG did surprised a little bit to the upside in the first quarter because operationally, not only are they executing very well, but they're also executing on a lower unit cost basis, which drives a little bit of additional margin there also opportunities for off-peak margin that the team has capitalized on. So, I'd say it's a combination of being on plan because it was a front-end loaded plant at NorthStar, but also so operational efficiency, which we've seen. So that's really the thrust of it at NorthStar.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Durgesh Chopra of Evercore. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- all my other questions have been answered. I just wanted to see if there's an update on the performance-based ratemaking dotted here coming out of the legislation last year. Where do we stand there? Can you just update us on that, please?\nGarrick Rochow: Sure. That's been a very constructive dialogue. As I've shared in the past, it started really wide in the number of metrics. And then through good dialogue, it was narrowed down to a nice four benchmarkable metrics. It's grown a little bit to accommodate some storm provisions. However, there's still a constructive dialogue underway here in July and August, there's filings to be able to navigate that. There's a few things we still want to work through and get -- Dot the Is and Check the Ts on you might say. And then I expect that this is going to play out over several rate cases. And so, it's not going to be implemented here immediately. I think it just speaks to the constructive dialogue we have in Michigan here. A lot of good interveners and filings that go back and forth to really make sure it's going to be a productive ratemaking mechanism.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So just kind of the framework of this would be a potential earnings uplift. And then on the downside, a potential penalty on certain metrics. And then when did you say this could go into effect? This is a '25 Item, '26? Just any thoughts there?\nGarrick Rochow: I would put it several rate cases away, so over maybe a year or two years out from an implementation perspective. Again, that's my view, just what I see of the world. The intent is for it to be symmetric. And so, there's upside opportunity and downside opportunity. The downside opportunity is market about $10 million at this context, which is manageable in the context of the year. That means the upside opportunity is roughly that same amount. And at least that is proposed currently.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from the line of Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTravis Miller: Very high level on electric demand. I wonder if you could elaborate on how it's trending versus your 2021 IRP and how, as you had mentioned earlier in the call, how that would affect potentially the renewable energy plan filing here. They're trending higher or lower and how does that impact the REP?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes. It's definitely trending higher based on all the economic development activity that is, again, not speculating on that, that is signed or -- and we're out building substations and there's transmission being built to serve these customers. And so, in our renewable energy plan filing, you should anticipate that there's additional sales reference there above and beyond our 2021 IRP.\nTravis Miller: And is it fair to make the leap then that you would need more renewable energy on that same percentage basis as what's in the lot?\nGarrick Rochow: Yes, generally speaking.\nTravis Miller: Okay. And then also, obviously, a lot to talk about in the media about Palisades. From your perspective, is it accurate that you're seeing development moving forward on that plant? And then if so, would you be interested in either implementing that in your plan in terms of the capacity and energy and/or signing a PPA?\nGarrick Rochow: Palisade is making forward progress in the state. From a state budget perspective, another $150 million was allocated toward the forward direction of the facility. We're having public meetings that are going on right now on site. So again, forward steps and moving forward that plant. Now I remind you that a PPA has already been struck for the offtake from the Palisades facility that goes to a co-op in Michigan and a co-op in Indiana. So, it's already spoken for. Now we did -- it's good for Michigan that Palisade is returning. And we, at CMS Energy, do not see any adverse impact as a result of Palisade coming back.\nOperator: Our next question today is from the line of Nick Campanella of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNick Campanella: Just one for me today. So, I know, Rejji, you said you would be opportunistic in your prepared remarks around financing and potentially pulling things forward from '25. I'm just cognizant that you do have kind of you start to issue equity in 2025. And maybe you can just kind of give us some more color? Are you just kind of talking about pulling forward hybrid or debt or is everything on the table, how do you think about that?\nRejji Hayes: Yes, I appreciate the question, Nick. I would say in short, I wouldn't say everything is on the table. So, you won't see us issuing equity in 2024. We have done in the past, though, as we have executed on forward opportunistically to at least take some of the price risk off the table. And I would say where the equity is today. I don't think that seems like the most likely trade. But I was speaking more towards parent debt financing needs. And certainly, our thinking is quite expensive, everything from senior notes to hybrids and those types of securities, all of which we've done pretty opportunistically in the past. As you may recall, we've got about $250 million coming due at the holdco next year. And so, we're mindful that we have, I'd say, modest new money needs on top of that. And so, we will see if there's good pricing in the market, particularly if the speculation around potential dovish policy -- dovish monetary policy from the Fed comes to fruition, but I have stopped wagering on that. So, we'll see what happens. But if we start to see a correction in the yield curve that's favorable and it creates opportunities for holdco debt financings. We'll look to do that. And again, I'd say the equity need still as is up to $350 million starting next year, and I don't see us pulling any of that forward.\nOperator: With no further questions in the queue at this time, I would like to hand the call back to Mr. Garrick Rochow for any closing remarks.\nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Harry. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. We thank everyone for your participation.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the first six months of 2024 and our year ago expectations. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a year-to-date and a year-to-go basis. In summary, through the first half of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $485 million or $1.63 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023, largely due to higher rate relief net of investment costs. And while we have seen some glimpses of favorable weather, particularly in June, overall weather continues to be a headwind through the first half of the year, equating to $0.05 per share of negative variance and that figure includes the warm winter weather experience in our service territory in the first quarter, which I'll remind you, have the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. As mentioned, rate relief, net investment-related expenses, one of the key drivers of our first half performance resulted in $0.13 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our electric rate order received in March and last year's gas rate case settlement. From a cost perspective, our financial performance in the first half of the year was negatively impacted by heavy storm activity, including a notable weather system that impacted our service territory in late June resulted in $0.03 per share, a negative variance versus the comparable period in 2023. Rounding out the first six months of the year, you'll note the $0.13 per share of positive variance highlighted in the catch-off bucket in the middle of the chart. The primary sources of upside here were related to solid operational performance at NorthStar and higher weather-normalized electric sales. Looking ahead, as always, we plan for normal weather, which equates to $0.20 per share of positive variance for the remaining half of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced in the final six months of 2023. From a regulatory perspective, we'll realize $0.12 per share of positive variance, largely driven by the aforementioned electric rate order received from the commission earlier this year and the constructive outcome achieved in our recently approved gas rate case settlement, which Garrick summarized earlier. Closing out the glide path for the remainder of the year, as noted during our Q1 call, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way and the residual benefits from select sustainable cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023 such as our voluntary separation plan, among others. Collectively, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share, a positive variance for the remaining six months of the year. Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance, which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other IOs. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.35 to $0.41 per share of negative variance. In summary, despite a challenging first half of the year, we are well-positioned to deliver on our 2024 financial objectives to the benefit of customers and investors. Moving on to our financing plan. Slide 8 offers more specificity on the balance of our planned funding needs in 2024, which at this point are limited to debt issuances at the utility. I'll bring to your attention a relatively modest increase to our 2024 planned financing of the utility. Specifically, we are now planning to issue approximately $675 million in the second half of the year versus the implied estimates in our original guidance of $500 million to rebalance the rate-making capital structure at the utility in accordance with recent rate case outcomes. Although not highlighted in the table on the slide, I'm pleased to report that we have completed all of our planned tax credit sales for the year at levels favorable to our plan and ahead of schedule. I'll also reiterate that we have no planned long-term financings as apparent in 2024, but remain opportunistic should we see a cost-efficient opportunity to pull ahead some of our 2025 financing needs. As I've said before, our approach to our financing plan is similar to how we run the business. We plan conservatively and capitalize on opportunities as they arise. This approach has been tried and true year in and year out and has enabled us to deliver on our operational and financial objectives, irrespective of the circumstances to the benefit of our customers and investors, and this year is no different. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Jeremy, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question. I would say weather outlook looks fairly good for Q3, but obviously, early days. And I will just say, personally, I don't give a lot of credence to 2-month and 3-month outlooks. I'm much more focused on the 10 days ahead, which appear to be a bit more accurate. And so, we always remain paranoid about weather. And just based on year-to-date, weather has not been all that kind. And so, we'll continue to execute on cost performance-related initiatives. We've had some good success over the last several years in executing on cost management over the course of the year, and we'll continue to do that through Q3. As I mentioned in the first quarter call, it's still premature to start thinking about pull aheads for 2025. I'd say historically, even in the best of years, where weather was really helpful in the first couple of quarters, we still didn't think about flexing up or pull ahead or any of those types of derisking mechanisms until we got deeper into Q3 and had a real good outlook on the fourth quarter. So hopefully, more to talk about from a 2025 derisking perspective next quarter. But at this point, it's too premature to get into that. Sure, Andrew. This is Rejji. I'll take, and I appreciate the question as always. Yes, we did see a little bit of a pullback in Q2 versus Q2 of last year for weather normalized sales for electric. I will always caveat and I think you alluded to it that it's a very imperfect science, and the team does a really good job trying to pull these numbers together with real accuracy. But again, it's very difficult to get real precision here. Just so everybody is grounded residential for the quarter versus Q2 of 2023, which is slightly up about 0.1%. And commercial down about 1 point, industrial down about 2 points, excluding on low-margin customer and an all-in blended was down about 1 point and so that is to your comment, unfavorable from the trends we were seeing in the first quarter. But I would say, on a year-to-date basis, the trend remains quite good, and we continue to be surprised for the upside really across all customer classes because our assumptions were incredibly conservative as they always are for the year. And so, we are outperforming across every customer class, what our initial expectations were that were embedded in our original guidance. And so, we are still seeing non-weather sales upside. I'll also note, as I've said before, that we had energy waste reduction incorporated into all of those numbers that you're seeing. And so, you should always add 2% to each of those customer classes because we're delivering the 2% reduction across every customer class year-over-year, and we've been doing that now really since the '08 law or thereabouts. And so, another way to think about those numbers I just quoted that you should add or gross up 2% across each of those, if you want to get the underlying economic conditions. So, we still remain quite good. And then we still remain quite pleased rather with the results. And then when you think about it on a year-to-date basis, where is up about 1 point. Commercial is up over 1%, industrial down about 1 point and all in is up about a little over 0.5%. So again, all things considered, particularly when you gross up for energy waste reduction, we think conditions in Michigan remain quite good really across all customer classes. Was that helpful? Andrew, all I would add to Garrick's good comments on the operational side is really applying a financial lens. And I would give us about a B+ on the financial side because through utilization of the CE Way, we've done a really good job reducing unit cost in our actual service restoration. And we're seeing at this point over $40 million of avoided costs. Now needless to say, I talked about negative variance attributable to overall service restoration costs versus last year.

And so, in addition to all the operational feat that Garrick highlighted, will also apply a really thoughtful financial lens as well as to make sure that we're bringing customers back online as quickly as possible and as quickly as possible and as cost efficiently as possible. So, I'd be remiss if I didn't add that as well. Julian, it's Rejji. I appreciate the question and welcome back. Really good to hear your voice. Let me start with a few of the just premises or working assumptions you offered up in the question. And so, let me start with the debt at the utility, just for factual purposes.

But I will say DIG did surprised a little bit to the upside in the first quarter because operationally, not only are they executing very well, but they're also executing on a lower unit cost basis, which drives a little bit of additional margin there also opportunities for off-peak margin that the team has capitalized on.

So that's really the thrust of it at NorthStar. Yes, I appreciate the question, Nick. I would say in short, I wouldn't say everything is on the table. So, you won't see us issuing equity in 2024.

            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our proven investment thesis, which delivers 6% to 8% adjusted earnings growth and affordable bills for our customers has been durable for more than two decades because we focus on what matters. Today, I'm going to highlight two key areas of our thesis. First, Michigan's strong regulatory environment. Built on a solid constructive framework, much of which is codified in Michigan law, 10-month forward-looking rate cases, important financial and fuel recovery mechanisms increased energy waste reduction incentives just to name a few attributes. This robust framework supports Michigan's position as a top-tier regulatory environment and provides supportive incentives for needed investments to make our electric and gas systems safer, more reliable and resilient and cleaner. And second, our continued commitment to affordable bills for our customers. As I've said before, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments and we keep customer build affordable. I consider our use of the CE Way, our lean operating system, one of the best in the industry. This approach limits upward pressure on customer bills. It is critical in the delivery of our investment plan. And we continue to see a long runway of cost-saving opportunities well into the future, delivering industry-leading results for all our stakeholders. From a regulatory perspective, we're off to a strong start for the year. As you can see on Slide 4, our regulatory calendar is mostly complete. We received a constructive order in our electric rate case in March, filed our new electric rate case in May and settled our gas rate case earlier this month, the fourth consecutive settlement in our gas business, four consecutive settlements in gas, yet another proof point highlighting the strong regulatory environment in Michigan. We're very pleased with our recently approved gas settlement, which calls for a $62.5 million of effective rate relief, a 9.9% ROE and a 50% equity ratio. We plan to follow our next gas rate case in December of this year. Outside of rate cases, our upcoming 20-year renewable energy plan or our EP filing in November is the only major remaining filing for the year. Let me pause there for a moment. Midway through the year. our financial-related regulatory outcomes are known. This is a great place to be. I also want to talk about our formula to deliver customer affordability as we make important investments. Long-term filings, like our renewable energy plan detail the significant planned investments that support safe, reliable, clean and affordable energy for our customers. As we shared previously, we see more investment opportunities as we make the transition to renewables and clean energy. In addition to the $17 billion of needed customer investments in our 5-year capital plan, our electric reliability road map and natural gas delivery plans highlight important investments well beyond within our financial plan. Now that's a long way of saying we see a long runway of necessary and important customer investments. These investments must be balanced with a laser focus on customer affordability. We take seriously our ability to create capital headroom to make those investments through continued use of the CE Way, which provides over $50 million of annual customer savings. Renegotiating over market PPAs in retiring our coal facilities, which together provide well over $200 million in savings as we transition toward cleaner resources. Capitalizing on economic development opportunities, particularly in manufacturing, which brings jobs and significant mission investments, spreading fixed costs over a larger customer base, benefiting all customers. Lastly, leveraging our best-in-class energy waste reduction programs to help customers reduce bills. This is a formula that works for everyone, continuing to strengthen the system with important investments while keeping customer bills affordable. Now let's look at the results and outlook. For the first half, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.63, up $0.18 versus the first half of 2023, largely driven by the constructive outcomes in our electric and gas rate cases. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives. Our full year guidance remained at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide toward the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance. I have confidence in our strong outlook this year and beyond as we continue to execute on our simple investment thesis, and make the necessary and important investments in our system while maintaining customer affordability. With that, Harry, please open the lines for Q&A. I would suggest, Jeremy, it's consistent with what we shared in the past, energy and capacity markets that upward pressure continues to be a ripe opportunity and we continue to strike nice bilateral contracts to secure managing capacity prices well above our plan. And so again, it's a good opportunity to continue to do that. And as we've shared in the past, this just continues to strengthen and lengthen our financial performance. And if I could just add to that, Jeremy, part of the call here in my prepared remarks, I talked about the confidence. Confidence comes from the fact that we're executing on the CE Way. We've done that historically. We typically have been at a run rate of greater than $50 million on an annual basis. We see that continuing. There are a number of things that we did in 2023 in terms of -- already Ready shared in his prepared remarks, voluntary separation, contract control as those continue to yield benefit in the year. And also, we're flying a lot of digital solutions, everything from work in the field to automate work, all the way into the office, things like work management that continue to provide additional cost savings in the year. So again, confident as I shared in the call here earlier, and delivering guidance for the year. Jeremy, you know us well enough the Hayes-Rochow team here. We're pretty conservative in our approach to financials. And as I shared in the Q1 call, we want to make sure it's signed on the dotted line, you might say, before we talk about it. So, we don't inflate our sales forecast. I would just say that there's a lot of interest in both manufacturing and data centers in the state as I shared in the Q1 call, seeing a lot of manufacturing growth. That continues into Q2. We saw data centers, we talked about one that we signed in Q1, 230 megawatts. There continues to be strong interest in the state, both the hyperscalers and also, we're seeing some growth in what I call, midscalers from a data center perspective, those continue to move forward regardless of legislation in the state. And so, the sales and use tax piece will continue in the conversation in the legislature. But again, it's a bit of Jerry on top of Sunday, you might say. Sure. I was really hoping for a rate design question. Let's talk about this. We definitely see as a part of this energy law, additional upside. That shows up in ownership of asset that shows up in the financial compensation mechanism, both those are true. Let me talk about how they'll play out, though. We're going to file this our renewable energy plan in November, it's a 10-month process. So, we'll know in 2025, kind of latter half of the year, what that looks like. And so, in our 2026 capital plan, you'll see what that means, our 2026 financials both from an FCM perspective as well as what might the ownership mix looks like. And so that's where it will play out. In addition to that, that's probably a portion of the story because in 2026, we'll also file our integrated resource plan, which we'll talk about some of the reliability pieces and some of the work to deliver the capacity component of that. So, between '26, '27, '28, I think that's when you'll see the capital impact as well as the financial compensation mechanism play out in terms of our financials. And I will say this, we've seen some good economic growth in the state. That will show up in our renewable energy plan. We're definitely seeing a greater need than was in our original 2021 IRP. So, I'll leave it at that. And certainly, that will provide additional upside opportunity in terms of capital growth in addition to the energy law. I set myself up for that one, didn't I? [indiscernible] here on this call. I will always look for settlement opportunities. I'm also very confident in our team. We put a great case together, and we can go to full distance, just as we did this year in our March order. And so, when I think about this electric rate case, there's some things that have to be figured out to really get some context around the opportunity for settlement. One, I think it's really important to understand that electric cases are more complex than gas cases. So, for example, we had less than 10 intervenors in our gas case. We have a little over 20 in our electric case. That's not abnormal, it's just, it's a more complex case. There's more interested party so we have to navigate through that. I also think it's important to find where staff is and where the Attorney General are at in this case. That will come in September. These are important points to know in the context of settlement opportunity. But I understand that, I am very confident in this case. It is focused on electric reliability. That's well aligned with what the customers are asking for, what the commissioners and the staff are asking for and what I've committed to do and so this case has great capital investments and undergrounding has important work hardening the system and automated transfer reclosures technology on the system. There's important work in O&M and tree trimming, our number one cause of outage and other important maintenance work across the system. We're going to leverage the infrastructure recovery mechanism, we'll certainly look for -- we're going to try another store mechanism in this case as well. And so, we feel confident in our ability to get the very constructive outcome, just given how well aligned we are across commission staff as well as our customers. So hopefully, that gives you some context on the case. Now on rate design, let me just talk a little bit about rate design. Specifically, data centers are not at our economic development rate. We had ex-parte filing that made an adjustment in that, that was approved. And so, in the meantime, they are an industrial rate. We thought our GDP rate and what that does is a better balance, both capacity and energy cost, the cost to serve those customers. The commission as well as the utility has been looking and exploring at the opportunity specific data center rate. But in the interest of time, the GDP is a good proxy for that in our mind. And so well suited from a rate design perspective, from a data center perspective. I also said GDP, I think that's the wrong thing. I was hoping for something different there. Maybe that was -- but GPD is what I meant -- sorry about that Shahriar I had my eyes on the economic [indiscernible] it's election time. I have my mind on other things like what's going to happen with our economy. It was not contingent. That one is still moving forward, that's the signed piece. And that's -- I guess that's my point. What we hear from data centers, it's more important about how fast can you get transmission here, how much cash can you build that conversion from transmission distribution to substation, how fast can you get supply here, and we're able to do that. And so many of those mid scalers and hyperscalers continue to make forward steps regardless of the progress on the sales new stack. And just to give you a little context, at the end of the spring session, the legislature was focused on the state budget. In the words of our governor, we've got to fix the damn road, and we got to fund schools, right? And so those are important things, too. I don't want -- we want smart kids in the state. So those are important things underway. That conversation on data centers and the sales tax will continue into the fall. Now we're in elections. So, it will be difficult for me to predict how fast that will move or it could happen to [indiscernible]. And so, we'll continue that conversation in the state. But again, it's not stopping things for moving forward, Michael. There's a number of variables there, Mike. So, in the case of that data center, what we talked about is they're bringing on load by 2025, 2026, and where they're located on the system makes a big difference. And so able to accommodate that. Depending on where the data center is located from a property perspective makes a difference. Just as far as how far do we have to extend lines, is it greenfield? there's all kinds of variables that go into it, but we're in that two to three years cycle. And again, even if you're at the tail end of that cycle, data centers are moving quickly, and that doesn't seem to be holding them up too much. The short answer is no. As you know, what makes Michigan great is much of the regulatory environment is set in law. So, 10-month forward-looking rate cases is in the law, financial compensation mechanism, energy efficiency incentives are in the law. And we just went through that law. We just opened and it was just signed here last November, and we're hearing nothing in terms of holding that law back up or looking at different traditions. Now we continue to always have a constructive dialogue with the commission and the staff. And so, I do think there are opportunities right, in terms. And so, I'll give you one example, just one example of probably many you could think about. We have a great process for an integrated resource plan and a renewable energy plan that lay out an energy supply portfolio. So, we get it preapproved and then it flows into rate cases. It really streamlines rate cases. What if we could do the same thing on the distribution system, wouldn't that be great? Let's build a 5-year reliability road map. Wait, we've already done that. Let's do that. Let's approve that and then have that flow into rate cases. That could really streamline the process. And it's done in the right way, you can potentially see a path where you could stay out for a period of time, again, done in the right way. And so, the kind of the nature of Michigan's constructive regulatory environment, let's explore that. Let's see if there's opportunities there to -- even for the bolstered Michigan constructive nature. So, we're seeing a number of great improvements as a result of the investments we have made to date. More needs to be done along those lines. And so, in fairness, I'd give ourselves a B in the context, there's more needs to be done for our customers. And that's evident in the rate case filing that we're doing. Where we've worked a lot, this year is reducing the size of the outage. And so, we've put in a lot of fusing. So, what I mean by that is you have less customers impacted when the tree comes down the line, that's an important work. We've more than doubled our free trimming work over the last three years. That's also provided a benefit when we trim treating there, we see a greater than 60% reduction in the number of outages. You may ask why not 100% because we still see trees outside the right way that impacts our performance. But I would also put it into context, Rejji talked about the last week of June, and there was a larger event in June, but there was a lot more smaller events which we would anticipate. We're trying to shrink the size, which makes restoration easier, but a lot of pockets throughout the state. We brought in a number of resources. We leverage a lot of our existing union resources to be able to respond to that, and we have good response from that perspective. We measure in terms of restoring our customers within a 24-hour window. We want to have all customers restored within a 24-hour window. And last year, in 2023, we're at 90% within a 24-hour window. This year, we're upwards of 95%. And so that shows the directional improvement. Now the year is not done. We've got a lot of work to do. and we'll continue to make some important investments throughout this year. And again, this electric rate case shows the path for more. So hopefully it gives us some context. I know Rejji wants to add to it as well. And here's Rochow. I don't know. I don't know if it has a ring to it. Look I'll give it a try. Sure. That's been a very constructive dialogue. As I've shared in the past, it started really wide in the number of metrics. And then through good dialogue, it was narrowed down to a nice four benchmarkable metrics. It's grown a little bit to accommodate some storm provisions. However, there's still a constructive dialogue underway here in July and August, there's filings to be able to navigate that. There's a few things we still want to work through and get -- Dot the Is and Check the Ts on you might say. And then I expect that this is going to play out over several rate cases. And so, it's not going to be implemented here immediately. I think it just speaks to the constructive dialogue we have in Michigan here. A lot of good interveners and filings that go back and forth to really make sure it's going to be a productive ratemaking mechanism. I would put it several rate cases away, so over maybe a year or two years out from an implementation perspective. Again, that's my view, just what I see of the world. The intent is for it to be symmetric. And so, there's upside opportunity and downside opportunity. The downside opportunity is market about $10 million at this context, which is manageable in the context of the year. That means the upside opportunity is roughly that same amount. And at least that is proposed currently. Yes. It's definitely trending higher based on all the economic development activity that is, again, not speculating on that, that is signed or -- and we're out building substations and there's transmission being built to serve these customers. And so, in our renewable energy plan filing, you should anticipate that there's additional sales reference there above and beyond our 2021 IRP. Yes, generally speaking. Palisade is making forward progress in the state. From a state budget perspective, another $150 million was allocated toward the forward direction of the facility. We're having public meetings that are going on right now on site. So again, forward steps and moving forward that plant. Now I remind you that a PPA has already been struck for the offtake from the Palisades facility that goes to a co-op in Michigan and a co-op in Indiana. So, it's already spoken for. Now we did -- it's good for Michigan that Palisade is returning. And we, at CMS Energy, do not see any adverse impact as a result of Palisade coming back. Thanks, Harry. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care, and stay safe."

The earnings news release issued earlier today and the presentation used in this webcast are available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section. This call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  \n Just a reminder, there will be a rebroadcast of this conference call today beginning at 12:00 p.m. Eastern Time, running through May 2. This presentation is also being webcast and is available on CMS Energy's website in the Investor Relations section.  \n At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jason Shore, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. \nJason Shore: Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me are Garrick Rochow, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rejji Hayes, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. This presentation contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to our SEC filings for more information regarding the risks and other factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially.  \n This presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the appendix and posted on our website. And now I'll turn the call over to Garrick. \nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Jason, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. CMS Energy, 21 years of consistent industry-leading results. And what sets us apart is our performance, and it starts with our investment thesis. It is how we prioritize and focus our work to deliver the service our customers deserve in the financial outcomes you expect.  \n As we look ahead, we see ample investment opportunity over the long term as we lead the clean energy transformation and deliver the critical work needed to improve the reliability and resiliency of our electric and gas systems. \n This important work is supported by legislation and a constructive regulatory environment, which provides confidence in making required investments to strengthen our system and prepare for a clean energy future. \n We plan ahead through our electric reliability road map, natural gas delivery plan and our upcoming renewable energy plan, which all provide visibility and transparency, and the work will deliver to keep our systems safe, sound and clean.  \n At CMS Energy, we work both sides of the equation. We make important investments in our systems, and we work to keep bills affordable. Our CE Way lean operating system helps us improve our performance, increase productivity and take costs out of the business. And we are hard at work to grow Michigan through economic development, ensuring Michigan thrives well into the future. These efforts are important and help us keep customers' bills affordable.  \n At CMS Energy, we make our investment thesis work year after year, and it continues to set us apart in the industry, delivering results for all our stakeholders. Today, I'm going to share 3 focus areas that have me excited about our future and give us confidence in our outlook.  \n First, our electric distribution system. As our world becomes more dependent on electricity for business growth, technology advancements, devices and vehicles, our system needs to be stronger, smarter and more resilient for our customers. But our vast electric distribution system is aging. It needs to be modernized and strengthened for increasingly severe weather. Over the past 5 years, we have seen some of the highest wind speeds on record in more frequent storm activity.  \n We have responded to this need through our electric reliability road map. Currently, a 5-year $7 billion plan to improve performance and harden our system for the future. The plan utilizes best practices from across the industry, including designing the system with stronger pull, undergrounding, sectionalizing in further automation. And given the size of our distribution system, 90,000 miles of line, nearly 1,200 substations and a historically lower investment per mile compared to peers, we see a long runway of needed investment.  \n We've incorporated roughly half of the incremental $3 billion you see on Slide 4, into our current capital plan, and you'll start to see this investment show up in our next electric rate case, which we'll file in the second quarter. These important investments will mean fewer in shorter outages for our customers, and we are already seeing meaningful improvements in the investments made over the last few years.  \n The second focus area I want to share is our continued leadership of the transformation to clean energy in the industry. In the past, I have shared our approved plans to eliminate coal in 2025, reduce carbon, grow energy efficiency and build out renewables in pursuit of our net zero target and cleaner air for our customers and our planet.  \n In late 2023, much of our clean energy targets were bolstered by Michigan's new clean energy law. This law is unique in the industry and is good for all stakeholders. It provides us with the opportunity to further reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining resource adequacy, affordable customer builds and delivering for our investors.  \n On the right side of the slide, you'll see the opportunities ahead, as we prepare to meet Michigan's new clean energy law. It supports an accelerated plan with the decarbonization of our system. With an enhanced financial compensation mechanism, which provides a roughly 9% return on clean purchase power agreements.  \n In addition, there's an increased incentive on energy efficiency as we target 60% renewables by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. And it gives us important flexibility as we think through how to best meet our customers' needs with renewables across the broad MISO footprint. This mechanism, the flexibility in the law, helps us balance customer affordability as we work through this transition.  \n For our customers, all this means stronger, more resilient and cleaner energy. For our investors, an exciting and robust investment runway well into the future.  \n Now let's work the other side of this investment equation. The third focus area that I want to share today how we are helping Michigan grow and thrive, which is good for our company, and our customers. \n Growth across our service territory is good for Michigan, helps keep bills affordable for our customers and provides headroom to the investments, I just referenced. And I couldn't be more excited about the growth we need in our state.  \n Michigan has a strong fiber network, access to fresh water, temperate climate, energy-ready site, and attractive energy rate. In February, we secured a contract with a large data center in the heart of our service territory. The majority of the 230 megawatts of new load is expected to be online by 2026. This is nice load growth.  \n And I'm even more excited about the manufacturing load growth we are seeing in Michigan, which is a differentiator for us. Our statewide leadership project such as Gotion, Hemlock Semiconductor, Ford and many others, continues to drive new and expanding load in our service territory. These projects bring significant jobs, supply chain, commercial growth, housing starts and broad Michigan investment.  \n The ancillary benefit of manufacturing growth are good for all customers, can bolster our confidence in our plan for 2024 and beyond. Our customers thrive when Michigan thrives. And I'm proud of the diversity and quality of new load our leadership is working to bring to the state.  \n Now let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.97. Although we experienced a warmer-than-normal winter, the healthy set of countermeasures we deployed in 2023 and as well as our active use of the CE Way continued to benefit us in 2024. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives.  \n Our full year guidance remains at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide to the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. \nRejji Hayes: Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the quarter and our year-to-go expectation. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a first quarter and 9 months to go basis.  \n In summary, through the first quarter of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $288 million or $0.97 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023 largely due to higher weather-normalized sales and lower service restoration costs of utility, partially offset by mild weather.  \n To elaborate on the impact of weather, we experienced another warm winter in Michigan during the first quarter, which had the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. The warm winter weather resulted in $0.06 per share of negative variance, which appears modest on the surface given the historically low number of heating degree days. However, it's important to note that last year's winter was also quite warm. \n Rate relief net of investment-related expenses resulted in $0.05 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our most recent electric rate case and last year's gas rate case settlement coupled with residual benefits from our 2023 electric rate case settlement approved last January.  \n From a cost performance perspective, our financials in the first quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by lower operating and maintenance or O&M expenses primarily attributable to lower service restoration costs than we experienced last year. \n Also, as Garrick noted, we continue to see benefits from select cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023, which have offset modest inflationary trends we've experienced in various cost categories such as wages, as planned, and we anticipate this trend to continue over the remainder of the year.  \n And our [ catch-all ] category represented by the final bucket in the actual section of the chart, you'll notice a healthy pickup of $0.19 per share, largely driven by weather normalized sales, which contributed almost half of said positive variance, particularly in our residential and commercial customer classes. It's worth noting that the leap year impacts comparability with 2023 for weather-normalized sales, but even absent the effects of the leap year, our residential weather-normalized sales up about 0.5%, and our commercial customer class was up almost 2.5% versus the prior year, which highlights the continued solid performance of our higher-margin customer classes.  \n Looking ahead, we plan for normal weather, as always, which equates to $0.22 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced for virtually all of 2023. \n From a regulatory perspective, we're assuming $0.18 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the constructive electric rate order received from the commission in early March. We are also assuming a supportive outcome in our pending gas rate case. \n On the cost side, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, and last year's voluntary separation program, among other 2023 cost reduction initiatives that continue to bear fruit.  \n We also assumed lower service restoration costs given last year's record level of storm activity in our service territory. In aggregate, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year.  \n Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.52 to $0.58 per share of negative variance.  \n Slide 8 offers the latest updates on our regulatory forward calendar. As you'll note in the top section, we plan to file a Renewable Energy Plan or REP by mid-November, which will highlight our strategy for complying with the various renewable energy targets associated with Michigan's new clean energy law. We are excited by the prospects of the new law, which will support our net zero carbon by 2040 goal and look forward to socializing our filing with key stakeholders in the coming months.  \n Once filed, the commission will have 300 days to issue an order, which will likely be in the third quarter of 2025. Therefore, as mentioned during our fourth quarter call, you should expect to the 5-year plan that will roll out in the first quarter of 2026 will incorporate a greater portion of the financial impacts of the REP.  \n Moving on to our general rate case filings. You can expect our next electric rate case to be filed in late May to early June time frame. This filing will incorporate some of the initial spend we have outlined in our 5-year electric reliability road map that Garrick touched on earlier. Given the 10-month stipulated period for rate cases in Michigan, we would expect to receive an order from the commission in the first quarter of 2025 and thus, the related financial impact.  \n Lastly, we anticipate an order in our pending gas rate case by mid-October, absent a settlement. While we don't always include a balance sheet update on our formal presentation, it is worth noting that Moody's and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings in March and April, respectively, as noted at the bottom of the table on Slide 9.  \n Longer term, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. \nGarrick Rochow: Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and provides us with confidence for a strong outlook this year and beyond. 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance, 21 proof point, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. With that, Drew, please open the lines for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners. \nShahriar Pourreza: I guess, firstly, just given you have an upcoming electric case. How are you thinking about any kind of incremental construct improvements there? Would you kind of seek an expanded IRM framework? And do you need to address any kind of the rate design issues with C&I rates, especially as you're trying to accommodate new load like data center growth, especially just trying to kind of balance that customer rate impact. \nGarrick Rochow: Shahriar, you want me to get into rate design. You guys are all going to fall asleep on this call if I go into rate design. Let me start out with the fundamentals of this electric case. I think this is really important. You've heard me time and time again, whether it's investor meetings or in our calls and the importance of improving reliability. We've seen higher wind speeds, more frequent storm activity. And just this is our focus as a company, how we improve reliability and the longer-term resiliency of our electric system.  \n You can also hear that from the commissioners. They're very clear about that expectation. And so I would say there's really good alignment there. And this reliability road map does just that. It's aimed at those important capital improvements. There's some O&M work associated with that as well. These are best practices in the industry, which we're deploying across our system and going to a meaningful benefit for our customers.  \n In addition to that, we're focused on the affordability piece. This is how the fundamentals of this, great to invest the capital, but you also have to be focused on the affordability piece for our customers. And so it's driving down unit cost through the CE Way, it's other cost offsets, there's a whole range of things we're doing to make sure this next electric rate case delivers for our customers in terms of improved reliability and offsetting from a cost perspective. So that's the fundamentals of the case.  \n And so we're going to look at different mechanisms in that case. As I've shared before, I would anticipate that we, again, take advantage of our infrastructure recovery mechanism that was supported in the last case. We'll look at a storm recovery mechanism. We've utilized that in previous cases. We'll continue to look at that optionality and what that could look like in this case. \n Again, longer term, we'll file this in the May, first part of June. I feel confident about what we're putting together based on the important merits of the case that are going to improve reliability, will balance the important components of affordability.  \n Now your question on rate design, there's a lot in rate design. I really will put you to sleep if I go there. We're going to make sure as the state expands, and we have this important load growth that both energy and capacity component, that cost of service mechanism is appropriately allocated to where those costs are. That's what we've done historically. That's what the commission supported. And so we'll look at that certainly within the context of this case, but it's really smaller in the grand scheme of the important work of this case. \nShahriar Pourreza: Got it. Perfect. And then lastly, as we're thinking about the energy law construct [indiscernible], I guess, what are some of the first changes you can implement, especially as we're thinking about the upcoming IRP update. Would you lean more on sort of that FCM construct? And is any of this kind of embedded in your long-range growth guidance? \nGarrick Rochow: It's still early days on some of those modeling. So we'll file our REP, Renewable Energy Plan, on November 15. And as I've shared historically here or previous here, there's a broad spectrum of ownership versus PPAs. PPAs obviously have the opportunity for the financial compensation mechanism or if you're going to build everything and own everything, obviously, you have the opportunity to earn your ROE.  \n So there's a broad spectrum. You do all either end, those are the bookends. I think it's somewhere in the mix, and there's a lot of variables we need to consider that we're modeling out right now, and that's why we're not prepared to share what that looks like. But let me hand it over to Rejji, I know he has some additional thoughts on this. \nRejji Hayes: Thanks for the question. All I would add to Garrick's comments is that in our current 5-year plan, what we've incorporated is just a modest amount of PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism, and that's solely because of the fact that any PPA put in place after June of this year would be subject to the new FCM, which is around 9% versus the prior of about 5.5%. And so we have a portion of that, albeit a small portion incorporated in this 5-year plan.  \n We've also incorporated the enhanced economic incentives associated with energy efficiency. And so that's flowing through our plan as well. And remember, historically, we've, on the electric side, been reducing load about 2% year-over-year. And before the new energy law, we get a 20% incentive on top of that spend, that's now 22.5%, so that's also a source of financial upside embedded into this plan. \n But to Garrick's earlier comments, the much more expansive opportunities, whether it's scaling contracts or the ownership opportunities or more specifically the rate base opportunities. Those are not incorporated into our 5-year plan and really won't be until 2026. \nShahriar Pourreza: Okay. Perfect. Appreciate it, Garrick, for the record, your rate design answer was not boring at all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Campanella from Barclays. \nNicholas Campanella: I guess just thinking about the other off-site opportunities, can you maybe give us an update on your conversations around DIG and the recontracting opportunity there? And how those discussions have been progressing? Is this something that we can maybe see an update on by year-end? Or is it more a '25, '26 item? Maybe just talk about timing there. \nRejji Hayes: Nick, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. Yes, as we talked about on our fourth quarter call, we still have about 30% to 35% open margin in the outer years of our plan, really starting in sort of 2026 or second half of 2016 going through 2028. We certainly are seeing attractive reverse inquiry for that open margin on the capacity side. We're sold through on the energy side through 2028 or through the duration of this 5-year plan, but there still are opportunities in the capacity side. And we'll be thoughtful. \n We never are too aggressive in selling down that open margin. We like to have a little bit of optionality, particularly with a really attractive technical that we continue to see in Zone 7 with the tightening of supply and upward pressure on demand. And so we'll provide an update in our next 5-year plan, as we always do. And I expect that we'll be selling down a portion of the open margin ratably over the coming months and quarters, but should still have probably a little open margin as we provide a new 5-year plan in the first quarter next year. Is that helpful? \nNicholas Campanella: That is helpful. I appreciate that. And I guess thinking about the rate case cadence and outcomes. On the electric side, the last case to kind of pursue the fully litigated outcome, but on the gas side, you just received staff testimony. And I think, Rejji, I heard you say you get an order in fourth quarter absent a settlement. So just what's your reaction to staff starting point here? And what are your thoughts on being able to settle the gas case? \nGarrick Rochow: I'd go back Nick to the fundamentals of that case, aiming for a safe natural gas system, you continue to reduce methane across that and deliver affordable natural gas to our customers. And so again, the imbalance -- that equation of making the investments in the natural gas system, also just like we're doing in the electric business, aiming for an improved affordability across the gas system through unit costs, through cost out using the CE Way and the likes. \n So those fundamentals are true. Staff position, I would categorize as constructive, a constructive starting point. And so we'll look, once we have that position, we're going to look for the opportunity for settlement. We've been able to work with a number of the interveners in the past and have a good track record there. But I also hear this, I'm confident in the testimony and the merits of the case. So if we need to go to full distance, we will, and get a constructive outcome both for our customers and stakeholders. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. \nJeremy Tonet: Just want to dive in, I guess, to the sales outlook, came in a bit better than expected, I guess, for the first quarter and for the balance of the year, it looks like that's trending better than expected. And just wondering by customer class, if you could dive in a bit more on the drivers that you're seeing that within each class that is leading to this uptick? \nRejji Hayes: Ye's. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. So yes, we were pleased with the first quarter performance of non-weather sales. We provide good color on that in our earnings digest, which you probably saw. But going through the customer classes, we saw residential up just under 1.5% versus Q1 of 2023. And so on the surface that looks quite good, but it's important to note that the leap day in the quarter because it's a leap year, drove about 2/3 of that. But still even absent leap day, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, still up about 0.5%. \n I still think we continue to see continued upside of the return to work or return to facilities trend, where I think we had pretty conservative assumptions about returning to facilities, and we are seeing a stickiness to folks having our corporations retaining what I would describe as a hybrid workforce. And so that is still, I think, delivering some surprise to the upside, and it is a higher margin customer class, as you know. \n On the commercial side, really quite pleased with what we've seen. And so the number was just under 3.5% increase versus Q1 of 2023. And the leap year only affected about 1/3 of that. So pro forma for the leap year, we were still just under 2.5%. So very pleased with that. And our speculation, we've seen some of the subsectors within commercial that have performed pretty well. Agriculture, mining, up about 6.5%. We also saw entertainment up about 3%. And so we've seen some of the subsectors perform pretty well. \n But we also think because folks are actually going to the office, at least 3 days a week, that does create foot traffic in communities and folks are going to cafes and things of that nature. So that's also part of it as well, but that's a bit more speculate there, but that's our sense. \n And then within Industrial, if you exclude one low-margin large customer, we're just over -- sorry, just slightly up, let's say, about 20, 25 basis points, and the leap year did have a big impact on that class. And so pro forma for the leap year, you're down about 1%. I will always caveat 2 things whenever we talk about weather-normalized sales. One, remember, those numbers include the fact that we're reducing our load by 2% each year in electric due to energy efficiency. So all these numbers should be on a gross basis, up 2%. And so you should provide that color to these industrial numbers. \n The other thing I always caveat is that weather normalization math as good as our team is, as hard as they work to get it right, is a very imperfect science. And so it is very difficult to get these numbers exactly right. \n But what I would say in terms of industrial that we feel very good, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks about the economic outlook and just have a robust pipeline and a very diversified pipeline of industrial opportunities, which really aren't reflected in our numbers at this point. It won't be until the outer years of our plan, and we'll be disappointed if that opportunity doesn't continue to bear fruit for the next couple of years. \n Now that's the color I can offer across each customer class, but certainly happy to take any follow-ups as needed. \nJeremy Tonet: That's very helpful. And maybe just pivoting a bit here, it seems on the side that they lay out there's a bit of cushion to hitting the guide in '24. And so just wondering, I guess, how you feel confidence level guide at this point, does it put you in a position to start thinking about '25? Just wanted to get a sense for how that stands. \nRejji Hayes: Yes. I would say, Jeremy, early days. Obviously, we're delighted that 2024 is not 2023 in that we don't have a big storm as well as mild weather to start off the year, which we obviously saw last year. But to be clear, we still saw negative variance in terms of weather, top line-related weather. And so there's still some work to do. And so we are countermeasuring and again, very confident in the outlook. But it's a little early before we start thinking about derisking 2025 and beyond. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Arcaro from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Arcaro: I was wondering what you're seeing in terms of maybe data center demand in the pipeline. Any uptick in further requests to connect beyond the big kind of megawatt addition that you called out? And wondering if that customer class, I guess, would potentially be involved in the voluntary renewables plan? Any upside potential there? \nGarrick Rochow: Thanks for your question, David. A couple of things on this. I typically don't like to talk about the pipeline just because it's pretty speculative on that. And many of these data center companies are testing the waters in a variety of different utilities. And so we typically talk in terms of contracts. And when we talk about economic development, whether it's manufacturing or data centers, it's secured contracts, which we, again, feel really good about. Let me reflect a little bit on this project, and then I'll talk -- I will highlight the pipeline. I will get to your answer. \n This particular project, this data center expansion that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is 230 megawatts, online by 2025, a majority of the load in place by 2026. And so that does speak to our ability and capabilities to be able to deliver for these customers. \n And then you see Michigan, and I said this in some of my remarks, temperate climate, which is great for the heating and cooling load of a data center, a lot of freshwater and then energy-ready sites, attractive energy rates, good fiber network, all that comes together to make Michigan really attractive. \n I will say within the state of Michigan, there is a sales and use tax that exists where there's roughly a dozen states that have the sales and use tax in place, about 6%. There is an exemption process as being a build that are being considered in the House and Senate. It's passed the House in a bipartisan way. It's moved over to the Senate for consideration. We think that's going to move forward, that exemption, probably in the June, July time frame at the end of the session before they go on summer break. And that will open up Michigan a bit more for that pipeline. \n There are companies that are exploring Michigan right now, large data center providers, names that you would recognize. But again, it's a little bit -- they're testing the water in a lot of different locations. And so we'll see how Michigan progresses. We're certainly an attractive place to do business, and we'll look to track that low growth appropriately. \n And but as I stated in my previous remarks, we want to make sure there's a good balance that they're picking up the costs associated with that load as well, both from an energy and capacity perspective. So that's all the things that work in the balance, David. Hopefully, that provides some light to your question. Let me know if I didn't strike the right balance there. \nDavid Arcaro: It does. That's helpful. Yes. And are you thinking there could be upside to your long-term load growth expectations? Or is it still early? \nGarrick Rochow: We've got a -- we have -- between the manufacturing load this contract and the data center load that's contracted. As Rejji said, it's a nice piece of load growth that we factored in the later years of this 5-year plan, but future 5-year plans. And we're excited about what that means. And there's a strong pipeline, both from a manufacturing perspective and to a degree, the data center perspective as well. I'd be disappointed if some of those projects in the pipeline didn't materialize. \nDavid Arcaro: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And a separate topic. I was wondering you're just latest expectations for the performance-based rates process in terms of timing and where that outcome might be headed. \nGarrick Rochow: That's progressed in a constructive way. We had close to 10 or a dozen metrics that were originally proposed. It's narrowed to 4 metrics that are benchmarkable and there's good standards. And so again, a constructive process plays out. There's more work to do from our perspective when we filed comments in the February, March time frame. \n We're expecting a report from the Michigan Public Service Commission staff in May, and so we'll see the next round of thinking. I would suggest that a couple of electric rate cases away, not this case, perhaps the next case before we see implementation. But again, this is an evolving process with the Public Service Commission. \nOperator: Our next question today comes from Michael Sullivan from Wolfe. \nMichael Sullivan: Just sticking with the data center conversation, it sounds like you're kind of optimistic on this legislation and if that does pass and start to bring more interest to the state, what do you think about the potential for DIG being used in its entirety as like a behind-the-meter solution for like a larger type data center build-out? I know there's been a lot of focus on that on the nuclear side of things elsewhere, but people talking about gas as well. So just curious of your thoughts there. \nGarrick Rochow: Similar to Rejji's comments, from an energy perspective, energy tools and a capacity of the bilateral contracts, much of DIG has been spoken for at attractive -- really attractive position that either meets our expectations or is above our expectations. And so there's really unless you're beyond 2028, and maybe in the 2030s decade, DIG's really not available because it's already been secured and with, again, attractive energy tools and bilateral contracts for capacity. \nMichael Sullivan: Okay. Fair enough. Makes sense. And then just on your upcoming [ audit rate ] case filing here just to set expectations. I know 1 of your peers in the state recently filed and got a pretty quick response from the AG. Are you anticipating something similar with yours? Should we just be prepped for that? \nGarrick Rochow: It is -- we got primaries in August, and that means early [indiscernible] balance start in June. And so its political season already in Michigan. And so I would anticipate that. Look, the Attorney General participates in all our cases, that's been a historical practice. Sometimes those are more public than other times. We stand, as I shared earlier, by the merits of the case, both in our gas case that's underway right now and this electric rate case. \n The team just went through a walk through this week, and I couldn't be more proud of the work the team's put together on it. As I shared earlier in my questions or responses to questions, we're focused on reliability. That's going to improve for our customers. That is absolutely the right thing to do, well aligned with the Public Service Commission. \n We're working hard to create affordability, and we're good at that through the CE Way, the reducing power supply cost, their unit costs from execution of capital. And when you get that mix right, that equation, right, it makes it I mean you get good outcomes. And so I'm excited about this case. It's certainly going to be a step-up in capital. There's going to be some O&M work too, that's focused on reliability, but there's also some offsets that are really exciting that make us -- get me excited, as you can tell by the tone of my voice about what we're filing and what we put it together because it's going to be good for customers, and it's going to be good for all stakeholders. \nOperator: Our final question comes from Andrew Weisel from Scotiabank. \nAndrew Weisel: Follow up on the rate cases here. Just a couple of follow-ups on the rate cases. So first, I think you just alluded to this to the electric side. You're going to have more capital and more O&M. Just from a headline perspective, should we expect a larger revenue increase request than what we've seen in past [ dialings ] in terms of percent increase to customer bills. \nGarrick Rochow: Yes. The short answer is yes. But again, important work from a capital investment perspective and reliability, and we've done a lot to offset some of the O&M costs components of this to strike that right balance. And that's what I mean by the important fundamentals or merits of the case. \nAndrew Weisel: Okay. Very good. And then procedurally on the gas side. I know this case is unique in that there's no ALJ. Does that change the time line at all or the potential for settlement? You talked a bit about settlement, but the lack of ALJs that factor in at all? \nGarrick Rochow: No. The team seems excited about the opportunity to get to the table. Now that we have staff position now that we know where intervenors are at, to talk settlement. And as I shared, we've been able to navigate that with success in the past with all interveners, all stakeholders. And so we'll look to do that, but also hear my confidence in the merits of the case that if we need to go to full distance, we will. And I know that will get a good outcome for our customers and for stakeholders. \nOperator: That concludes the Q&A portion of today's call. I'll now hand back over to Garrick. \nGarrick Rochow: Thanks, Drew. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care and stay safe. \nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Rejji Hayes",
            "content": "Thank you, Garrick, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 7, you'll see our standard waterfall chart, which illustrates the key drivers impacting our financial performance for the quarter and our year-to-go expectation. For clarification purposes, all of the variance analysis herein are in comparison to 2023, both on a first quarter and 9 months to go basis.  \n In summary, through the first quarter of 2024, we delivered adjusted net income of $288 million or $0.97 per share, which compares favorably to the comparable period in 2023 largely due to higher weather-normalized sales and lower service restoration costs of utility, partially offset by mild weather.  \n To elaborate on the impact of weather, we experienced another warm winter in Michigan during the first quarter, which had the second lowest number of heating degree days in the past 25 years. The warm winter weather resulted in $0.06 per share of negative variance, which appears modest on the surface given the historically low number of heating degree days. However, it's important to note that last year's winter was also quite warm. \n Rate relief net of investment-related expenses resulted in $0.05 per share of positive variance due to constructive outcomes achieved in our most recent electric rate case and last year's gas rate case settlement coupled with residual benefits from our 2023 electric rate case settlement approved last January.  \n From a cost performance perspective, our financials in the first quarter of 2024 were positively impacted by lower operating and maintenance or O&M expenses primarily attributable to lower service restoration costs than we experienced last year. \n Also, as Garrick noted, we continue to see benefits from select cost reduction initiatives implemented in 2023, which have offset modest inflationary trends we've experienced in various cost categories such as wages, as planned, and we anticipate this trend to continue over the remainder of the year.  \n And our [ catch-all ] category represented by the final bucket in the actual section of the chart, you'll notice a healthy pickup of $0.19 per share, largely driven by weather normalized sales, which contributed almost half of said positive variance, particularly in our residential and commercial customer classes. It's worth noting that the leap year impacts comparability with 2023 for weather-normalized sales, but even absent the effects of the leap year, our residential weather-normalized sales up about 0.5%, and our commercial customer class was up almost 2.5% versus the prior year, which highlights the continued solid performance of our higher-margin customer classes.  \n Looking ahead, we plan for normal weather, as always, which equates to $0.22 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year, given the mild temperatures experienced for virtually all of 2023. \n From a regulatory perspective, we're assuming $0.18 per share of positive variance, which is largely driven by the constructive electric rate order received from the commission in early March. We are also assuming a supportive outcome in our pending gas rate case. \n On the cost side, we anticipate lower overall O&M expense at the utility driven by the usual cost performance fueled by the CE Way, and last year's voluntary separation program, among other 2023 cost reduction initiatives that continue to bear fruit.  \n We also assumed lower service restoration costs given last year's record level of storm activity in our service territory. In aggregate, we expect these items to drive $0.09 per share of positive variance for the remaining 9 months of the year.  \n Lastly, in the penultimate bar on the right-hand side, you'll note a significant negative variance which largely consists of the absence of select onetime countermeasures from last year and the usual conservative assumptions around weather-normalized sales and nonutility performance among other items. In aggregate, these assumptions equate to $0.52 to $0.58 per share of negative variance.  \n Slide 8 offers the latest updates on our regulatory forward calendar. As you'll note in the top section, we plan to file a Renewable Energy Plan or REP by mid-November, which will highlight our strategy for complying with the various renewable energy targets associated with Michigan's new clean energy law. We are excited by the prospects of the new law, which will support our net zero carbon by 2040 goal and look forward to socializing our filing with key stakeholders in the coming months.  \n Once filed, the commission will have 300 days to issue an order, which will likely be in the third quarter of 2025. Therefore, as mentioned during our fourth quarter call, you should expect to the 5-year plan that will roll out in the first quarter of 2026 will incorporate a greater portion of the financial impacts of the REP.  \n Moving on to our general rate case filings. You can expect our next electric rate case to be filed in late May to early June time frame. This filing will incorporate some of the initial spend we have outlined in our 5-year electric reliability road map that Garrick touched on earlier. Given the 10-month stipulated period for rate cases in Michigan, we would expect to receive an order from the commission in the first quarter of 2025 and thus, the related financial impact.  \n Lastly, we anticipate an order in our pending gas rate case by mid-October, absent a settlement. While we don't always include a balance sheet update on our formal presentation, it is worth noting that Moody's and Fitch reaffirmed our credit ratings in March and April, respectively, as noted at the bottom of the table on Slide 9.  \n Longer term, we continue to target solid investment-grade credit ratings, and we'll continue to manage our key credit metrics accordingly as we balance the needs of the business. And with that, I'll hand it back to Garrick for his final remarks before the Q&A session. Thanks for the question. All I would add to Garrick's comments is that in our current 5-year plan, what we've incorporated is just a modest amount of PPAs with the financial compensation mechanism, and that's solely because of the fact that any PPA put in place after June of this year would be subject to the new FCM, which is around 9% versus the prior of about 5.5%. And so we have a portion of that, albeit a small portion incorporated in this 5-year plan.  \n We've also incorporated the enhanced economic incentives associated with energy efficiency. And so that's flowing through our plan as well. And remember, historically, we've, on the electric side, been reducing load about 2% year-over-year. And before the new energy law, we get a 20% incentive on top of that spend, that's now 22.5%, so that's also a source of financial upside embedded into this plan. \n But to Garrick's earlier comments, the much more expansive opportunities, whether it's scaling contracts or the ownership opportunities or more specifically the rate base opportunities. Those are not incorporated into our 5-year plan and really won't be until 2026. Nick, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. Yes, as we talked about on our fourth quarter call, we still have about 30% to 35% open margin in the outer years of our plan, really starting in sort of 2026 or second half of 2016 going through 2028. We certainly are seeing attractive reverse inquiry for that open margin on the capacity side. We're sold through on the energy side through 2028 or through the duration of this 5-year plan, but there still are opportunities in the capacity side. And we'll be thoughtful. \n We never are too aggressive in selling down that open margin. We like to have a little bit of optionality, particularly with a really attractive technical that we continue to see in Zone 7 with the tightening of supply and upward pressure on demand. And so we'll provide an update in our next 5-year plan, as we always do. And I expect that we'll be selling down a portion of the open margin ratably over the coming months and quarters, but should still have probably a little open margin as we provide a new 5-year plan in the first quarter next year. Is that helpful? Ye's. Jeremy, this is Rejji. I appreciate the question. So yes, we were pleased with the first quarter performance of non-weather sales. We provide good color on that in our earnings digest, which you probably saw. But going through the customer classes, we saw residential up just under 1.5% versus Q1 of 2023. And so on the surface that looks quite good, but it's important to note that the leap day in the quarter because it's a leap year, drove about 2/3 of that. But still even absent leap day, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, still up about 0.5%. \n I still think we continue to see continued upside of the return to work or return to facilities trend, where I think we had pretty conservative assumptions about returning to facilities, and we are seeing a stickiness to folks having our corporations retaining what I would describe as a hybrid workforce. And so that is still, I think, delivering some surprise to the upside, and it is a higher margin customer class, as you know. \n On the commercial side, really quite pleased with what we've seen. And so the number was just under 3.5% increase versus Q1 of 2023. And the leap year only affected about 1/3 of that. So pro forma for the leap year, we were still just under 2.5%. So very pleased with that. And our speculation, we've seen some of the subsectors within commercial that have performed pretty well. Agriculture, mining, up about 6.5%. We also saw entertainment up about 3%. And so we've seen some of the subsectors perform pretty well. \n But we also think because folks are actually going to the office, at least 3 days a week, that does create foot traffic in communities and folks are going to cafes and things of that nature. So that's also part of it as well, but that's a bit more speculate there, but that's our sense. \n And then within Industrial, if you exclude one low-margin large customer, we're just over -- sorry, just slightly up, let's say, about 20, 25 basis points, and the leap year did have a big impact on that class. And so pro forma for the leap year, you're down about 1%. I will always caveat 2 things whenever we talk about weather-normalized sales. One, remember, those numbers include the fact that we're reducing our load by 2% each year in electric due to energy efficiency. So all these numbers should be on a gross basis, up 2%. And so you should provide that color to these industrial numbers. \n The other thing I always caveat is that weather normalization math as good as our team is, as hard as they work to get it right, is a very imperfect science. And so it is very difficult to get these numbers exactly right. \n But what I would say in terms of industrial that we feel very good, as Garrick noted in his prepared remarks about the economic outlook and just have a robust pipeline and a very diversified pipeline of industrial opportunities, which really aren't reflected in our numbers at this point. It won't be until the outer years of our plan, and we'll be disappointed if that opportunity doesn't continue to bear fruit for the next couple of years. \n Now that's the color I can offer across each customer class, but certainly happy to take any follow-ups as needed. Yes. I would say, Jeremy, early days. Obviously, we're delighted that 2024 is not 2023 in that we don't have a big storm as well as mild weather to start off the year, which we obviously saw last year. But to be clear, we still saw negative variance in terms of weather, top line-related weather. And so there's still some work to do. And so we are countermeasuring and again, very confident in the outlook. But it's a little early before we start thinking about derisking 2025 and beyond."

These efforts are important and help us keep customers' bills affordable.  \n At CMS Energy, we make our investment thesis work year after year, and it continues to set us apart in the industry, delivering results for all our stakeholders. Today, I'm going to share 3 focus areas that have me excited about our future and give us confidence in our outlook.  \n First, our electric distribution system. As our world becomes more dependent on electricity for business growth, technology advancements, devices and vehicles, our system needs to be stronger, smarter and more resilient for our customers. But our vast electric distribution system is aging. It needs to be modernized and strengthened for increasingly severe weather. Over the past 5 years, we have seen some of the highest wind speeds on record in more frequent storm activity.  \n We have responded to this need through our electric reliability road map. Currently, a 5-year $7 billion plan to improve performance and harden our system for the future. The plan utilizes best practices from across the industry, including designing the system with stronger pull, undergrounding, sectionalizing in further automation. And given the size of our distribution system, 90,000 miles of line, nearly 1,200 substations and a historically lower investment per mile compared to peers, we see a long runway of needed investment.  \n We've incorporated roughly half of the incremental $3 billion you see on Slide 4, into our current capital plan, and you'll start to see this investment show up in our next electric rate case, which we'll file in the second quarter. These important investments will mean fewer in shorter outages for our customers, and we are already seeing meaningful improvements in the investments made over the last few years.  \n The second focus area I want to share is our continued leadership of the transformation to clean energy in the industry. In the past, I have shared our approved plans to eliminate coal in 2025, reduce carbon, grow energy efficiency and build out renewables in pursuit of our net zero target and cleaner air for our customers and our planet.  \n In late 2023, much of our clean energy targets were bolstered by Michigan's new clean energy law. This law is unique in the industry and is good for all stakeholders. It provides us with the opportunity to further reduce our carbon footprint while maintaining resource adequacy, affordable customer builds and delivering for our investors.  \n On the right side of the slide, you'll see the opportunities ahead, as we prepare to meet Michigan's new clean energy law. It supports an accelerated plan with the decarbonization of our system. With an enhanced financial compensation mechanism, which provides a roughly 9% return on clean purchase power agreements.  \n In addition, there's an increased incentive on energy efficiency as we target 60% renewables by 2035 and 100% clean energy by 2040. And it gives us important flexibility as we think through how to best meet our customers' needs with renewables across the broad MISO footprint. This mechanism, the flexibility in the law, helps us balance customer affordability as we work through this transition.  \n For our customers, all this means stronger, more resilient and cleaner energy. For our investors, an exciting and robust investment runway well into the future.  \n Now let's work the other side of this investment equation. The third focus area that I want to share today how we are helping Michigan grow and thrive, which is good for our company, and our customers. \n Growth across our service territory is good for Michigan, helps keep bills affordable for our customers and provides headroom to the investments, I just referenced. And I couldn't be more excited about the growth we need in our state.  \n Michigan has a strong fiber network, access to fresh water, temperate climate, energy-ready site, and attractive energy rate. In February, we secured a contract with a large data center in the heart of our service territory. The majority of the 230 megawatts of new load is expected to be online by 2026. This is nice load growth.  \n And I'm even more excited about the manufacturing load growth we are seeing in Michigan, which is a differentiator for us. Our statewide leadership project such as Gotion, Hemlock Semiconductor, Ford and many others, continues to drive new and expanding load in our service territory. These projects bring significant jobs, supply chain, commercial growth, housing starts and broad Michigan investment.  \n The ancillary benefit of manufacturing growth are good for all customers, can bolster our confidence in our plan for 2024 and beyond. Our customers thrive when Michigan thrives. And I'm proud of the diversity and quality of new load our leadership is working to bring to the state.  \n Now let's get into the numbers. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.97. Although we experienced a warmer-than-normal winter, the healthy set of countermeasures we deployed in 2023 and as well as our active use of the CE Way continued to benefit us in 2024. We remain confident in this year's guidance and long-term outlook and are reaffirming all our financial objectives.  \n Our full year guidance remains at $3.29 to $3.35 per share with continued confidence toward the high end. Longer term, we continue to guide to the high end of our adjusted EPS growth range of 6% to 8%, which implies and includes 7% up to 8%. With that, I'll hand the call over to Rejji. Thank you, Rejji. Our simple investment thesis is how we run our business and provides us with confidence for a strong outlook this year and beyond. 21 years of consistent industry-leading financial performance, 21 proof point, regardless of conditions, no excuses, just results. With that, Drew, please open the lines for Q&A. Shahriar, you want me to get into rate design. You guys are all going to fall asleep on this call if I go into rate design. Let me start out with the fundamentals of this electric case. I think this is really important. You've heard me time and time again, whether it's investor meetings or in our calls and the importance of improving reliability. We've seen higher wind speeds, more frequent storm activity. And just this is our focus as a company, how we improve reliability and the longer-term resiliency of our electric system.  \n You can also hear that from the commissioners. They're very clear about that expectation. And so I would say there's really good alignment there. And this reliability road map does just that. It's aimed at those important capital improvements. There's some O&M work associated with that as well. These are best practices in the industry, which we're deploying across our system and going to a meaningful benefit for our customers.  \n In addition to that, we're focused on the affordability piece. This is how the fundamentals of this, great to invest the capital, but you also have to be focused on the affordability piece for our customers. And so it's driving down unit cost through the CE Way, it's other cost offsets, there's a whole range of things we're doing to make sure this next electric rate case delivers for our customers in terms of improved reliability and offsetting from a cost perspective. So that's the fundamentals of the case.  \n And so we're going to look at different mechanisms in that case. As I've shared before, I would anticipate that we, again, take advantage of our infrastructure recovery mechanism that was supported in the last case. We'll look at a storm recovery mechanism. We've utilized that in previous cases. We'll continue to look at that optionality and what that could look like in this case. \n Again, longer term, we'll file this in the May, first part of June. I feel confident about what we're putting together based on the important merits of the case that are going to improve reliability, will balance the important components of affordability.  \n Now your question on rate design, there's a lot in rate design. I really will put you to sleep if I go there. We're going to make sure as the state expands, and we have this important load growth that both energy and capacity component, that cost of service mechanism is appropriately allocated to where those costs are. That's what we've done historically. That's what the commission supported. And so we'll look at that certainly within the context of this case, but it's really smaller in the grand scheme of the important work of this case. It's still early days on some of those modeling. So we'll file our REP, Renewable Energy Plan, on November 15. And as I've shared historically here or previous here, there's a broad spectrum of ownership versus PPAs. PPAs obviously have the opportunity for the financial compensation mechanism or if you're going to build everything and own everything, obviously, you have the opportunity to earn your ROE.  \n So there's a broad spectrum. You do all either end, those are the bookends. I think it's somewhere in the mix, and there's a lot of variables we need to consider that we're modeling out right now, and that's why we're not prepared to share what that looks like. But let me hand it over to Rejji, I know he has some additional thoughts on this. I'd go back Nick to the fundamentals of that case, aiming for a safe natural gas system, you continue to reduce methane across that and deliver affordable natural gas to our customers. And so again, the imbalance -- that equation of making the investments in the natural gas system, also just like we're doing in the electric business, aiming for an improved affordability across the gas system through unit costs, through cost out using the CE Way and the likes. \n So those fundamentals are true. Staff position, I would categorize as constructive, a constructive starting point. And so we'll look, once we have that position, we're going to look for the opportunity for settlement. We've been able to work with a number of the interveners in the past and have a good track record there. But I also hear this, I'm confident in the testimony and the merits of the case. So if we need to go to full distance, we will, and get a constructive outcome both for our customers and stakeholders. Thanks for your question, David. A couple of things on this. I typically don't like to talk about the pipeline just because it's pretty speculative on that. And many of these data center companies are testing the waters in a variety of different utilities. And so we typically talk in terms of contracts. And when we talk about economic development, whether it's manufacturing or data centers, it's secured contracts, which we, again, feel really good about. Let me reflect a little bit on this project, and then I'll talk -- I will highlight the pipeline. I will get to your answer. \n This particular project, this data center expansion that we mentioned in the prepared remarks, is 230 megawatts, online by 2025, a majority of the load in place by 2026. And so that does speak to our ability and capabilities to be able to deliver for these customers. \n And then you see Michigan, and I said this in some of my remarks, temperate climate, which is great for the heating and cooling load of a data center, a lot of freshwater and then energy-ready sites, attractive energy rates, good fiber network, all that comes together to make Michigan really attractive. \n I will say within the state of Michigan, there is a sales and use tax that exists where there's roughly a dozen states that have the sales and use tax in place, about 6%. There is an exemption process as being a build that are being considered in the House and Senate. It's passed the House in a bipartisan way. It's moved over to the Senate for consideration. We think that's going to move forward, that exemption, probably in the June, July time frame at the end of the session before they go on summer break. And that will open up Michigan a bit more for that pipeline. \n There are companies that are exploring Michigan right now, large data center providers, names that you would recognize. But again, it's a little bit -- they're testing the water in a lot of different locations. And so we'll see how Michigan progresses. We're certainly an attractive place to do business, and we'll look to track that low growth appropriately. \n And but as I stated in my previous remarks, we want to make sure there's a good balance that they're picking up the costs associated with that load as well, both from an energy and capacity perspective. So that's all the things that work in the balance, David. Hopefully, that provides some light to your question. Let me know if I didn't strike the right balance there. We've got a -- we have -- between the manufacturing load this contract and the data center load that's contracted. As Rejji said, it's a nice piece of load growth that we factored in the later years of this 5-year plan, but future 5-year plans. And we're excited about what that means. And there's a strong pipeline, both from a manufacturing perspective and to a degree, the data center perspective as well. I'd be disappointed if some of those projects in the pipeline didn't materialize. That's progressed in a constructive way. We had close to 10 or a dozen metrics that were originally proposed. It's narrowed to 4 metrics that are benchmarkable and there's good standards. And so again, a constructive process plays out. There's more work to do from our perspective when we filed comments in the February, March time frame. \n We're expecting a report from the Michigan Public Service Commission staff in May, and so we'll see the next round of thinking. I would suggest that a couple of electric rate cases away, not this case, perhaps the next case before we see implementation. But again, this is an evolving process with the Public Service Commission. Similar to Rejji's comments, from an energy perspective, energy tools and a capacity of the bilateral contracts, much of DIG has been spoken for at attractive -- really attractive position that either meets our expectations or is above our expectations. And so there's really unless you're beyond 2028, and maybe in the 2030s decade, DIG's really not available because it's already been secured and with, again, attractive energy tools and bilateral contracts for capacity. It is -- we got primaries in August, and that means early [indiscernible] balance start in June. And so its political season already in Michigan. And so I would anticipate that. Look, the Attorney General participates in all our cases, that's been a historical practice. Sometimes those are more public than other times. We stand, as I shared earlier, by the merits of the case, both in our gas case that's underway right now and this electric rate case. \n The team just went through a walk through this week, and I couldn't be more proud of the work the team's put together on it. As I shared earlier in my questions or responses to questions, we're focused on reliability. That's going to improve for our customers. That is absolutely the right thing to do, well aligned with the Public Service Commission. \n We're working hard to create affordability, and we're good at that through the CE Way, the reducing power supply cost, their unit costs from execution of capital. And when you get that mix right, that equation, right, it makes it I mean you get good outcomes. And so I'm excited about this case. It's certainly going to be a step-up in capital. There's going to be some O&M work too, that's focused on reliability, but there's also some offsets that are really exciting that make us -- get me excited, as you can tell by the tone of my voice about what we're filing and what we put it together because it's going to be good for customers, and it's going to be good for all stakeholders. Yes. The short answer is yes. But again, important work from a capital investment perspective and reliability, and we've done a lot to offset some of the O&M costs components of this to strike that right balance. And that's what I mean by the important fundamentals or merits of the case. No. The team seems excited about the opportunity to get to the table. Now that we have staff position now that we know where intervenors are at, to talk settlement. And as I shared, we've been able to navigate that with success in the past with all interveners, all stakeholders. And so we'll look to do that, but also hear my confidence in the merits of the case that if we need to go to full distance, we will. And I know that will get a good outcome for our customers and for stakeholders. Thanks, Drew. I'd like to thank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing you on the road soon. Take care and stay safe."
