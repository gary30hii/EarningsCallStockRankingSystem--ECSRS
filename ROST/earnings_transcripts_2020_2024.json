        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, COVID-related costs and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2019 Form 10-K and fiscal 2020 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2020 performance, followed by our outlook for 2021. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, our fourth quarter sales results exceeded our expectations. That said, the upsurge of COVID-19 resulted in lower traffic, especially in California, our largest state, where we were subject to more stringent occupancy and operating hour restrictions.  \n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2021 were $0.67 on net income of $238 million. Total sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion with comparable store sales down 6%. For the 2020 fiscal year, earnings per share were $0.24 on net income of $85 million. These results include a onetime pretax charge of $240 million or $0.54 per share for the year from the refinancing of $775 million in senior notes. Total sales for 2020 declined to $12.5 billion.  \n Let's turn now to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, the best-performing major merchandise area was home, while the Southeast and Midwest were the strongest regions. For the quarter, our largest states of California, Texas and Florida significantly underperformed the chain average.  \n Dd's DISCOUNTS business was also impacted by the COVID-19 issues, although to a lesser degree than Ross, given a smaller number of border and tourist locations. As we ended 2020, total consolidated inventories were down 18% versus the prior year with packaway levels at 38% of the total compared to last year's 46%. Average store inventories at year-end were down 16% from 2019 levels.  \n As noted in today's release, our Board recently approved the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend at a rate of $0.285 per share. The resumption of our dividend payout in 2021 reflects our strong cash position and our confidence in the company's long-term prospects.  \n Now Travis Marquette will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our first quarter guidance and general outlook for fiscal 2021. \nTravis Marquette: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales declined 6% in the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower traffic, which reflects customers' increased hesitancy to shop during the upsurge of the virus. This was partially offset by an increase in the size of the average basket.  \n Fourth quarter operating margin was 9.5% compared to 13.3% last year. Cost of goods sold increased 125 basis points in the quarter. Our merchandise margin gain of 70 basis points was more than offset by higher costs, including freight, which increased 100 basis points due to ongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion. Buying costs were higher by 50 basis points. Occupancy delevered 30 basis points on lower sales volume. Lastly, distribution costs grew 15 basis points, primarily due to higher wages, but were mostly offset by the favorable timing of packaway expenses.  \n SG&A for the quarter rose 260 basis points, mainly due to the deleveraging effect from the decline in comparable store sales, higher COVID-related operating expenses and timing of incentive costs. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $40 million, with a higher impact to SG&A than cost of goods sold.  \n Turning to our balance sheet. We exited 2020 in a strong financial position with over $5.6 billion in liquidity, which includes an unrestricted cash balance of about $4.8 billion and our $800 million revolver that remains fully available.  \n Now let's discuss our outlook for 2021. Our guidance and results throughout fiscal 2021 will be reported versus fiscal 2019. We believe the significant impact from the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020, and the ongoing headwinds caused by COVID-19 throughout last year make this a more relevant basis for comparison.  \n As we enter 2021, there remains limited visibility regarding the ongoing pandemic and the pace and magnitude of an economic recovery. As a result, we are providing specific guidance for only the first quarter and a general outlook for the year.  \n Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections for this period are compared to the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019. While we hoped to do better, total sales are projected to be down 1% to up 4%, with comparable store sales down 1% to down 5%. This sales guidance reflects the potential impacts of lower demand during this year's Easter selling season and ongoing supply chain congestion. Earnings per share are projected to be $0.74 to $0.86.  \n The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: We project operating margin to be 9.9% to 10.8% versus 14.1% in 2019. This forecast reflects the deleveraging effect from the projected decline in comparable store sales and ongoing expense headwinds from increased supply chain costs and higher wages. In addition, COVID-related expenses will remain elevated and are projected to negatively impact EBIT margins by approximately 50 basis points in the period. While we expect to continue the aggressive expansion of our 2 chains, we planned a more moderate pace of openings this year, especially in the spring. \n During the first quarter, we expect to open 4 Ross and 3 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $20 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 356 million.  \n As mentioned earlier, we are only providing a general outlook for the year at this time. From a top line perspective, with the continued rollout of vaccines, potential additional government stimulus and likely pent-up consumer demand, we expect sales trends to strengthen as we move through the year. Similar to the first quarter, though, we are projecting that operating margin relative to 2019 will continue to be affected by increased supply chain costs, higher wages and COVID-related expenses. Therefore, profitability will be well below recent historical high levels. We expect to add about 60 stores, consisting of approximately 40 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. \n As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest expense for the year is estimated to be about $76 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24% to 25%. We are planning average diluted shares outstanding to be about 356 million. Capital expenditures for 2021 are projected to be approximately $700 million, which includes investments for our next distribution center and the resumption of projects deferred from 2020. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $495 million.  \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Travis. To sum up, fiscal 2020 was an extremely difficult and challenging year. Like so many other retailers and businesses, our operations and financial results reflect the major problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, the combination of our proven and experienced leadership teams, seasoned associates throughout the company and strong financial foundation and liquidity has enabled us to navigate through this health crisis.  \n Looking at the balance of 2021, as Travis alluded to, many unknowns remain. However, over the longer term, we believe both Ross and dd's are well positioned in the off-price sector as consumers continue to favor retailers focused on delivering both value and convenience. This is especially true given the number of retail closures and bankruptcies over the past several years. Our mission is to continue delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. We remain confident that our unwavering focus on the successful execution of this core strategy will continue to be the key driver of our success.  \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I wanted to get your thoughts on the long-term profitability outlook for Ross. It seems like a lot of the cost that you're calling out are transient and COVID-related. So as you think out to a more normalized sales environment in '22 and '23, how do you think about the return -- the trajectory of the return to prior profitability levels? \nMichael Hartshorn: Lorraine, it's Michael Hartshorn. As we mentioned, the cost pressures this year between freight, COVID cost and wage pressures, there are some that we didn't have pre-COVID. And with lower sales productivity, we do lose leverage on fixed costs. So I would say it's hard to say at this point, as it's highly dependent on comp store sales recovery and thus average leverage we get on higher average sales per store. I'd say, with our visibility right now, it's hard to say how long the cost would linger. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I was hoping you could give us a bit more color on the real estate front. Just given the significant market share opportunities that are out there, just maybe walk us through the thought process on the more conservative pace of store openings this year. And how should we think about the potential to reaccelerate back to that prior run rate of around 100 per year? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the real estate, we made the decision last year during the peak of the pandemic, when all stores were temporarily closed, to take a more conservative approach for our 2021 openings, especially in the spring. I'd say at this point, we're committed to expanding our 2 chains, both in existing and new markets. And our plan would be to return to more normal opening cadence next year, again, assuming no extraordinary issues similar to the ones we experienced in 2020. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if you could provide any color on monthly performance during the quarter. And if you could share any more specifics about California versus Texas versus Florida? And then second, as you've been dealing with wage pressures in the past several years in some key states, I'm curious if you would also say that you tend to see an improvement in sales results in those states as well as the consumer gets the benefit from those higher wages. \nTravis Marquette: So let me take the first couple. In terms of month-to-month progression, again, generally, we don't talk about intra-quarter trends. That said, it's -- we discussed in November, we did mention at the time that comps were down mid-single digits to start the quarter. Beyond that, we did see a benefit to sales later in the quarter as shelter-in-place orders were lifted in California and as new stimulus payments were issued. \n Relative to sort of Texas, California, Florida, we wouldn't get into the details of each of them specifically. But as we mentioned, collectively, they significantly underperformed the chain. And in particular, during the quarter, California was impacted by increased occupancy restrictions and curfews as well as the shelter-in-place order. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the wage front, Paul, it's really hard to tease out any impact from higher wages and correlate that to sales with all the different factors that we're seeing in the business today. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: I wanted to just check if your stores are currently all open and less encumbered or less hindered by some of the capacity restrictions you were facing in the fourth quarter. The guidance -- the better revenue guidance here for Q1 would seem to suggest that, but I just wanted to confirm that. And then on the supply chain cost, I'm wondering if you can talk about the various pieces in there that are currently pressuring supply chain costs? And it's hard to guess when the world might be normal again. But if there are any supply chain costs in there that you feel like are more temporary in nature, it would be interesting to hear about those as well. \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on the occupancy restrictions, during the fourth quarter, about 70% of our stores were under some level of capacity restrictions, including states like Nevada, Weston and of course, as we mentioned, California. Also during the quarter, we had about 35 stores that were closed for some period of time. As of today, all stores are open, although we still have occupancy restrictions in a number of states, although I would say the impact during this time of year versus peak holiday selling season is less. \nTravis Marquette: And on your question on the supply chain cost, there's a couple of components to that. First, I'd speak to freight, which really, there's 2 parts to that. There's domestic freight as well as ocean freight costs, which are significantly higher. There's also ongoing wage pressure, which we spoke to. Some of the actions that we took last year will clearly carry over. And then beyond that, COVID is also driving higher costs in the supply chain.  \n In terms of how long those will last, again, it's hard to say. From where we sit today, it feels like the freight costs will continue through the year. It's one of the reasons why we called that out in our commentary. And obviously, the wage pressures, we made those increases in wages in the third quarter. And so those would carry through until then. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just I was wondering if you guys could speak to the mix of Home as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter and also all of 2020? And I guess, how you're thinking about the Home category for this upcoming year. And then also if you could speak to the contribution margins within the Home category itself relative to apparel. Just wondering how big of the difference there is? \nTravis Marquette: In terms of the product mix, we wouldn't give specific details by quarter. Our total for the year, Home was about 28% compared to about 25% last year. In terms of contribution margins, again, I think the contribution margins for that are relatively similar. There's some puts and takes in terms of markup and costs, but in general, the contribution margin is similar. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons from RBC Capital Markets. \nKate Fitzsimons: I guess, just on inventory, packaway as a percent of total inventory was down year-on-year, but it does seem like it is building sequentially relative to the third quarter. I guess, just how we should evaluate the rebuild on packaway go forward? And then just looking out, your ability to generate, I guess, merchandise margin improvement relative to 2019 looking out the next few quarters, that would be helpful. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of the builds of packaway, we used part of packaway to support our planned sales in the fourth quarter. So yes, the rebuild -- it has rebuilt since the third quarter, and our intention is that it will continue to build to more historical levels. But we did use that to chase part of the sales increase. \nTravis Marquette: And then in terms of merchandise margins, again, we're not providing specific guidance beyond the first quarter. What I'd say, in Q4, merchandise margins were impacted by a couple of things. One, the favorable buying environment that we spoke about in Q3 carried forward to some extent. But then we had a significant negative impact from the higher ocean freight costs, which for us are included in merch margin. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I was wondering if you can talk about the availability of inventory, both in quality and quantity? And whether the West Coast port congestion is impacting that availability? And then for Michael, can you talk about sort of this COVID pressure, the 50 basis points during -- in the period? How should that diminish over time? Do you expect that to kind of go forward into the second quarter and then kind of diminish in the back half of the year? \nBarbara Rentler: So Adrienne, in terms of availability in quality and quantity, we're still seeing pretty great supply opportunities in the marketplace. What I would say is the West Coast port congestion, obviously, has slowed down some of receipts coming into the country. So the merchants are constantly moving and shaking based off of what's coming in. \n In terms of the end state of availability from the disruption of the port, I think at some point, there'll be a bubble. I don't think we've seen that bubble yet. But at some point, historically, when things start to self correct, there'll be a bubble of inventory, so that would be an indication. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Opportunity. \nTravis Marquette: And then in terms of -- this is Travis. In terms of COVID costs, we're not providing specific guidance beyond the first quarter. However, we currently expect COVID costs to be somewhat similar to Q1 throughout the year, given our expectation for continued investments to keep associates and customers safe. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Travis, just a quick question. I know you're not giving explicit guidance, but we know the margin guide for 1Q relative to '19, understanding that you don't expect margins to get back to '19 levels based on your commentary, is it fair to say that there should be a -- basically a glide path upward as we move throughout the year? Or is there reason to believe that there could be some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter just in that regard? Any help there would be great. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. You're right. As we mentioned, we're not providing specific guidance. I think I would sort of come back to the comments that Michael made. Our profitability is going to be significantly connected to, as you would expect, our sales. And as we're able to drive higher same-store sales, that should -- we should see improvements in profitability. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: I just want to ask you about the down 5% to down 1% comp guidance for Q1 versus Q1 of '19. Is the current trend that you've seen quarter-to-date in line with that? Or are you performing better or worse? And then would you say that like things like delayed tax refunds or bad weather in Texas has impacted your February comp? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't talk specifically about quarter-to-date trends. That was our process prior to last year when we needed to report related to COVID. But I would tell you that the guidance reflects both the tax refund delays and also what we saw in Texas in February in weather throughout the country. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Barbara, I just want to clarify, because I had in my questions, typically, things like port disruptions, while bad, ends up being good for you guys with opportunity. And did you -- that's what you were referring to when you talk about the bubble that once this all settles out, there will be probably outsized opportunity additional on top of what's already out there. \nBarbara Rentler: Correct, Marni, that's what you would expect. Although we're still seeing great supply opportunities out there, because of things, the supplies and the moves that are going on, we would expect that at some point, that would back up and that there would be an opportunity. That's what history would tell us. So that's what I would think would happen. \nMarni Shapiro: Makes a lot of sense. And then just following up on the packaway comment for holiday. I know Mother's Day, Father's Day, events like that, even Easter, you guys have had a long history of packing away, let's use the example of polo shirts for Father's Day. Given the disruptions, do you feel like you're well set up for these holidays? I know you're planning Easter is going to be a little more muted potentially, but are you set up for gifting for Mother's Day and Father's Day with what you have on order and with packaways? \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. I feel comfortable with that. Yes. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. \nJamie Merriman: Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about use of cash? Good to see the dividend get reinstated. And I'm just wondering if there's any markers that you're looking for from a revenue perspective or profitability before you might think about resuming buybacks? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the -- on shareholder returns, our preference has long been a consistent and measured approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. The dividend decision, it made sense for us to restart the dividend first, as it requires a lower cash outlay, especially given the uncertain environment. I'd say we remain very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And we'll continue to assess additional shareholder payout actions once we have more sustained visibility on the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. \nJanine Stichter: I wanted to ask a bit about the category performance. Obviously, you called out the strength in Home. Wondering if you're seeing any green shoots in apparel? And if so, how you're feeling about your ability to chase into that category, if and when we get the customer having some more appetite for the category? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. The performance in Home has been very broad-based. I mean, Home is just taking -- in total, has taken a lift. And Home in the fourth quarter, in particular, has a lot of gift-giving businesses. So that was a big part of the performance also. \n In terms of seeing life in some parts of apparel, I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is the continuation of casual being very strong, whether it's activewear or casual just type products, whether it's denim or shirts. And I think the other businesses, we're watching them closely to see if they start to come to life. When I'd say that Q2 was traditionally a better -- Q2 is traditionally a better apparel quarter than Q1, and we're watching it. And then the merchants will make the shift, and we'll chase it. A lot of those classifications of business have availability. And so we're watching every week to see where the customer is going, and we'll make the shift just the way we made the shift the last time into more money into Home and casual and all the businesses on the way into the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Can you elaborate a little bit on the SG&A puts and takes of how you're thinking of it for 2021? Anything on expenses, particularly in occupancy, that would be a benefit? And lastly, on dd's, do they get more of a benefit from stimulus than you're seeing in Ross? And if so, how are you seeing the difference when you have seen stimulus? \nTravis Marquette: Dana, in terms of specific details for 2021, I really wouldn't get into the specifics beyond the level of detail that we've provided, other than to say, again, we think the significant cost pressures that we're seeing in Q1 around lower average sales per store, higher supply chain costs, higher wages, which, to some extent, will impact stores, particularly compared to 2019, and in COVID-related expenses, which impacts both SG&A and cost of sales, those will continue. \nMichael Hartshorn: And Dana, on the dd's customer, I think history would say, whether it's tax refunds or stimulus, we -- the dd's customer is more sensitive to stimulus payments than, frankly, tax refunds. So we would expect to see a more immediate impact in the dd's business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Just curious on your confidence in the ability to rebuild inventory as we go into the back half of the year. Are your key vendors, particularly in apparel, going to have enough inventory to service you to comp off of 2019 levels? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, we feel confident based off our plan that we would be able to rebuild our inventory in apparel. Part of that will come from chase, part of it will come from packaway, part of it will come from goods that we might buy in advance of the season. So it will be a combination of all 3 things. And in terms of the market having supply, I think most vendors will have some supply. I think some vendors are bringing in supply earlier. So I think it will be a mix based on who the vendor structure is. But I feel confident that we can get back into the inventory position we need to get into. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: It's on COVID-related costs, which my understanding, Michael, is that you expect Q1's level to continue throughout the year. How would that compare to your total COVID-related spend in 2020? \nTravis Marquette: Yes, this is Travis. If it plays out exactly that way, and again, we don't know if it exactly will, that would be a bit lower than what we incurred in 2020. \nLaura Champine: And then just housekeeping. You mentioned timing and incentive comp, which pushed your Q4 SG&A expense higher. Can you be more specific on how much pressure that was? \nTravis Marquette: Yes, I wouldn't specifically quantify it, but just a little bit more color on that. Again, the timing of incentives related to management incentive costs, overall, management incentive costs for the year were down, which you'd expect given our performance. But they were more heavily weighted to the back half, given the timing of when we finalized our incentive comp plans for the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Just 2 questions for me. The first one is when you look at average inventories in the stores down 16%, is there a wide variation? I mean, in terms of when you think about the stores in California, Texas, Florida, how you're inventorying those stores versus the other stores. And the second question is, just wondering if you had any change in your long-term store potential, either the Ross Stores or dd's, given continued bankruptcies and store closures throughout the industry? \nMichael Hartshorn: Bob, on inventory, given the ongoing uncertainty, we had planned inventory down, fairly broad-based across the chain. Of course, we pay attention to churns by region. And regions that were underperforming, we would have less inventory there to maximize profitability.  \n And then on store potential, it's -- the real estate availability is very good, and it's possible that the number could grow given that availability. However, at this time, we continue to believe 3,000 stores is the appropriate long-term growth potential for the company, and that includes 2,400 Ross and 600 dd's. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners. \nRoxanne Meyer: I wanted to dig into CapEx a bit. I know, in part, you said you're investing in the distribution center. I'm just wondering if, costs related to that, the expenses are expected to hit in 2021 and are included in your outlook? And secondly, I'm wondering if you could talk about some of the projects, the key projects that you've got that were deferred in 2020 that you're focusing on now. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. I wouldn't go into specific details on the project, but I can give you a little bit more color on capital expenditure plans. As I mentioned, we expect to spend around $700 million this year. Around half of that we would expect to spend on our distribution centers and supply chain projects in general. About 20% of that would be for maintenance and remodels of existing stores, about 15% for new stores and then the balance in IT and other. \n In regards to DC cost impact on the P&L this year, at this point, we're expecting the new distribution center to open sometime in early 2022. And so those costs would hit the P&L once the DC opens, so they wouldn't impact this year. \nMichael Hartshorn: Roxanne, on the deferral of capital, given our goal of improving liquidity last year, we had a lot of maintenance-type projects that we deferred into this year. So that capital forecast for this year, whether it's store maintenance projects, things of that nature, we're catching up in this year's plan. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Matt Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Barbara, maybe to think about this a slightly different way or more on the positive side. So your brick-and-mortar-only retailer, you're guiding to negative low to mid-single-digit comp in the middle of the pandemic. I guess, how do you view the off-price opportunity to take market share in apparel exiting the pandemic? And anything that you've seen that makes you question either the value or the convenience component of Ross going forward. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Off-price taking market share in apparel as we move forward, yes, when you think about all the store closures that have happened out there and our continued growth, I think that we have the ability to gain share. Let me start with that. \n That will build and grow over time. Based off of our large vendor base and our large merchant team, we should be able to drive sales and go forward and offer assortments that are perhaps broader than other businesses and other types of models. So I do feel comfortable that when apparel gets back on track, that we will move in that direction, and that off-price has an opportunity in grand total to gain share, whether it's -- quite frankly, whether it's in apparel or whether it's in Home or other products. \n In terms of value and -- our value and convenience and how we rank on value and convenience, we know from customer surveys that value is one of the things that our customer really gives us high marks on. It's a very competitive market, as you know. And the merchants are constantly out there shopping and trying to get the best deal and really understanding what's going on around them. But most importantly, that's what the customer tells us, that she gives us, I would say, good grades on. And that is a focus, and that is the main focus of us every day. That is our mission is to deliver the best branded bargains possible. \n So in value, I would say that I would give us high scores in convenience, again, getting data back from the customers based off of where our stores are located and how easy it is for the customer to shop and certainly in our key markets where we have a lot of stores, it could be on one side of a road and go to a Ross and look across the highway and see another Ross on the way on the other way. So whether I'm going to or from work, I can go to a Ross store. \n So I think those are 2 things we know the customer values. Those are 2 things that, as a company, we get behind and really protect because that is an important part of us being able to pick up market share as we go forward. And as we know with all the store closures, there's a lot of potential market share to be had. So that is a company focus. \nOperator: Your last question comes from Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: I guess I'm trying to think of -- I guess, 2 quick ones, if you could. I'm trying to think a little bit about how you built the range of same-store sales that you looked at for the first quarter from the negative 5% to negative 1%. And just maybe the different scenarios, what you think it takes to get to the negative 1%. And I guess it's reasonable -- it seems to me like it's reasonable to assume, based on your comment for sequential progress, that, that scenario turns positive in the second quarter. It might be a little earlier for you to endorse that, but just how you thought about it. \n And then on SG&A, I was trying to look at it a little bit of a different way that on a per-foot basis, it looks like it grew about 11% in the fourth quarter. I know there was some timing that you guys ran over on the incentive comp. But Michael, it sounds like the sales deleverage is the biggest input for that. And I know you won't know that until you know it, but maybe you could just help us think about how much we should back up on a per-foot basis as far as we think about what kind of cost inflation rolls forward, at least the first half of the year, if you have any visibility there. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the comp trend, I would just say, we did a minus 6% in the fourth quarter, and that included, as we mentioned a number of times here that California had stay-at-home orders and restrictions. And with the cases improving the potential for increase in vaccinations, the first quarter really just represents a sequential improvement over the fourth quarter. \nTravis Marquette: And on G&A cost, again, it's really hard to sort of quantify, I think, an answer your question in an easy, concise way. But of the pressures that we talked about for the year, obviously, higher wages relative to 2019 will certainly impact G&A cost. COVID will certainly impact G&A costs. That will probably -- I would expect more likely to be continually -- continue to be a little bit more weighted towards G&A going forward. And so those are some of the pressures, but I couldn't give you a specific inflation factor for your model. \nOperator: I will now turn the call over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2020 performance, followed by our outlook for 2021. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, our fourth quarter sales results exceeded our expectations. That said, the upsurge of COVID-19 resulted in lower traffic, especially in California, our largest state, where we were subject to more stringent occupancy and operating hour restrictions.  \n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 30, 2021 were $0.67 on net income of $238 million. Total sales for the quarter were $4.2 billion with comparable store sales down 6%. For the 2020 fiscal year, earnings per share were $0.24 on net income of $85 million. These results include a onetime pretax charge of $240 million or $0.54 per share for the year from the refinancing of $775 million in senior notes. Total sales for 2020 declined to $12.5 billion.  \n Let's turn now to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, the best-performing major merchandise area was home, while the Southeast and Midwest were the strongest regions. For the quarter, our largest states of California, Texas and Florida significantly underperformed the chain average.  \n Dd's DISCOUNTS business was also impacted by the COVID-19 issues, although to a lesser degree than Ross, given a smaller number of border and tourist locations. As we ended 2020, total consolidated inventories were down 18% versus the prior year with packaway levels at 38% of the total compared to last year's 46%. Average store inventories at year-end were down 16% from 2019 levels.  \n As noted in today's release, our Board recently approved the reinstatement of our quarterly cash dividend at a rate of $0.285 per share. The resumption of our dividend payout in 2021 reflects our strong cash position and our confidence in the company's long-term prospects.  \n Now Travis Marquette will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our first quarter guidance and general outlook for fiscal 2021. Thank you, Travis. To sum up, fiscal 2020 was an extremely difficult and challenging year. Like so many other retailers and businesses, our operations and financial results reflect the major problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. That said, the combination of our proven and experienced leadership teams, seasoned associates throughout the company and strong financial foundation and liquidity has enabled us to navigate through this health crisis.  \n Looking at the balance of 2021, as Travis alluded to, many unknowns remain. However, over the longer term, we believe both Ross and dd's are well positioned in the off-price sector as consumers continue to favor retailers focused on delivering both value and convenience. This is especially true given the number of retail closures and bankruptcies over the past several years. Our mission is to continue delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. We remain confident that our unwavering focus on the successful execution of this core strategy will continue to be the key driver of our success.  \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. Sure. In terms of the builds of packaway, we used part of packaway to support our planned sales in the fourth quarter. So yes, the rebuild -- it has rebuilt since the third quarter, and our intention is that it will continue to build to more historical levels. But we did use that to chase part of the sales increase. So Adrienne, in terms of availability in quality and quantity, we're still seeing pretty great supply opportunities in the marketplace. What I would say is the West Coast port congestion, obviously, has slowed down some of receipts coming into the country. So the merchants are constantly moving and shaking based off of what's coming in. \n In terms of the end state of availability from the disruption of the port, I think at some point, there'll be a bubble. I don't think we've seen that bubble yet. But at some point, historically, when things start to self correct, there'll be a bubble of inventory, so that would be an indication. Correct, Marni, that's what you would expect. Although we're still seeing great supply opportunities out there, because of things, the supplies and the moves that are going on, we would expect that at some point, that would back up and that there would be an opportunity. That's what history would tell us. So that's what I would think would happen. Yes. I feel comfortable with that. Yes. Sure. The performance in Home has been very broad-based. I mean, Home is just taking -- in total, has taken a lift. And Home in the fourth quarter, in particular, has a lot of gift-giving businesses. So that was a big part of the performance also. \n In terms of seeing life in some parts of apparel, I mean, I think what we saw in the fourth quarter is the continuation of casual being very strong, whether it's activewear or casual just type products, whether it's denim or shirts. And I think the other businesses, we're watching them closely to see if they start to come to life. When I'd say that Q2 was traditionally a better -- Q2 is traditionally a better apparel quarter than Q1, and we're watching it. And then the merchants will make the shift, and we'll chase it. A lot of those classifications of business have availability. And so we're watching every week to see where the customer is going, and we'll make the shift just the way we made the shift the last time into more money into Home and casual and all the businesses on the way into the fourth quarter. Well, we feel confident based off our plan that we would be able to rebuild our inventory in apparel. Part of that will come from chase, part of it will come from packaway, part of it will come from goods that we might buy in advance of the season. So it will be a combination of all 3 things. And in terms of the market having supply, I think most vendors will have some supply. I think some vendors are bringing in supply earlier. So I think it will be a mix based on who the vendor structure is. But I feel confident that we can get back into the inventory position we need to get into. Sure. Off-price taking market share in apparel as we move forward, yes, when you think about all the store closures that have happened out there and our continued growth, I think that we have the ability to gain share. Let me start with that. \n That will build and grow over time. Based off of our large vendor base and our large merchant team, we should be able to drive sales and go forward and offer assortments that are perhaps broader than other businesses and other types of models. So I do feel comfortable that when apparel gets back on track, that we will move in that direction, and that off-price has an opportunity in grand total to gain share, whether it's -- quite frankly, whether it's in apparel or whether it's in Home or other products. \n In terms of value and -- our value and convenience and how we rank on value and convenience, we know from customer surveys that value is one of the things that our customer really gives us high marks on. It's a very competitive market, as you know. And the merchants are constantly out there shopping and trying to get the best deal and really understanding what's going on around them. But most importantly, that's what the customer tells us, that she gives us, I would say, good grades on. And that is a focus, and that is the main focus of us every day. That is our mission is to deliver the best branded bargains possible. \n So in value, I would say that I would give us high scores in convenience, again, getting data back from the customers based off of where our stores are located and how easy it is for the customer to shop and certainly in our key markets where we have a lot of stores, it could be on one side of a road and go to a Ross and look across the highway and see another Ross on the way on the other way. So whether I'm going to or from work, I can go to a Ross store. \n So I think those are 2 things we know the customer values. Those are 2 things that, as a company, we get behind and really protect because that is an important part of us being able to pick up market share as we go forward. And as we know with all the store closures, there's a lot of potential market share to be had. So that is a company focus. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Lorraine, it's Michael Hartshorn. As we mentioned, the cost pressures this year between freight, COVID cost and wage pressures, there are some that we didn't have pre-COVID. And with lower sales productivity, we do lose leverage on fixed costs. So I would say it's hard to say at this point, as it's highly dependent on comp store sales recovery and thus average leverage we get on higher average sales per store. I'd say, with our visibility right now, it's hard to say how long the cost would linger. On the real estate, we made the decision last year during the peak of the pandemic, when all stores were temporarily closed, to take a more conservative approach for our 2021 openings, especially in the spring. I'd say at this point, we're committed to expanding our 2 chains, both in existing and new markets. And our plan would be to return to more normal opening cadence next year, again, assuming no extraordinary issues similar to the ones we experienced in 2020. On the wage front, Paul, it's really hard to tease out any impact from higher wages and correlate that to sales with all the different factors that we're seeing in the business today. Kimberly, on the occupancy restrictions, during the fourth quarter, about 70% of our stores were under some level of capacity restrictions, including states like Nevada, Weston and of course, as we mentioned, California. Also during the quarter, we had about 35 stores that were closed for some period of time. As of today, all stores are open, although we still have occupancy restrictions in a number of states, although I would say the impact during this time of year versus peak holiday selling season is less. We wouldn't talk specifically about quarter-to-date trends. That was our process prior to last year when we needed to report related to COVID. But I would tell you that the guidance reflects both the tax refund delays and also what we saw in Texas in February in weather throughout the country. On the -- on shareholder returns, our preference has long been a consistent and measured approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. The dividend decision, it made sense for us to restart the dividend first, as it requires a lower cash outlay, especially given the uncertain environment. I'd say we remain very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And we'll continue to assess additional shareholder payout actions once we have more sustained visibility on the business. And Dana, on the dd's customer, I think history would say, whether it's tax refunds or stimulus, we -- the dd's customer is more sensitive to stimulus payments than, frankly, tax refunds. So we would expect to see a more immediate impact in the dd's business. Bob, on inventory, given the ongoing uncertainty, we had planned inventory down, fairly broad-based across the chain. Of course, we pay attention to churns by region. And regions that were underperforming, we would have less inventory there to maximize profitability.  \n And then on store potential, it's -- the real estate availability is very good, and it's possible that the number could grow given that availability. However, at this time, we continue to believe 3,000 stores is the appropriate long-term growth potential for the company, and that includes 2,400 Ross and 600 dd's. Roxanne, on the deferral of capital, given our goal of improving liquidity last year, we had a lot of maintenance-type projects that we deferred into this year. So that capital forecast for this year, whether it's store maintenance projects, things of that nature, we're catching up in this year's plan. On the comp trend, I would just say, we did a minus 6% in the fourth quarter, and that included, as we mentioned a number of times here that California had stay-at-home orders and restrictions. And with the cases improving the potential for increase in vaccinations, the first quarter really just represents a sequential improvement over the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Travis Marquette",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales declined 6% in the quarter. This decrease was driven by lower traffic, which reflects customers' increased hesitancy to shop during the upsurge of the virus. This was partially offset by an increase in the size of the average basket.  \n Fourth quarter operating margin was 9.5% compared to 13.3% last year. Cost of goods sold increased 125 basis points in the quarter. Our merchandise margin gain of 70 basis points was more than offset by higher costs, including freight, which increased 100 basis points due to ongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion. Buying costs were higher by 50 basis points. Occupancy delevered 30 basis points on lower sales volume. Lastly, distribution costs grew 15 basis points, primarily due to higher wages, but were mostly offset by the favorable timing of packaway expenses.  \n SG&A for the quarter rose 260 basis points, mainly due to the deleveraging effect from the decline in comparable store sales, higher COVID-related operating expenses and timing of incentive costs. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $40 million, with a higher impact to SG&A than cost of goods sold.  \n Turning to our balance sheet. We exited 2020 in a strong financial position with over $5.6 billion in liquidity, which includes an unrestricted cash balance of about $4.8 billion and our $800 million revolver that remains fully available.  \n Now let's discuss our outlook for 2021. Our guidance and results throughout fiscal 2021 will be reported versus fiscal 2019. We believe the significant impact from the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020, and the ongoing headwinds caused by COVID-19 throughout last year make this a more relevant basis for comparison.  \n As we enter 2021, there remains limited visibility regarding the ongoing pandemic and the pace and magnitude of an economic recovery. As a result, we are providing specific guidance for only the first quarter and a general outlook for the year.  \n Let's move now to our first quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections for this period are compared to the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019. While we hoped to do better, total sales are projected to be down 1% to up 4%, with comparable store sales down 1% to down 5%. This sales guidance reflects the potential impacts of lower demand during this year's Easter selling season and ongoing supply chain congestion. Earnings per share are projected to be $0.74 to $0.86.  \n The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: We project operating margin to be 9.9% to 10.8% versus 14.1% in 2019. This forecast reflects the deleveraging effect from the projected decline in comparable store sales and ongoing expense headwinds from increased supply chain costs and higher wages. In addition, COVID-related expenses will remain elevated and are projected to negatively impact EBIT margins by approximately 50 basis points in the period. While we expect to continue the aggressive expansion of our 2 chains, we planned a more moderate pace of openings this year, especially in the spring. \n During the first quarter, we expect to open 4 Ross and 3 dd's DISCOUNTS locations during the period. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $20 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%. And finally, weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 356 million.  \n As mentioned earlier, we are only providing a general outlook for the year at this time. From a top line perspective, with the continued rollout of vaccines, potential additional government stimulus and likely pent-up consumer demand, we expect sales trends to strengthen as we move through the year. Similar to the first quarter, though, we are projecting that operating margin relative to 2019 will continue to be affected by increased supply chain costs, higher wages and COVID-related expenses. Therefore, profitability will be well below recent historical high levels. We expect to add about 60 stores, consisting of approximately 40 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. \n As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest expense for the year is estimated to be about $76 million. Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24% to 25%. We are planning average diluted shares outstanding to be about 356 million. Capital expenditures for 2021 are projected to be approximately $700 million, which includes investments for our next distribution center and the resumption of projects deferred from 2020. And depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $495 million.  \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. So let me take the first couple. In terms of month-to-month progression, again, generally, we don't talk about intra-quarter trends. That said, it's -- we discussed in November, we did mention at the time that comps were down mid-single digits to start the quarter. Beyond that, we did see a benefit to sales later in the quarter as shelter-in-place orders were lifted in California and as new stimulus payments were issued. \n Relative to sort of Texas, California, Florida, we wouldn't get into the details of each of them specifically. But as we mentioned, collectively, they significantly underperformed the chain. And in particular, during the quarter, California was impacted by increased occupancy restrictions and curfews as well as the shelter-in-place order. And on your question on the supply chain cost, there's a couple of components to that. First, I'd speak to freight, which really, there's 2 parts to that. There's domestic freight as well as ocean freight costs, which are significantly higher. There's also ongoing wage pressure, which we spoke to. Some of the actions that we took last year will clearly carry over. And then beyond that, COVID is also driving higher costs in the supply chain.  \n In terms of how long those will last, again, it's hard to say. From where we sit today, it feels like the freight costs will continue through the year. It's one of the reasons why we called that out in our commentary. And obviously, the wage pressures, we made those increases in wages in the third quarter. And so those would carry through until then. In terms of the product mix, we wouldn't give specific details by quarter. Our total for the year, Home was about 28% compared to about 25% last year. In terms of contribution margins, again, I think the contribution margins for that are relatively similar. There's some puts and takes in terms of markup and costs, but in general, the contribution margin is similar. And then in terms of merchandise margins, again, we're not providing specific guidance beyond the first quarter. What I'd say, in Q4, merchandise margins were impacted by a couple of things. One, the favorable buying environment that we spoke about in Q3 carried forward to some extent. But then we had a significant negative impact from the higher ocean freight costs, which for us are included in merch margin. And then in terms of -- this is Travis. In terms of COVID costs, we're not providing specific guidance beyond the first quarter. However, we currently expect COVID costs to be somewhat similar to Q1 throughout the year, given our expectation for continued investments to keep associates and customers safe. Yes. You're right. As we mentioned, we're not providing specific guidance. I think I would sort of come back to the comments that Michael made. Our profitability is going to be significantly connected to, as you would expect, our sales. And as we're able to drive higher same-store sales, that should -- we should see improvements in profitability. Dana, in terms of specific details for 2021, I really wouldn't get into the specifics beyond the level of detail that we've provided, other than to say, again, we think the significant cost pressures that we're seeing in Q1 around lower average sales per store, higher supply chain costs, higher wages, which, to some extent, will impact stores, particularly compared to 2019, and in COVID-related expenses, which impacts both SG&A and cost of sales, those will continue. Yes, this is Travis. If it plays out exactly that way, and again, we don't know if it exactly will, that would be a bit lower than what we incurred in 2020. Yes, I wouldn't specifically quantify it, but just a little bit more color on that. Again, the timing of incentives related to management incentive costs, overall, management incentive costs for the year were down, which you'd expect given our performance. But they were more heavily weighted to the back half, given the timing of when we finalized our incentive comp plans for the year. Yes. I wouldn't go into specific details on the project, but I can give you a little bit more color on capital expenditure plans. As I mentioned, we expect to spend around $700 million this year. Around half of that we would expect to spend on our distribution centers and supply chain projects in general. About 20% of that would be for maintenance and remodels of existing stores, about 15% for new stores and then the balance in IT and other. \n In regards to DC cost impact on the P&L this year, at this point, we're expecting the new distribution center to open sometime in early 2022. And so those costs would hit the P&L once the DC opens, so they wouldn't impact this year. And on G&A cost, again, it's really hard to sort of quantify, I think, an answer your question in an easy, concise way. But of the pressures that we talked about for the year, obviously, higher wages relative to 2019 will certainly impact G&A cost. COVID will certainly impact G&A costs. That will probably -- I would expect more likely to be continually -- continue to be a little bit more weighted towards G&A going forward. And so those are some of the pressures, but I couldn't give you a specific inflation factor for your model."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call may contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future operations and financial results and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements and from historical performance or current expectations. Additional information about related risk factors is included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2019 Form 10-K and fiscal 2020 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n The vast majority of our stores were operating throughout the third quarter. That said, given the worsening pandemic, we will remain vigilant in monitoring local developments to assess any potential changes that might be necessary to our operations based on local state or other government directives. We will continue to make the health and well-being of our associates and customers a top priority.\n Turning now to our financial results. Total sales for the third quarter declined 2% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales down 3%. Sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter following a slower start in August. This acceleration was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our merchandise assortments, a later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets and our return to more normal store hours.\n In October, the company refinanced $775 million in senior notes to significantly reduce the annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. This action resulted in a onetime charge of $240 million or $0.65 per share impact to net earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Including this impact, for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2020, net income was $131 million or $0.37 per share compared to $371 million or $1.03 per share for the same period last year. Year-to-date, the loss per share was $0.43 on a net loss of $153 million, also including the aforementioned onetime charge. This compares to net income of $1.2 billion or $3.32 per share for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first 9 months of 2020 were $8.3 billion versus $11.6 billion last year.\n Third quarter operating margin of 4.4% was down from 12.4% last year and was negatively impacted by the onetime debt refinancing charge, which was equivalent to 640 basis points. In addition, the year-over-year margin decline reflects higher COVID-related operating costs in 2020 and the deleveraging effect on expenses throughout the business from the decline in same-store sales. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 25% from the prior year with average store inventories down 8%.\n During the period, we continued to make progress on our distribution capabilities to support peak sales during the holiday selling season. Packaway levels at quarter end were 26% of the total compared to last year's 39%. For the third quarter, the strongest merchandise areas at Ross was home, while the Midwest and the Southeast were the best-performing geographic regions. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS performance accelerated during the quarter as their value offering also resonated well with customers. Overall, our improved core business results demonstrates consumers' continued focus on value and our ongoing ability to deliver the bargains our customers come to expect from us.\n Turning to store growth. As expected, we opened 30 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our expansion program for 2020. After the planned closing of about 10 existing stores in the fourth quarter, we anticipate ending the year with 1,585 Ross and 274 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 54 for fiscal 2020.\n Now Travis will provide further color on third quarter results. \nTravis Marquette: Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara noted, comparable store sales decreased 3% versus last year. This decline was driven by a lower number of transactions that was partially offset by a larger average basket size.\n Again, as mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 4.4%, down from 12.4% last year. Cost of goods sold increased 35 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 190 basis points, driven by a favorable buying environment and lower inventory shortage. These items were more than offset by freight costs that rose 90 basis points and higher distribution expenses of 70 basis points. In addition, buying and occupancy delevered by 40 and 25 basis points, respectively.\n Selling and general and administrative expenses increased 765 basis points, which includes the previously mentioned 640 basis point impact from the onetime debt refinancing charge in addition to the deleveraging effect from the decline in same-store sales and higher COVID-related operating costs in 2020. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $25 million with a slightly higher impact to cost of goods sold than SG&A. We expect net COVID-related costs to be significantly higher in Q4 relative to Q3. These increases primarily relate to managing impact from industry-wide capacity constraints and congestion as well as wage and incentive actions in our supply chain and stores.\n Turning to our balance sheet. In addition to the refinancing of a portion of our senior notes during the third quarter, we also took several actions to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including the repayment of the $800 million revolving credit facility and terminating the undrawn $500 million revolver. Overall, we remain in a strong financial position, ending the quarter with over $5.2 billion in liquidity, which includes an unrestricted cash balance of about $4.4 billion and the $800 million revolver that remains available.\n As mentioned in our press release, entering the fourth quarter, our month-to-date comparable store sales in November are down mid-single digits. In addition, there remains a high level of uncertainty related to the worsening health crisis, and we are concerned with how the upsurge of this pandemic might impact consumer demand during what we expect to be a highly competitive holiday shopping season. Given the lack of visibility we have concerning these external risks and how they may evolve and impact our business, we will continue to manage our operations conservatively and will not be providing specific details or earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Travis. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we expect a highly competitive retail environment in a difficult economic and political atmosphere, both of which are complicated by our lack of visibility surrounding the worsening pandemic. Despite these near-term challenges, I want to emphasize that we have a talented and seasoned management team that we believe will enable us to effectively navigate through any short-term headwinds.\n Over the longer term, we remain well positioned in the off-price sector to gain market share, as we believe consumers will continue to favor retailers' focus on delivering value and convenience, both of which we have and will continue to provide to our customers.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And congrats on the improvement. So Barbara, could you help bridge improvement from negative mid-teens to start August and more or less flat comps for the remainder of the quarter? I think, would be the math. Are you happy with your inventory assortments today and the availability that you see out there with close-out product?\n And then larger picture, to touch on your comments, just given the stability that your model is showing in the midst of a pandemic, how do you see opportunity for the off-price model post pandemic as it relates to market share? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. First, in terms of our inventory assortments, I think as the quarter went on, the merchants did a fine job of actually chasing the goods in the market and shifting the assortments into the classifications that the customer is desiring, which is more home and things that are casual activewear.\n In terms of availability in the market, we're seeing availability pretty broad-based in most classifications, and there's plenty of supply, so we're not as worried about the supply.\n And in terms of stability of the model for off-price, as we go forward, look, I think when we get to the other side post pandemic, there's a customer who really likes shopping in stores, who enjoys the off-price model because there's a treasure hunt and the excitement, and I'll call it the fun, and also for retail stores that really focus on value and convenience, and that's really all those metrics to what the Ross model does. \nMichael Hartshorn: Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. I'll also add with the extraordinary large number of current and future retail closures, it does mean that she has fewer places to shop, and we think that off-price in general and Ross and dd's specifically are well positioned to gain market share post pandemic. \nMatthew Boss: Perfect. And then just to follow up on gross margin. Could you just walk through any puts and takes for us to consider in the fourth quarter gross margin? Anything preventing underlying merchandise margin expansion? \nTravis Marquette: Sure. This is Travis. We're not providing specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but a couple of comments on merchandise margins. We mentioned merch margin was up 190 basis points, driven by the favorable buying environment. We think there's -- that can continue for a little bit. Over the longer term, remains to be seen how long that will last, but we think that will continue.\n We also mentioned the shrink benefit, which was about 1/3 of the gain that we saw during the quarter. That's, obviously, specific to Q3 and would not repeat in Q4. Just a little color on that. The benefit was due to the significant markdowns that we took earlier this year, which reduced the value of the items that we recognized in shrink during the quarter. If you exclude the markdowns, the impact on unit shrink was relatively flat. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Just first, on inventory, just a follow-up there. Pack and hold remains fairly low relative to where it's been historically. I was wondering if you could speak to that and how you see that evolving here as you move forward.\n And then just given the current buying environment, which sounds like it's pretty favorable, just wondering if you could speak to your level of confidence in being able to generate merchandise margins as we move into the spring of next year. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the packaway levels, similar to the last quarter, we used packaway to chase ahead of plan sales as sales -- the acceleration of the quarter was well ahead of our internal plans. Overall, availability is plentiful, and we expect packaway to continue to build to historical levels. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of the current buying environment and margins, I think what we'll see is that, over time, that the margin part of it will not be quite as favorable as it is today because the buying environment in Q3 was really favorable. So we expect over time that it would more normalize. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kate Fitzsimons from RBC. \nKate Fitzsimons: I guess last quarter, you guys had called out underperformance in California, Texas, Florida and Arizona. Can you just give us an update on how some of those lagging markets were faring in the third quarter?\n And then just in terms of the negative mid-single digits quarter-to-date, is there any region that is leading the decline? That would be helpful just to frame up the regional complexion. \nMichael Hartshorn: At the time of our Q2 call in early August, we had begun to see some stabilization in those markets in our larger markets in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona. But tourist and border locations continue to significantly underperform the rest of the chain. For the quarter, California performed above the chain average, while Florida and Texas continue to be impacted by their higher concentration of border and tourist locations.\n And then on the month-to-date trend, we wouldn't get into the details of inter-quarter trends other than to say, the current trend is down mid-single digits. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious if there's anything within your supply chain that's not functioning as you would hope at this point, whether it be your ability to buy the items you want to buy or getting the product to the DCs and out to the stores. Is there anything that you're not happy with where you think there's room to improve in the fourth quarter and beyond?\n And then just bigger picture. Curious if the current situation makes you think any different about growth at dd's over the next few years, either faster or slower? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, on supply chain, if you recall, at the end of the second quarter, we had some staffing challenges, but we took a number of wage -- both wage and incentive actions in Q3 and actually feel really good about our staffing levels as we move into Q4. Throughput has improved, and we also feel good about our receipt flow to the stores.\n If there's one thing I would say about the supply chain is there has been and continues to be port congestion, like you've seen across retail. That is causing product delays in certain areas, but with our flexible business model, our overall inventory levels are positioned in line with our plans coming into the quarter. That congestion, not only in the port but across transportation modes means that we are seeing cost pressures due to the higher rates to move freight across the U.S.\n On dd's growth, I think it's too early to talk about dd's growth. We'll be in a better position to do that on our year-end conference call in March. \nPaul Lejuez: And just 1 follow-up. Any quantification of the number of new vendors that you've added this year? And where do you stand now in terms of total vendor count? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, during the course of the year, we've added hundreds of vendors, pretty broad-based across all areas. In terms of our total vendor count at this moment, I don't know if I can answer that exact number at this moment. In our annual report, we had -- I think it was 7,500. \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes, a little over -- we're a little over 8,000 now, Paul. So it's about a 5% increase that we've seen since COVID. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Great. The inventory level still looks, obviously, very, very lean. But it sounds like you're quite happy with the inventory that you've got. I'm wondering if you can help us understand what you have packed away for spring and summer that you could bring out in early 2021 to help kick off that season? Is it similar to what you would have last year? Or is it leaner? Just thinking about the first half of the year next year.\n And you talked about some port delays and some challenges that vendors have relayed to you, I think, just with moving goods. Does that, in any way, create opportunities for Ross? Or on the other hand, are you experiencing some delivery delays to your stores that could be slightly holding back sales trends? \nMichael Hartshorn: I'll answer your second question first and then turn it over to Barbara on packaway. Historically, any time there's disruptions like these, it has always created supply opportunities for off-price. And I don't think this will be any different. There's -- with the port delays, there'll be missed holiday dates, and we'd expect there to be inventory opportunities.\n For us, there could be some risk in the fourth quarter. But again, with our -- we have a lot of flexibility to move goods in and out. We have to make sure, obviously, we have the right assortments for the customer. But coming into the quarter, we feel good about our inventory levels. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of spring, Kimberly, I think it's similar to every year. It moves based on what you find in the market. And I don't think it's consistent year-to-year. I would say, overall, that it's slightly less than what we had the year before because we flowed a lot of goods into the third quarter. That's pretty much where we are today.\n And then in terms of the port and disruptions at the port, you would think disruption for us equals supply. So what goes on in the first quarter, depending upon how long the ports are jammed up, we might wind up even getting some spring supply earlier. We'll have to wait and see what happens. \nKimberly Greenberger: Great. And then just given the really materially improved financial position of the business, I'm wondering how you're thinking about the dividend and when you would expect to reevaluate potentially reinstating that dividend. \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, our near-term focus is -- continues to be preserving liquidity, especially given the current upsurge in the virus and potential impact of additional government restrictions could have on consumer demand during the holidays. So we'll wait and see how holiday pans out. But based on that, it's too early to comment on future payouts. We'd expect to have commentary in our year-end earnings conference call. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Travis, just for you on the SG&A side. Could you possibly quantify the COVID costs that you guys are incurring right now? And if there's anything -- any color you can add on what you mean when you say it should -- the cost should accelerate into Q4?\n And then just big picture on that topic. Should we consider those to be onetime, assuming if there is a vaccine and life goes back to normal by the time you start lapping these results come next year? \nTravis Marquette: Yes, sure. I think as we mentioned, cost for the third quarter, the sort of net COVID costs is how we've been talking about it, were about $25 million. So that's some pluses and then some savings and minuses that get to that number.\n In terms of the fourth quarter, again, we expect the cost to be significantly higher in Q4, really related to a couple of things within stores. We expect higher costs related to ongoing investments for personal protective equipment and other payroll and incentive actions. And then in the supply chain, again, we're forecasting higher costs due to COVID-related labor actions as well as cost to respond to industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints.\n On your question around COVID and are they onetime? Generally speaking, yes, we would expect that as the pandemic ends that these costs would start to fade out of the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Great quarter. On the real estate outlook, as you look at 2021, should we think that that's like a normal year, 90 stores per year like you were doing roughly before COVID? Or is it -- is there some catch-up next year? Or is it a slower year as you kind of restart operations? I'm just trying to think if it's an above or below normal year. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. At this point, it's too early to say what our plans are for next year, but we'll be in a position to discuss in March at our year-end conference call. \nMichael Binetti: Okay. And then, I guess, is there any consideration about the Northeast has been out there as a market that you guys haven't been in for a while. I know some of your thinking has been on the value we offer, the AURs, like, can they support the rents that are a little bit higher in that market. Is this a more attractive time for you to look at that market? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I mean, I think we're going to see opportunities across the U.S., including most -- especially in the existing markets that we're in. And also in our newer markets. So certainly, over the next couple of years that will continue to be our priority. At some point, we'll get into the Northeast. \nMichael Binetti: And then Michael, as you look at it, we've had a bunch of brands that have commented on pulling back from off-price as much as possible. I'm not sure that they stuck to their discipline on it or not. They seem to be a bit of a renewed focus. But as you look at that, and they're all -- everything going on and think about packaway versus that ones in closeout, do you think a little differently about how you want the mix of that to look going forward than in the past? Or is there anything structural that you're looking at that might be a little bit different going forward that we should think about? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, actually, let's talk about brands first. Brand strategies fluctuate from year-to-year. So different brands are doing different things as the world keeps evolving.\n In terms of packaway versus closeouts versus slowing upfront, all the mixes of it, really, we don't see a major material change. Our main thing is that what we want to deliver are really being able to deliver the best branded bargains possible to the customer. And so that comes through different buying strategies, and we don't really see that mix as of today, changing that much. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Janine Stichter from Jefferies. \nJanine Stichter: I wanted to ask a little bit about the complexion of the comp. It seems like the improvement in 3Q versus 2Q was mostly traffic driven, but I'm curious if you're seeing anything change in terms of either basket or conversion? \nTravis Marquette: Yes, sure. You're correct. The biggest change from Q2 to Q3 was on the traffic number, transaction side for us. There was not a -- yes, that was the biggest driver. \nMichael Hartshorn: So not a significant change in that. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. \nJanine Stichter: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I apologize if I missed it, but I think on the last call, you talked about overall inventory availability being very strong, but there being some gaps in the assortment in some of the hotter categories. Are you still seeing that? Or do you feel like on a category basis, the availability is where you'd like it to be? \nBarbara Rentler: I think there's some small inconsistencies now, not the way it was before. I think it's more broad-based now, but this -- in certain categories. But in every season, there are some uncertain categories, so. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. \nPaul Trussell: Good quarter. Just be looking for maybe just overall comments on the balance sheet and where we stand today, comments maybe on debt position, potential timetables and thought process around dividends and return of the buyback. And then separately, I'm just curious if you have any gauge or guess just on what percent of your core customers have returned to shop in the stores over the past few months? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. I'll start with the balance sheet. Again, we feel very good with our financial position. As I mentioned in the comments, $4.4 billion of unrestricted cash, about $5.2 billion in liquidity. So we feel very good about that.\n We talked about the debt actions that we took during the quarter. We refinanced a portion of our senior notes to significantly reduce the overall long-term cost of that. We feel good about that. I think as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call in terms of go-forward and dividends and buybacks and whatnot, again, our current focus remains on preservation of cash and liquidity. There's just a tremendous amount of uncertainty regarding the virus and how that will progress. \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, on the consumer, we, obviously, speak to our customers often through survey work. I would say at this point we don't have a comprehensive information to share at this time, but we know that she continues to prioritize value when deciding where to shop. And given, as I mentioned earlier, the large number of retail closures, that means she has fewer places to shop now, and that's benefited us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: It looks like once we're in a post-vaccine environment, many of these COVID costs will fall off. But is there any reason why some of the gains you've seen in merchandise margins would necessarily fall off? I guess what I'm asking is, could margins over the long term exceed your prior peaks coming out of this? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, part of -- Lorraine, I think a big piece of the margin that we're seeing in the off-price sector right now is the -- with the availability of goods and the chase back into Q3. I think over time as supply levels and vendors are more proactive, I think, in managing through different sectors of inventory in stores, I think the supply will become more normalized. And I think with that, the margins will become -- I'm not saying they couldn't be better than they were historically, but I think versus where they stand today, I just don't see that holding. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congrats and best of luck with the holiday, in case I forgot to add that at the end. Travis, I just wanted to clarify one thing you said about shrink. I think you said that the value was down, but that was due to the fact that what, I guess, went missing was already marked down. So if you can clarify that?\n And then, Barbara, I'm just curious at a high level, are you seeing sales also very strong? I think you called out home, but other -- what people are calling COVID categories like kids, beauty and active? \nTravis Marquette: Yes, sure. On shrink, you have it about right. So because of the significant markdowns that we took earlier in the year, that reduced the retail value of the items that we recorded the shrink during the quarter, which gave us a benefit. As I mentioned, if you look at it on a sort of unit basis compared to last year, it was relatively similar. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the classifications, Marni, those other classifications are strong also. Beauty continues to be strong, kids is strong as well as home. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: Great. My question is about in-store inventory levels. How did you feel about the in-store inventory levels in the quarter? Did you feel like there was enough inventory in the store to capture all the demand? Or could have been opportunities to do even more sales had there been even more inventory in the store? \nMichael Hartshorn: On inventory, as you know, historically, we've managed our in-store inventory levels very conservatively, and that's not going to change going forward. I'd say we got inventory levels to where we wanted them during the quarter. We're, obviously, trying to manage the business very conservatively. I'm sure there's pockets of inventory or areas of the store where if we had more, we could have turned faster. But overall, we were pleased with the inventory levels. \nBarbara Rentler: I think the way we should think about it is -- the way we think about it is because we chase the sales to above plan, we drove a lot of fresh receipts into the store. So the customer could come every week and see something new and something different. And so every business might not have been positioned exactly the way -- I'm not even sure the way I'd say we'd want it to because I think the off-price customers are used to coming into a store and seeing variances in inventory levels and products. But I think the thing that helped to drive the quarter sales was really the fresh receipts and the fact that she could come in every week into the treasure hunt and find something different. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Sorry if I missed it, how was AUR this quarter? And then, Barbara, do you have a view on the industry-wide promotional cadence for holiday? And how you see your AUR opportunity for holiday and into next year? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Sure. AUR was down. It was down during the quarter. \nSimeon Siegel: Any thoughts on just -- yes, I'm sorry. \nBarbara Rentler: Go ahead. Go ahead. \nSimeon Siegel: No, no. I was just going to ask about the holiday, just how you're viewing the broad promotion. \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Well, we think it's going to be a very promotional holiday season. I mean, it's been promotional for a number of years, and I don't expect this year to be any different. I think the most important thing for us to do is to be able to deliver really compelling bargains to the customer. And if we do that, we'll do fine.\n In terms of the AUR, the AUR moved a lot with the deals that you get based on the values you put on the floor, and we are highly focused on value because that's what the customer is focused on. And also, the AUR also can move around within the total box based on the businesses that you're driving. So in terms of as we go forward, we are going to buy and to drive into the businesses that the customer is responding to, and the AUR will move with that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: When you were contemplating your inventory plan for this holiday period, how are you thinking about the potential for store closures, capacity limitations? And how quickly can you adjust, assuming there are adjustments needed given the congestion? Do you think that you run the risk of missing out on sales because inventories are just too light? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I mean, the way we approach the holiday season is very cautiously. Especially with the recent upsurge and restrictions, we're going to balance sales with managing the business, managing our liquidity and managing inventory. So there is a chance that we could miss some sales, but we're going to take a very cautious approach and make sure we're positioned well to react to what's in front of us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Just a couple of quick questions. On the home category, can you maybe -- I think you called it out as strong. I'm just wondering if you can maybe give us a little more color in terms of really what you're seeing in home and maybe even inventory availability around the home.\n And also separately, just wage rates. I think you talked about higher wages and some of the staffing levels throughout the supply chain. Just generally, in terms of what you're seeing overall throughout the staff would be very helpful in the stores. \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of the home business, the business is healthy across all classifications. I think as the customer is home and they're not going to work and they're working from home, I think every classification is good. I mean, maybe with the exception of probably the weakest business would be travel as it would make sense because people aren't really traveling, but it's very broad-based. \n In terms of availability, part of the home business is a direct import business. So some lead times have gotten longer in some of those businesses for future. And then for shorter term, we did -- the merchants did a very good job of getting closeouts, some closeouts in the third quarter which we were pleased with. But that business is really much more of an upfront business and it's laid further out. \nMichael Hartshorn: On wages, where we're seeing the most market pressure, as I mentioned, is in our distribution centers and supply chain. And as I mentioned, we did make base wage increases. We also have COVID incentive for the DC associates. And in stores, both stores and DCs, we're very happy with our staffing levels and have been able to staff up for holiday in both areas. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs. \nAlexandra Walvis: I had a question also on categories. You mentioned outperformance of home and active and underperformance elsewhere. As you move through the quarter and you saw the improvement in the comp, did that improvement come from incremental strength in the strong categories or a little bit of recovery in some of those weaker categories?\n And then second question is any thoughts on freight costs as you head into next year? \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of the comp and the trending businesses, as the quarter went on, those businesses got stronger as we chased after them more aggressively when we saw the customers' trend. And so those businesses, obviously, best -- home was our best-performing business. So those businesses help to drive the comp forward. \nMichael Hartshorn: On transportation and freight charges, obviously, the significant -- both import and domestic congestion is driving up freight costs now. We're paying surcharges to make sure we can get freight through the supply chain and onto the stores. Our expectation would be that that would continue likely through the first quarter because that's the expectation for congestion. We'll have more to say on the full year impact in our year-end conference call. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. \nJamie Merriman: Can you just update us on where home is now as a percentage of the mix? And whether you see any limit on that as a category? Could it get to 40% of sales at some point? Or would you view that as too big?\n And then in terms of store planning, I appreciate it's too early to say what your plan is for 2021. But can you remind us how you've thought historically about what your sort of capacity constraint is around opening new stores faster? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of home, the home business escalates in the fourth quarter and gets much closer to 30% mark, 31% mark. It's traditionally around 25%, 26% for us. It comes up. As we go forward, our expectation is that business will continue to grow at a faster rate than the rest of the company because that's what the customer is after. And also, there is a lot of businesses in home that you can drive. \nMichael Hartshorn: Could you repeat your question on the store growth? \nJamie Merriman: Sure. So historically, when you've talked about how you think about the pace of store openings, I think you've talked about wanting to have management attention around number of stores that you're opening. Can you just remind us what the sort of capacity constraints are as a business in terms of ability to accelerate store openings to the extent that there are more opportunities in 2021 or 2022? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I would -- for us, our historical level of store openings is around 100 per year. Typically, 80% Ross, 20% dd's. That's a level that we're comfortable with. We like our ability to execute at that level, both in getting the right site and also open the stores successfully from a store operations standpoint. So I'd say that's a level that we're comfortable with. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Wanted to get some color on how you're thinking about occupancy costs and the ability given lease renegotiations to leverage those costs. Is that an SG&A tailwind for you going into 2021? And are you at all thinking about any adjustments in store size or the structure of the store in 2021 and beyond for Ross or dd's? And how you're seeing the real estate landscape? \nTravis Marquette: Sure, Dana. I think it's too early to predict what's going to happen in the -- in terms of occupancy costs. Just the occupancy for us is in cost of goods sold not in the SG&A line. But I think it's too early to predict what's going to happen. Obviously, with the store closures, there's going to be -- we think there's going to be plenty of opportunities. So I think it's too early to call at this point. \nDana Telsey: Got it. And just when you're thinking about the buying for next year and planning for Easter or the other holidays going forward, how do you see the overall change in inventory levels compared to what you have now? Are you seeing differences in vendor assortments? Are you seeing differences in terms of what you'll be able to get your hands on for goods in the first half of 2021? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So buying for Easter -- obviously, Q1 is normally a tough quarter. And with the unknown of what will happen with the virus and the pandemic, I would envision us having a very conservative plan in Q1, particularly inventory since we don't know really how things will be playing out. Buying for Easter, I think that Easter -- if people really can't go out and celebrate holidays still at that point, I think Easter will not be quite as big as it normally historically has been. So that whole first quarter period, I think, is just a conservative period that we'll have to see how big we want that to be.\n In terms of vendor assortments, yes, look, we have a very large merchant team. We have really very strong relationships in the market. We've tried to be very good partners during this period of time. And I see the assortment for 2021 being pretty balanced in terms of a good, better, best and the brands that we want. There'll always be -- in a vendor assortment, there'll always be certain things you don't have. There'll always be certain times you don't have it and all of that, but I don't see any major shift in the brands and the values that we can offer the customer. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great recovery on the business. A quick one for me. Just you spoke that longer hours of operation as one of the drivers of the sales recovery as the quarter progressed. Curious if you're back to normal hours at this point in time? Or if that's still a potential tailwind to come? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. Yes, during the third quarter, we returned to normal operating hours. Going into the holiday season, we historically have extended them further, and we plan to do the same this holiday season. We're allowed to do so. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners. \nRoxanne Meyer: Congrats on the improvement you saw. Kind of building off of that, I wanted to see how good do you feel about your ability to process traffic you do get, assuming the pandemic doesn't disrupt that? I imagine that you're putting incremental safeguards in your stores, logistics to move people through the store. But how should we think about the overall capacity in that you're able to get -- process people through that want to get in your store? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. It's a good question, Roxanne. I'd say store capacity limits are changing on a daily basis. It's very dynamic based on local restrictions. A 25% occupancy is pretty common, but we feel good about the changes we made. We're certainly going to invest in front-end cash hearing to make sure we move people through the lines, but there is peak days and peak hours during the days where we expect to have lines, and we'll do our best to move people through. That's mainly in high-volume stores and again, on peak days. But we feel good about the strategies we put in place during the holidays. \nOperator: I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish all of you and your families a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter and year-to-date performance. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n The vast majority of our stores were operating throughout the third quarter. That said, given the worsening pandemic, we will remain vigilant in monitoring local developments to assess any potential changes that might be necessary to our operations based on local state or other government directives. We will continue to make the health and well-being of our associates and customers a top priority.\n Turning now to our financial results. Total sales for the third quarter declined 2% to $3.8 billion with comparable store sales down 3%. Sales improved substantially compared to the second quarter following a slower start in August. This acceleration was driven by several factors, including an improvement in our merchandise assortments, a later back-to-school season, stronger performance in our larger markets and our return to more normal store hours.\n In October, the company refinanced $775 million in senior notes to significantly reduce the annual interest expense and total cash outlays over the life of the debt. This action resulted in a onetime charge of $240 million or $0.65 per share impact to net earnings in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Including this impact, for the 13 weeks ended October 31, 2020, net income was $131 million or $0.37 per share compared to $371 million or $1.03 per share for the same period last year. Year-to-date, the loss per share was $0.43 on a net loss of $153 million, also including the aforementioned onetime charge. This compares to net income of $1.2 billion or $3.32 per share for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first 9 months of 2020 were $8.3 billion versus $11.6 billion last year.\n Third quarter operating margin of 4.4% was down from 12.4% last year and was negatively impacted by the onetime debt refinancing charge, which was equivalent to 640 basis points. In addition, the year-over-year margin decline reflects higher COVID-related operating costs in 2020 and the deleveraging effect on expenses throughout the business from the decline in same-store sales. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 25% from the prior year with average store inventories down 8%.\n During the period, we continued to make progress on our distribution capabilities to support peak sales during the holiday selling season. Packaway levels at quarter end were 26% of the total compared to last year's 39%. For the third quarter, the strongest merchandise areas at Ross was home, while the Midwest and the Southeast were the best-performing geographic regions. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS performance accelerated during the quarter as their value offering also resonated well with customers. Overall, our improved core business results demonstrates consumers' continued focus on value and our ongoing ability to deliver the bargains our customers come to expect from us.\n Turning to store growth. As expected, we opened 30 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the third quarter, completing our expansion program for 2020. After the planned closing of about 10 existing stores in the fourth quarter, we anticipate ending the year with 1,585 Ross and 274 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 54 for fiscal 2020.\n Now Travis will provide further color on third quarter results. Thank you, Travis. As we look ahead to the holiday season, we expect a highly competitive retail environment in a difficult economic and political atmosphere, both of which are complicated by our lack of visibility surrounding the worsening pandemic. Despite these near-term challenges, I want to emphasize that we have a talented and seasoned management team that we believe will enable us to effectively navigate through any short-term headwinds.\n Over the longer term, we remain well positioned in the off-price sector to gain market share, as we believe consumers will continue to favor retailers' focus on delivering value and convenience, both of which we have and will continue to provide to our customers.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. Sure. First, in terms of our inventory assortments, I think as the quarter went on, the merchants did a fine job of actually chasing the goods in the market and shifting the assortments into the classifications that the customer is desiring, which is more home and things that are casual activewear.\n In terms of availability in the market, we're seeing availability pretty broad-based in most classifications, and there's plenty of supply, so we're not as worried about the supply.\n And in terms of stability of the model for off-price, as we go forward, look, I think when we get to the other side post pandemic, there's a customer who really likes shopping in stores, who enjoys the off-price model because there's a treasure hunt and the excitement, and I'll call it the fun, and also for retail stores that really focus on value and convenience, and that's really all those metrics to what the Ross model does. And then in terms of the current buying environment and margins, I think what we'll see is that, over time, that the margin part of it will not be quite as favorable as it is today because the buying environment in Q3 was really favorable. So we expect over time that it would more normalize. Well, during the course of the year, we've added hundreds of vendors, pretty broad-based across all areas. In terms of our total vendor count at this moment, I don't know if I can answer that exact number at this moment. In our annual report, we had -- I think it was 7,500. And in terms of spring, Kimberly, I think it's similar to every year. It moves based on what you find in the market. And I don't think it's consistent year-to-year. I would say, overall, that it's slightly less than what we had the year before because we flowed a lot of goods into the third quarter. That's pretty much where we are today.\n And then in terms of the port and disruptions at the port, you would think disruption for us equals supply. So what goes on in the first quarter, depending upon how long the ports are jammed up, we might wind up even getting some spring supply earlier. We'll have to wait and see what happens. Well, actually, let's talk about brands first. Brand strategies fluctuate from year-to-year. So different brands are doing different things as the world keeps evolving.\n In terms of packaway versus closeouts versus slowing upfront, all the mixes of it, really, we don't see a major material change. Our main thing is that what we want to deliver are really being able to deliver the best branded bargains possible to the customer. And so that comes through different buying strategies, and we don't really see that mix as of today, changing that much. I think there's some small inconsistencies now, not the way it was before. I think it's more broad-based now, but this -- in certain categories. But in every season, there are some uncertain categories, so. Well, part of -- Lorraine, I think a big piece of the margin that we're seeing in the off-price sector right now is the -- with the availability of goods and the chase back into Q3. I think over time as supply levels and vendors are more proactive, I think, in managing through different sectors of inventory in stores, I think the supply will become more normalized. And I think with that, the margins will become -- I'm not saying they couldn't be better than they were historically, but I think versus where they stand today, I just don't see that holding. And in terms of the classifications, Marni, those other classifications are strong also. Beauty continues to be strong, kids is strong as well as home. I think the way we should think about it is -- the way we think about it is because we chase the sales to above plan, we drove a lot of fresh receipts into the store. So the customer could come every week and see something new and something different. And so every business might not have been positioned exactly the way -- I'm not even sure the way I'd say we'd want it to because I think the off-price customers are used to coming into a store and seeing variances in inventory levels and products. But I think the thing that helped to drive the quarter sales was really the fresh receipts and the fact that she could come in every week into the treasure hunt and find something different. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yes. Well, we think it's going to be a very promotional holiday season. I mean, it's been promotional for a number of years, and I don't expect this year to be any different. I think the most important thing for us to do is to be able to deliver really compelling bargains to the customer. And if we do that, we'll do fine.\n In terms of the AUR, the AUR moved a lot with the deals that you get based on the values you put on the floor, and we are highly focused on value because that's what the customer is focused on. And also, the AUR also can move around within the total box based on the businesses that you're driving. So in terms of as we go forward, we are going to buy and to drive into the businesses that the customer is responding to, and the AUR will move with that. In terms of the home business, the business is healthy across all classifications. I think as the customer is home and they're not going to work and they're working from home, I think every classification is good. I mean, maybe with the exception of probably the weakest business would be travel as it would make sense because people aren't really traveling, but it's very broad-based. \n In terms of availability, part of the home business is a direct import business. So some lead times have gotten longer in some of those businesses for future. And then for shorter term, we did -- the merchants did a very good job of getting closeouts, some closeouts in the third quarter which we were pleased with. But that business is really much more of an upfront business and it's laid further out. In terms of the comp and the trending businesses, as the quarter went on, those businesses got stronger as we chased after them more aggressively when we saw the customers' trend. And so those businesses, obviously, best -- home was our best-performing business. So those businesses help to drive the comp forward. Sure. In terms of home, the home business escalates in the fourth quarter and gets much closer to 30% mark, 31% mark. It's traditionally around 25%, 26% for us. It comes up. As we go forward, our expectation is that business will continue to grow at a faster rate than the rest of the company because that's what the customer is after. And also, there is a lot of businesses in home that you can drive. Sure. So buying for Easter -- obviously, Q1 is normally a tough quarter. And with the unknown of what will happen with the virus and the pandemic, I would envision us having a very conservative plan in Q1, particularly inventory since we don't know really how things will be playing out. Buying for Easter, I think that Easter -- if people really can't go out and celebrate holidays still at that point, I think Easter will not be quite as big as it normally historically has been. So that whole first quarter period, I think, is just a conservative period that we'll have to see how big we want that to be.\n In terms of vendor assortments, yes, look, we have a very large merchant team. We have really very strong relationships in the market. We've tried to be very good partners during this period of time. And I see the assortment for 2021 being pretty balanced in terms of a good, better, best and the brands that we want. There'll always be -- in a vendor assortment, there'll always be certain things you don't have. There'll always be certain times you don't have it and all of that, but I don't see any major shift in the brands and the values that we can offer the customer. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish all of you and your families a happy, healthy and safe holiday season."

            "content": "Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. I'll also add with the extraordinary large number of current and future retail closures, it does mean that she has fewer places to shop, and we think that off-price in general and Ross and dd's specifically are well positioned to gain market share post pandemic. On the packaway levels, similar to the last quarter, we used packaway to chase ahead of plan sales as sales -- the acceleration of the quarter was well ahead of our internal plans. Overall, availability is plentiful, and we expect packaway to continue to build to historical levels. At the time of our Q2 call in early August, we had begun to see some stabilization in those markets in our larger markets in California, Florida, Texas and Arizona. But tourist and border locations continue to significantly underperform the rest of the chain. For the quarter, California performed above the chain average, while Florida and Texas continue to be impacted by their higher concentration of border and tourist locations.\n And then on the month-to-date trend, we wouldn't get into the details of inter-quarter trends other than to say, the current trend is down mid-single digits. Well, on supply chain, if you recall, at the end of the second quarter, we had some staffing challenges, but we took a number of wage -- both wage and incentive actions in Q3 and actually feel really good about our staffing levels as we move into Q4. Throughput has improved, and we also feel good about our receipt flow to the stores.\n If there's one thing I would say about the supply chain is there has been and continues to be port congestion, like you've seen across retail. That is causing product delays in certain areas, but with our flexible business model, our overall inventory levels are positioned in line with our plans coming into the quarter. That congestion, not only in the port but across transportation modes means that we are seeing cost pressures due to the higher rates to move freight across the U.S.\n On dd's growth, I think it's too early to talk about dd's growth. We'll be in a better position to do that on our year-end conference call in March. Yes, a little over -- we're a little over 8,000 now, Paul. So it's about a 5% increase that we've seen since COVID. I'll answer your second question first and then turn it over to Barbara on packaway. Historically, any time there's disruptions like these, it has always created supply opportunities for off-price. And I don't think this will be any different. There's -- with the port delays, there'll be missed holiday dates, and we'd expect there to be inventory opportunities.\n For us, there could be some risk in the fourth quarter. But again, with our -- we have a lot of flexibility to move goods in and out. We have to make sure, obviously, we have the right assortments for the customer. But coming into the quarter, we feel good about our inventory levels. Kimberly, our near-term focus is -- continues to be preserving liquidity, especially given the current upsurge in the virus and potential impact of additional government restrictions could have on consumer demand during the holidays. So we'll wait and see how holiday pans out. But based on that, it's too early to comment on future payouts. We'd expect to have commentary in our year-end earnings conference call. Sure. At this point, it's too early to say what our plans are for next year, but we'll be in a position to discuss in March at our year-end conference call. Yes. I mean, I think we're going to see opportunities across the U.S., including most -- especially in the existing markets that we're in. And also in our newer markets. So certainly, over the next couple of years that will continue to be our priority. At some point, we'll get into the Northeast. So not a significant change in that. Paul, on the consumer, we, obviously, speak to our customers often through survey work. I would say at this point we don't have a comprehensive information to share at this time, but we know that she continues to prioritize value when deciding where to shop. And given, as I mentioned earlier, the large number of retail closures, that means she has fewer places to shop now, and that's benefited us. On inventory, as you know, historically, we've managed our in-store inventory levels very conservatively, and that's not going to change going forward. I'd say we got inventory levels to where we wanted them during the quarter. We're, obviously, trying to manage the business very conservatively. I'm sure there's pockets of inventory or areas of the store where if we had more, we could have turned faster. But overall, we were pleased with the inventory levels. Yes. I mean, the way we approach the holiday season is very cautiously. Especially with the recent upsurge and restrictions, we're going to balance sales with managing the business, managing our liquidity and managing inventory. So there is a chance that we could miss some sales, but we're going to take a very cautious approach and make sure we're positioned well to react to what's in front of us. On wages, where we're seeing the most market pressure, as I mentioned, is in our distribution centers and supply chain. And as I mentioned, we did make base wage increases. We also have COVID incentive for the DC associates. And in stores, both stores and DCs, we're very happy with our staffing levels and have been able to staff up for holiday in both areas. On transportation and freight charges, obviously, the significant -- both import and domestic congestion is driving up freight costs now. We're paying surcharges to make sure we can get freight through the supply chain and onto the stores. Our expectation would be that that would continue likely through the first quarter because that's the expectation for congestion. We'll have more to say on the full year impact in our year-end conference call. Could you repeat your question on the store growth? Yes. I would -- for us, our historical level of store openings is around 100 per year. Typically, 80% Ross, 20% dd's. That's a level that we're comfortable with. We like our ability to execute at that level, both in getting the right site and also open the stores successfully from a store operations standpoint. So I'd say that's a level that we're comfortable with. Sure. Yes, during the third quarter, we returned to normal operating hours. Going into the holiday season, we historically have extended them further, and we plan to do the same this holiday season. We're allowed to do so. Yes. It's a good question, Roxanne. I'd say store capacity limits are changing on a daily basis. It's very dynamic based on local restrictions. A 25% occupancy is pretty common, but we feel good about the changes we made. We're certainly going to invest in front-end cash hearing to make sure we move people through the lines, but there is peak days and peak hours during the days where we expect to have lines, and we'll do our best to move people through. That's mainly in high-volume stores and again, on peak days. But we feel good about the strategies we put in place during the holidays."

            "name": "Travis Marquette",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara noted, comparable store sales decreased 3% versus last year. This decline was driven by a lower number of transactions that was partially offset by a larger average basket size.\n Again, as mentioned earlier, operating margin for the quarter was 4.4%, down from 12.4% last year. Cost of goods sold increased 35 basis points in the period. Merchandise margin grew by 190 basis points, driven by a favorable buying environment and lower inventory shortage. These items were more than offset by freight costs that rose 90 basis points and higher distribution expenses of 70 basis points. In addition, buying and occupancy delevered by 40 and 25 basis points, respectively.\n Selling and general and administrative expenses increased 765 basis points, which includes the previously mentioned 640 basis point impact from the onetime debt refinancing charge in addition to the deleveraging effect from the decline in same-store sales and higher COVID-related operating costs in 2020. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately $25 million with a slightly higher impact to cost of goods sold than SG&A. We expect net COVID-related costs to be significantly higher in Q4 relative to Q3. These increases primarily relate to managing impact from industry-wide capacity constraints and congestion as well as wage and incentive actions in our supply chain and stores.\n Turning to our balance sheet. In addition to the refinancing of a portion of our senior notes during the third quarter, we also took several actions to reduce our ongoing debt costs, including the repayment of the $800 million revolving credit facility and terminating the undrawn $500 million revolver. Overall, we remain in a strong financial position, ending the quarter with over $5.2 billion in liquidity, which includes an unrestricted cash balance of about $4.4 billion and the $800 million revolver that remains available.\n As mentioned in our press release, entering the fourth quarter, our month-to-date comparable store sales in November are down mid-single digits. In addition, there remains a high level of uncertainty related to the worsening health crisis, and we are concerned with how the upsurge of this pandemic might impact consumer demand during what we expect to be a highly competitive holiday shopping season. Given the lack of visibility we have concerning these external risks and how they may evolve and impact our business, we will continue to manage our operations conservatively and will not be providing specific details or earnings per share guidance for the fourth quarter.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Sure. This is Travis. We're not providing specific guidance for the fourth quarter, but a couple of comments on merchandise margins. We mentioned merch margin was up 190 basis points, driven by the favorable buying environment. We think there's -- that can continue for a little bit. Over the longer term, remains to be seen how long that will last, but we think that will continue.\n We also mentioned the shrink benefit, which was about 1/3 of the gain that we saw during the quarter. That's, obviously, specific to Q3 and would not repeat in Q4. Just a little color on that. The benefit was due to the significant markdowns that we took earlier this year, which reduced the value of the items that we recognized in shrink during the quarter. If you exclude the markdowns, the impact on unit shrink was relatively flat. Yes, sure. I think as we mentioned, cost for the third quarter, the sort of net COVID costs is how we've been talking about it, were about $25 million. So that's some pluses and then some savings and minuses that get to that number.\n In terms of the fourth quarter, again, we expect the cost to be significantly higher in Q4, really related to a couple of things within stores. We expect higher costs related to ongoing investments for personal protective equipment and other payroll and incentive actions. And then in the supply chain, again, we're forecasting higher costs due to COVID-related labor actions as well as cost to respond to industry-wide supply chain capacity constraints.\n On your question around COVID and are they onetime? Generally speaking, yes, we would expect that as the pandemic ends that these costs would start to fade out of the business. Yes, sure. You're correct. The biggest change from Q2 to Q3 was on the traffic number, transaction side for us. There was not a -- yes, that was the biggest driver. Yes. Yes. I'll start with the balance sheet. Again, we feel very good with our financial position. As I mentioned in the comments, $4.4 billion of unrestricted cash, about $5.2 billion in liquidity. So we feel very good about that.\n We talked about the debt actions that we took during the quarter. We refinanced a portion of our senior notes to significantly reduce the overall long-term cost of that. We feel good about that. I think as we talked about a little bit earlier on the call in terms of go-forward and dividends and buybacks and whatnot, again, our current focus remains on preservation of cash and liquidity. There's just a tremendous amount of uncertainty regarding the virus and how that will progress. Yes, sure. On shrink, you have it about right. So because of the significant markdowns that we took earlier in the year, that reduced the retail value of the items that we recorded the shrink during the quarter, which gave us a benefit. As I mentioned, if you look at it on a sort of unit basis compared to last year, it was relatively similar. Yes. Sure. AUR was down. It was down during the quarter. Sure, Dana. I think it's too early to predict what's going to happen in the -- in terms of occupancy costs. Just the occupancy for us is in cost of goods sold not in the SG&A line. But I think it's too early to predict what's going to happen. Obviously, with the store closures, there's going to be -- we think there's going to be plenty of opportunities. So I think it's too early to call at this point."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call may contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future operations and financial results, store openings and reopenings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements and from historical performance or current expectations. Additional information about related risk factors is included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2019 Form 10-K and fiscal 2020 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with an update on the status of the company's operations, including some color on our store reopenings, followed by a review of our second quarter performance. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As a reminder, all store and distribution center locations were closed from March 20 through May 14, when we began a phased process of resuming operations. On average, our stores were open for about 75% of the quarter, though operating on shorter hours compared to the prior year. All our distribution centers were reopened by the end of May.\n The ongoing COVID-19 health crisis remains very fluid, and we continue to closely monitor local developments to assess any potential changes to our operations as mandated by local, state or other government directives. We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and customers as we navigate through this pandemic.\n Turning now to our financials. Total sales for the second quarter were $2.7 billion compared to $4 billion in the prior year, reflecting the negative impact from store closures during the period. Comparable store sales were down 12% for reopened stores from the date of the reopening to the end of the fiscal quarter. Sales during the quarter were significantly impacted by several factors including COVID-19's negative effect on consumer demand, particularly in California, Florida, and Arizona, which represents about 50% of our store base.\n Further, during the initial reopenings, overall sales were ahead of our conservative plans as we benefited from pent-up demand and aggressive markdowns to clear aged inventory. In the weeks thereafter, trends were negatively impacted from depleted store inventory levels, while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities. For the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2020, earnings per share were $0.06 on net income of $22 million. This compares to net income of $413 million or earnings per share of $1.14 for the same period last year. Year-to-date, the loss per share was $0.81 versus earnings per share of $2.29 last year.\n Our net loss of $284 million is compared to net income of $834 million in the first half of 2019. Sales for the first 6 months of 2020 declined 42% to $4.5 billion. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 39% from the prior year, with average store inventories down 10% versus the same period last year.\n Packaway levels at quarter end were 25% of the total compared to last year's 43% as we use packaway to replenish store inventory throughout the quarter. As planned, we did not open any new stores in the second quarter. We continue to expect to add about 39 locations this fall for a total of 66 new stores for the full year.\n Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter results. \nTravis Marquette: Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara noted, stores operated on average for 75% of the period with comparable store sales down 12% versus last year from the date of their reopenings to the end of the fiscal quarter. The decline was driven by a lower number of transactions that was partially offset by a larger average basket size. Average unit retail was down during the period, reflecting the strong sell-through of deeply discounted aged inventory.\n Operating margin for the quarter was 3.2% compared to 13.7% last year. Both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the deleveraging effect from lower sales versus last year and expenditures for COVID-19-related measures. In addition, cost of goods sold was impacted by the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses. These higher costs were somewhat offset by the partial reversal of the inventory valuation reserve we took in the first quarter resulting from the faster-than-expected sell-through of aged inventory. This reversal benefited the second quarter by $174 million or $0.19 per share.\n Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter in cost of goods sold and SG&A combined were approximately $65 million, primarily for costs associated with restarting the business, supplies, cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols.\n We ended the quarter in a healthy financial position with over $4.3 billion in liquidity, which includes an ending unrestricted cash balance of about $3.8 billion and an undrawn $500 million revolver.\n As we move into the third quarter, trends have not materially changed from the second quarter, with comparable store sales for the first 2.5 weeks trending down mid-teens versus last year. Given the lack of visibility on the potential impact from this ongoing health crisis, we are not providing sales or earnings guidance.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Travis. Aside from the pandemic impact on consumer demand, as initial reopening sales significantly exceeded our conservative forecast, we were unable to ramp up our buying and distribution capabilities quickly enough to adequately replenish stores. As Travis mentioned earlier, the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis remains extremely uncertain, and we have limited insight into how this pandemic could further impact consumer demand and the retail and economic landscape. There is additional risk if COVID-19 cases remain elevated or increased, potentially prompting larger scale shutdowns of our operations. Given these uncertainties, we believe the most prudent approach is to plan and manage the business very cautiously, while continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and associates.\n As we move forward during this challenging period, we remain confident that our strong financial foundation and outstanding team of experienced off-price executives will help see us through these uncertain times.\n Over the longer term, we remain well positioned as an off-price retailer to continue to gain market share given the large number of retail store closures and consumers' continued focus on value and convenience. We've proven in the past that we have successfully competed in this type of retail environment and believe we will do so again.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. Barbara, on the cadence of customer traffic that you've seen since reopening, how much of the recent moderation do you attribute to health concerns versus the lighter inventory that you cited? And larger picture, do you believe anything in the competitive landscape has changed as we think about market share beyond the pandemic? \nMichael Hartshorn: Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the recent trends, I think there's a number of factors that are impacting what we're seeing currently. I certainly think there are things internally that we can focus on in terms of execution. We're still not where we want to be on ramping up the DCs and continue to have lower receipts than planned. I do think there are external factors that include things like the expiration of unemployment that happened at the end of July, obviously, with no back-to-school as the country has moved to distance learning. I think those are the primary factors.\n And looking on long-term growth, obviously, the pre-COVID trend had customers migrating to value and convenience. And this disruption just accelerated those trends with a number of store closures, our value proposition and 1,800 and growing conveniently located store locations, I think we have a significant opportunity to gain market share over the longer term. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then just a follow-up on gross margin. How best to think about the puts and takes on merchandise margins in the back half of the year? Any help would be really greatly appreciated. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Sure, Matthew. This is Travis. In terms of the margin components for this quarter, similar to last quarter, given the significant deleveraging effect of having our stores closed for a portion of the quarter, we're not providing specific margin components. The puts and takes this quarter, I covered in my remarks. And then in terms of the go-forward look, again, given the ongoing uncertainty, we're not providing any forward guidance or commentary on future margins right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I was hoping you could touch on some of the current inventory dynamics. What does availability look like in the marketplace, just both in general and in some of the stronger trending categories? And how do you feel about your ability to really chase back into some of these key categories should the demand backdrop recover faster than you're seeing right now? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Overall, we continue to see a lot of supply out there, but it's not as consistent across the merchandise areas. We believe that these creates opportunities in some products in some areas and gaps in other areas. In terms of stronger trendier categories, that's kind of a broad question. But I would say in most businesses, there has been supply in that -- without having what that trendy category is, kind of hard to comment on it. But what I would say is that in key categories, the merchants are out there chasing every day, and we have very conservative plans that they're working towards. And I think over time, in the categories that have, I'll say, gaps in the assortment today, I think eventually, that will catch up. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Just following up on that question, when do you think you'll be appropriately stocked? And then as you look at your packaway volumes, do you feel comfortable with the mix and content of that inventory that it's appropriate for the current environment? \nMichael Hartshorn: Lorraine, on the stocking, I'm going to go through the sequence of the quarter, and that will help explain the actions that we're taking to get inventory levels that are appropriate for the plan. When we first began our phased opening of stores, that's the first thing we did, and then we opened our DCs. And we did it in that order because of government restrictions in California and actually Pennsylvania at that point in time. Because sales exceeded our conservative expectations when we reopened, at the same time, we were ramping and initially opening and initially ramping our DCs, the result was the depleted store inventory. The initial ramp-up of our distribution centers took longer than we had hoped. And we've had further difficulty ramping up our DCs to full capacity due to staffing challenges.\n We've taken aggressive steps to improve our production levels that include higher wages and incentives. And believe those actions will allow us to quickly -- more quickly ramp up to peak capacity over the next few months. So I think we would expect to see improvement as we progress through the quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the content of packaway, I mean, we're pleased with the content the pathway we have now. We don't feel like we have any residual issues or anything from spring. As to Michael's point, we used packaway to drive our business in Q2 and got through everything. So of the levels that we own, we feel fine about the content. And in terms of just packaway in general, the merchants, as you know, packaway fluctuates normally. And the merchants are out there chasing packaway now looking for spring product, current product, whatever the great deals are, because the most important thing about packaway is that what you own is really great content. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Great. Barbara, I was very interested in what you said about the state that are seeing particular impacts from COVID, California, Arizona, Texas and Florida. You talked about in the second quarter that your store openings were in that -- the store opening days, you were comping down 12%. Did you see a worse result in those 4 markets than the company average at minus 12%? And then I just wanted to reflect on what's happening currently here in August. And I wonder if there's any way for you to figure out if the current month-to-date mid-teens decline in sales trends is indicative of underlying consumer demand right now? Or are you seeing headwinds from either insufficient inventory levels that might be impacting your sales here in August, given that you're still ramping? Or another potential explanation could be that with this abnormal back-to-school that you referenced, maybe the kids business, juniors, young men's are underperforming, and other categories are doing better, and it's just a function of slow demand there. I'm just trying to break apart the pieces to understand a little bit more of the underlying drivers of the business, if you can provide any insight there? \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, it's Michael. On the regional trends, Texas, Florida, California and Arizona underperformed the rest of the chain by significant margins. Now part of that is driven by the resurgence in those areas during the quarter. So they had a significant impact on the overall performance. Trends in certain areas have improved as the cases improved. And then on the current trend, we do believe that part of the current trend is driven by lower-than-planned receipts with the DCs continuing to ramp up. So we do think that, that is a factor in the current trend. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. And then as it pertains to the assortment and back-to-school, we plan those businesses very conservatively. We made the adjustments in the assortments that we thought were appropriate based on what was going on in the outside world with children going back-to-school or not. And obviously, we're still in back-to-school. So it's kind of hard to rate the total experience. But we went in with pretty conservative plans for back-to-school. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great, Barbara. And Michael, I just wanted to ask, to the extent that you think inventory levels or depressed inventory levels could be hurting current sales trends, is there a way for us to think about when over the next 1 or maybe 2 months, you would expect to be in a more -- in a better in-store inventory position that would be maybe reflective of where you'd like to have seen them today? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Kimberly. I think I would repeat my comment with Lorraine. We've taken aggressive actions in the DCs. We probably took them later than we should, but we do expect to -- we do expect those actions to improve our throughput and bring the levels up to peak capacity over the next couple months. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. \nJanine Stichter: I wanted to ask a little bit about the complexion of the comp. I think you mentioned higher average basket and lower AUR. The average basket makes sense since we're hearing about shoppers consolidating their trips. Wondering if you're still seeing that towards the tail end of 2Q into 3Q? Or if the inventory shortages are having a role in maybe offsetting some of that? And then also AUR sounds like it was driven lower by some of the clearance activity earlier in the quarter. Wonder if the AUR should still be expected to be down in 3Q or if we could start to see that stabilize now that you're so clean on inventory? \nTravis Marquette: This is Travis. In terms of the average basket, we do continue to see customers coming in a little bit less frequently but buying more when they do, so the average basket size continues to be up. That's sort of just generally towards the end of Q2. In terms of Q3, again, it's really early in the quarter. And I think it's really too early to draw trends, and we don't think we -- we're not providing further details on the breakdown of the sales, not at this time. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kate Fitzsimons from RBC Capital Markets. \nKate Fitzsimons: Travis, I believe you called out $65 million in COVID-related expenses in the quarter. Just directionally, as we move into the back half, is there any way to piecemeal how we should think about some of these enhanced cleaning, PPE, et cetera, as well as the labor piece. It sounds like in order to get the distribution centers more fully up and running, you're having to make some investments there. So just directionally, how should we think about some of these puts and takes, I guess, on the SG&A line as we move through the back half? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Sure. A couple of comments. The $65 million was both, as a remainder, in SG&A as well as COGS. As you might have guessed, the majority of those were in SG&A as it related to personal protection equipment, sanitation supplies, payroll, et cetera. As I mentioned, a portion of those did relate to costs related to restarting the business. And so that portion, we wouldn't expect to repeat. Having said that, we do expect elevated levels of COVID expenses as we continue to move through the year. Your question, specifically on the DC investments, those were not part of the $65 million in Q2. \nOperator: And your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious about the packaway opportunities that you're seeing today compared to a normal period. Maybe talk in terms of good, better, best, maybe you talk home versus apparel. And I'm also curious about the initial margins that you expect on packaway based on the deals that you're seeing?\n And then second, just curious if you could talk about the number of new vendor opportunities you're seeing. Is there any way to quantify what you're seeing out there? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of packaway opportunities, I don't know if I really can tell you by a good, better, best. Home versus apparels, apparel tends to be more packaway than home on -- normally on a normal basis. I think there are opportunities that are not perhaps as balanced as they've been in the past. The supply out there isn't as consistent across merchandise areas as the way it normally is.\n So the opportunities that are out there are perhaps not quite as balanced. What I would say is there are more opportunities in the last couple of weeks that seems to be emerging. And so we're feeling like packaway is moving in the right direction.  But again, it's not necessarily as broad based as it normally is because of the gaps of supply that are out there, created by all the issues from COVID and the market and all the things that have gone on there.\n In terms of the margin, we don't really look at packaway as a margin driver. We look at packaway as a sales driver. So in terms of -- if you're asking about pricing as it pertains to packaway, the merchants are out always looking for great deals on packaway. So packaway tends to be prices that are very sharp normally and is also something that we use to drive value into the stores. So in terms of a margin scenario, if we bought something that was a great deal, we would probably pass it along to the customer. Again, we use it as a sales driver.\n In terms of new vendors, obviously, we have a large merchant team, 900 merchants out there looking to open new resources, open new vendors. Situations like this, obviously, create opportunities, and sometimes people are a little bit more open to listen. And so we're out there now looking for new vendors and to see if we can expand the vendor base. And so that's kind of ongoing. And I think we'll continue to be ongoing. But that is a focus for merchants every day of the week is to try to expand the vendor base. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then just 1 follow-up. When we hear you talk about some gaps out there? Are the goods you want not available to you? Or were you just slower to bring demand than you should have been? \nBarbara Rentler: Two things. Well, the goods that are available as all closeouts are, closeouts are never consistent amongst every business any season, any year. I think this year, there's just been -- with everything that's gone on, which I know you're versed on in the market, in factories overseas. And there seems to be, I'll say, some bigger pockets. In terms of the pace at which we're buying it, I would say that when the -- when we reopen the stores, in retrospect, in hindsight, we probably could have gone out and started to buy a little bit sooner than we did as we started to ramp the stores back up.\n We didn't anticipate the consumer demand the way it turned out to be. So I feel like there was probably an opportunity that we could have done that a little bit better. But I'm not necessarily sure that, that would have impacted the assortment because I think the -- some of the gaps are just some -- they're just some big gaps. This classification is a business where they're there, and some where there's not. And our expectation is that over time, it will be a little bit more reasonable as vendors -- many vendors didn't commit and bring in some goods. And so it puts us in a chase. And the merchants are out there chasing and have been chasing since we opened, both for packaway or to flow-in stores. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Understanding all that there's obviously uncertainty today and quite along in the future. But on the back of these inventory conversations, do you have a view on what the broader pricing or promotional environment should look like going forward as thinking of holiday, which I know feels like it's so far ahead? And then just -- sorry for the dumb question. As you -- it's great that you had that packaway products to replenish the stores during the depletion. Any reason you wouldn't have gotten further into the packaway. Is that just seasonality? Or is there something other reason on this? \nBarbara Rentler: I couldn't hear the last part of your question on packaway you kind of faded out. I just need you to say the same thing over again, that would be great, the packaway piece. \nSimeon Siegel: Yes. Sorry. Just wondering, it's great that you were able to use the packaway to fill the stores. Is there any reason you didn't go deeper? And if the answer is seasonality then that \n your answer -- easy answer or something else on? \nBarbara Rentler: Meaning go deeper, meaning release work. \nSimeon Siegel: Yes. Bring more into the stores. \nBarbara Rentler: I think the packaway releases were what we thought was appropriate to flow to the stores at the time. So packaway is not it's a broad assortment of products that we put into the hotel. And so you flow them based off of what's the right timing, right product to the floor. So depending upon what the products were, that's how we flow it. Is not -- every business doesn't have packaway to it. Some of that packaway in the hotel could have been for fall.\n So we flowed what we thought was appropriate, and we flowed what we thought we needed to get through to make sure that we came in clean into the fall season. And that we weren't carrying residual products that we didn't want to have. So that's what determined what we released and how we released it.\n In terms of the promotional environment, I would expect that promotions will continue. It's a highly competitive environment. Retailers are trying to clear through all their excess inventory. And there'll be a long liquidation activity also coming from store closures, bankruptcy announcements. So our expectation is that it will be a promotional environment as we go forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Best of luck getting through the next couple of weeks of back-to-school. But can I ask you a question with -- I think you mentioned that transactions were down, and I'm assuming that's due to foot traffic, not conversion, but if you would confirm that? And then if you could talk a little bit about operationally, what your thoughts are on opening up the stores for longer hours, raising capacity levels as you get in closer to the peak season? And what are your thoughts around that, even if it's specific to just we'll extend it on the weekends, maybe not during the week. I'm just curious what your thinking is. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Marni. On transactions and conversions, we don't measure conversion. We use transactions as our proxy for traffic. So we don't measure that. On -- in terms of hours, so we did when we opened significantly reduced the hours we operate. We operated from 10 to 7. So we think that had some impact on the performance. As we move through the quarter, we have extended hours to 9 o'clock across the chain currently. And we haven't yet developed our hours for the holiday season. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs. \nAlexandra Walvis: Barbara, you mentioned in the prepared remarks there was a lot of uncertainty. Of course, heading into back-to-school and then to holiday. Can you talk a little bit about how you're planning the business into the second half, perhaps you referenced to the mid-teen to down mid-teens trend that you're seeing at the moment?\n And then my second question is on logistics costs. How are you expecting those to trend going forward? \nTravis Marquette: On logistics cost, given the wage increases, certainly in the back half of the year, we would expect to grow. But we also have cost savings throughout the business, including the distribution centers because as we staff up, we'll be able to improve our productivity as well. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. Could you do me a favor? Just repeat the back-to-school question because I didn't capture the first part of it. Could you say that again, please? \nOperator: It will be one moment while I locate the line. \nAlexandra Walvis: Now I was just wondering how conservatively you're planning the business into the back half, given all of the uncertainty about consumer behavior as we head into that important holiday season? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. We plan to continue to manage the business conservatively. I mean given all the ongoing COVID-19-related risks, including potential for additional rounds of store closures and distribution center closures. So our plan is to plan it conservatively and to chase our way back. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Two quick questions, if I could. The first 1 is, can you just give us an updated thought process around the resumption of a dividend or share repurchase? And the second question, I think, follows Alex's a bit. But when you think about the uncertainty that you have, can you just maybe talk about how you're planning sort of fall, winter, colder weather-type products in the back half with everything else that's going on? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Sure. This is Travis. Just with regard to the dividend and the share repurchase program, again, there's still, as we've mentioned several times, significant uncertainty in the market. We don't know what's going to happen with COVID, with consumer demand. And we really would need greater visibility on sales and the sustainability of those sales before we would start to consider or evaluate reinstituting either of those. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of how we're planning fall or winter products in the back half, we're planning the entire business conservatively. And so we would look at each 1 of those businesses, I'm assuming outerwear, sweaters, those type of businesses and plan them relative to the conservative plan. So we would have an assortment on the floor. And then if business took off at a greater rate than we expected, we would come back and chase some of those products. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Okay. Michael, are you seeing any difference in the trend line in the markets where the schools have announced virtual versus in-person? It sounds like that could have been a driver. Any evidence as the school systems are communicating in the local markets that back-to-school is showing up or it's a little late? And then I don't know if some of the schools are already passed back to school. Have you seen any improvement as you kind of move pass the back-to-school season in some of the southern markets at all? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. Michael, we wouldn't talk about current trends going into the quarter. We obviously gave the top line trend to give you an indication of what's going on overall. I'd say there's so many factors that we're seeing in the sales between the virus resurgence and unemployment trends and other things, I think it's really hard to see right now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Can you comment on your ability to get back into product and inventory if the environment, as we go through the back half of the year does improve from a traffic perspective? Obviously, see the inventory position now being pretty lean. So I'm just curious, the speed at which you can ramp back up and get goods into stores throughout the back half of the year? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we plan the business very conservatively. We think we've done that strategically. And we think that an appropriate approach to managing our business risk given these uncertain times. We've always -- as we always do, we'll chase the business with closeouts and supplement with packaway, and that is ordinary course of business for us. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: I mean obviously, we hope that this is a once in a lifetime event. But does the problem with getting inventory in stores quickly enough highlight a potential to build in more direct ship from vendors to stores so that you can be more flexible going forward if demand doesn't line up with your prior expectations? Or is this something that once DCs are running at full tilt shouldn't be a long-term problem? \nMichael Hartshorn: I think it's the latter. Once we have the DCs running at full tilt, we do not think it's a longer-term issue. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners. \nRoxanne Meyer: Great. I wanted to ask about any color you can provide on trends by category. Several of your peers have talked about the strength of home. And then related to that as a follow-up, you mentioned that you planned back-to-school business accordingly. So I was just wondering how comfortable you feel about your mix of goods in the store and your need to perhaps pivot categories to get to an ideal mix? And when you think that could be, if you're not there? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Let me start with the trends by merchandise, et cetera. Again, given the phased reopening of the stores and, in particular, the significant impact of clearance sales on results for the quarter, it's really hard to get a clear sense of product trends. So one thing that's clear is that the consumer during the quarter was very much more focused on home as opposed to apparel. \nBarbara Rentler: What I think you're at, Roxanne, also is just where are we seeing the shifts in product, where is the consumer heading versus where she's been. So yes, I would say, to Travis' point, home is certainly a place that the consumer has flocked to and is a business that we believe in. And actually, home gets bigger, as you know, as you enter into the fourth quarter. I would think also in apparel, the shift that we're starting to see, which I think everyone is starting to see, is the consumer moving more towards casual products, activewear, athletic wear, as perhaps she's working remotely now.\n And so making that pivot in that shift is where we're going. We normally have a large casual business. Our carrier businesses have never been the biggest part of our apparel at Ross ever. And so for us, it's really about shifting even more dollars over there as the consumer has moved in that direction. And that's what we would see in the back-to-school businesses like the juniors or young men, you would see that same shift on the floor now and a continued shift because that is the bulk of where those businesses are for us normally. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the dd's business, are you seeing the same trends at dd's as you are -- as compared to Ross? And then as you think about your vendor base, Barbara, is this an opportunity to also expand the vendor base? And are terms of payments at all being adjusted permanently in the industry from what happened in the short term? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, on dd's, I'd say that dd's experienced somewhat similar performance as Ross, the supply chain and buying ramp-up issues impacted the entire company and that included both Ross and dd's. \nBarbara Rentler: And from a vendor based perspective, obviously, we're always trying to expand the vendor base. And usually, when business is difficult is when there are often more potential opportunities to expand that base, so the merchants are focused on trying to do that every day and particularly now.\n In terms of terms and adjustments permanently in the industry, I think I really couldn't comment on what globally that looks like for the entire industry. I think there's been a lot going on in the last few months. And so I think everyone is reacting to what they need to do for the business, but I really can talk about a permanent shift in the industry. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. \nJamie Merriman: Barbara, when you're talking about sort of pivoting to categories that are strong. Just can you just talk a little bit about how that works and the timing in terms of how often buying budgets are allocated? I'm just really wondering like how quickly you could really pivot assortments, if necessary? And then you talked in your prepared remarks about thinking through and sort of weighing the risk of future shutdowns. So -- and given your comments around the DC locations of California and Pennsylvania, can you just remind us of where your big DCs are located? And if there are sort of risk mitigation strategies you can put in place if there were say shutdowns that impacted the California DCs? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the DCs about a little -- over half of our capacity is on the West Coast. We have DCs in the Bakersfield Central Valley area, 1 DC there, several in Riverside. We also have a DC in Pennsylvania and 2 in South Carolina. If we had to shut down the California DCs, it would have a significant impact on the chain.\n As far as mitigation strategies, obviously, it's going to be important for us in our future growth. Our next DC opens in Houston. We'll have another DC somewhat after that, that we would expect to be non-California. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. And in terms of pivoting to categories that are strong, how quick you can do it? I mean it literally depends on each category in each size range and gender. So I couldn't give you a specific time. But what I would tell you is that we would be more aggressively pursuing those categories base -- and then based off of supply in the shorter term, we would drive it as much as we can. And in the longer term, what will usually happens is when there is a trend shift, the market follows that trend shift and then the supply all naturally kind of goes there. And so then you can take a bigger lift than perhaps you can initially as the market recognizes what's working and what's not working themselves. \nOperator: your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: Barbara, my question is you mentioned there's a lot of near-term factors impacting the trend in the third quarter so far, back-to-school, like a stimulus, the inventory issue, the rising COVID cases. But to what extent do you think traffic is being impacted by perhaps customers going online and finding bargains there because they're just not comfortable coming to the stores right now?\n And then Michael, just want to follow-up on the question about the DC staffing. Can you just explain a little bit more about what the challenges have been about? Is it people not coming back? Were they furloughed? And then when you tried to bring them back they just -- they weren't -- they found other jobs, or they just didn't want to come back, so you've had to raise wages? If you could just explain that a little bit more, that would be appreciated. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the DCs, we did furlough our associates, and we operate the DCs with both temp labor and perm labor -- permanent labor for surge capacity. We did see our permanent workforce good retention in returning from furlough. But I suspect with the surge of e-commerce and the impact of commerce coming back post closure. The warehousing competitive labor market has increased quickly and significantly. So I think those are the main factors on what's driving the DC staffing shortfall. I would also add that in a COVID environment, we want to make sure that people are safe, and we don't want them coming to work if sick. So there's also things like attendance that we're addressing as well. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the impact of online in our business, I think that's hard for us to measure the exact relationship of that. Obviously, online business has been very good, especially in essential businesses and core basics and things like that. But I think it's hard for me to put a number to what that impact could be to our current business trend. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: I'll follow-up on Jay's question, but I'll ask it differently. Not necessarily e-commerce, but I know you guys, I'm sure you have good communication with your customers. When you talk to them about why they're not coming back as much as they did last year, is it between the COVID concerns, the economy and maybe the customer lost their job or income of the family has gone down? And then thirdly, your own inventory shortage, not having the right stuff in store. Do you know which is the main factor? Like is there a rank order of those? Is there any way you kind of talk to that? \nMichael Hartshorn: Ike, I would say, it's hard to break out between those components. I think it's very clear that the #1 factor is the impact of the virus. As we said in our comments, that the markets that were impacted the most were also the markets that had the largest outbreak. So I think that's clear that, that's the #1 factor. But I don't want to minimize. We think we could have done things better during the quarter. So there are factors that we talked about with inventory that we think we can impact. So the bottom line is we're going to work on our own execution and do the things that we can do to impact the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just one quick one for me. Just I'm curious, just in those FCAT states, if you're still seeing subdued sales here in August or if they were -- hope they have recovered back to sort of the national average? \nTravis Marquette: I didn't hear the first part of the question. \nCharles Grom: Just on the sales in those FCAT states. I'm just wondering if the sales are covered, Florida, California, Texas, Arizona. \nTravis Marquette: In those states, they continue to trail the chain. We have seen some small improvement. \nOperator: And your last question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I was wondering if you can talk about if we are in a reduced traffic environment as we go into the holiday season, changes to the store operating procedures for Black Friday and then into the critical pre-holiday weeks, any changes to hours or traffic-driving events or something of that sort? And then for Michael or Travis, if you can talk about what portion is distribution center payroll versus total payroll, like employee payroll, not including corporate headquarters? I imagine you're not seeing as much of that wage pressure at the store payroll line, but if you can talk about anything, did people come back or didn't come back similar to the DCs? Or is that normalized? \nMichael Hartshorn: I'll try to hit through those. I'm going to go in reverse order. We're not seeing the same issues in the stores, and that's likely -- again, the DCs were impacted by the surge in e-commerce with the closures of a number of bricks-and-mortar retailers. We're not having that same issue in the stores. And then in terms of holiday plans, we wouldn't discuss those at this point as we're still working through those plans. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of events, Black Friday, we don't really run events. Our thing is that we want to make sure that we have great branded values on the floor. And obviously, our inventories levels go up in that time period. And that's what the customer values, and that's what we look to do to drive traffic is just having great branded bargains on the floor. \nOperator: And I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish you and your families continued health and safety. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with an update on the status of the company's operations, including some color on our store reopenings, followed by a review of our second quarter performance. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As a reminder, all store and distribution center locations were closed from March 20 through May 14, when we began a phased process of resuming operations. On average, our stores were open for about 75% of the quarter, though operating on shorter hours compared to the prior year. All our distribution centers were reopened by the end of May.\n The ongoing COVID-19 health crisis remains very fluid, and we continue to closely monitor local developments to assess any potential changes to our operations as mandated by local, state or other government directives. We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and customers as we navigate through this pandemic.\n Turning now to our financials. Total sales for the second quarter were $2.7 billion compared to $4 billion in the prior year, reflecting the negative impact from store closures during the period. Comparable store sales were down 12% for reopened stores from the date of the reopening to the end of the fiscal quarter. Sales during the quarter were significantly impacted by several factors including COVID-19's negative effect on consumer demand, particularly in California, Florida, and Arizona, which represents about 50% of our store base.\n Further, during the initial reopenings, overall sales were ahead of our conservative plans as we benefited from pent-up demand and aggressive markdowns to clear aged inventory. In the weeks thereafter, trends were negatively impacted from depleted store inventory levels, while we were ramping up our buying and distribution capabilities. For the 13 weeks ended August 1, 2020, earnings per share were $0.06 on net income of $22 million. This compares to net income of $413 million or earnings per share of $1.14 for the same period last year. Year-to-date, the loss per share was $0.81 versus earnings per share of $2.29 last year.\n Our net loss of $284 million is compared to net income of $834 million in the first half of 2019. Sales for the first 6 months of 2020 declined 42% to $4.5 billion. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 39% from the prior year, with average store inventories down 10% versus the same period last year.\n Packaway levels at quarter end were 25% of the total compared to last year's 43% as we use packaway to replenish store inventory throughout the quarter. As planned, we did not open any new stores in the second quarter. We continue to expect to add about 39 locations this fall for a total of 66 new stores for the full year.\n Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our second quarter results. Thank you, Travis. Aside from the pandemic impact on consumer demand, as initial reopening sales significantly exceeded our conservative forecast, we were unable to ramp up our buying and distribution capabilities quickly enough to adequately replenish stores. As Travis mentioned earlier, the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis remains extremely uncertain, and we have limited insight into how this pandemic could further impact consumer demand and the retail and economic landscape. There is additional risk if COVID-19 cases remain elevated or increased, potentially prompting larger scale shutdowns of our operations. Given these uncertainties, we believe the most prudent approach is to plan and manage the business very cautiously, while continuing to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and associates.\n As we move forward during this challenging period, we remain confident that our strong financial foundation and outstanding team of experienced off-price executives will help see us through these uncertain times.\n Over the longer term, we remain well positioned as an off-price retailer to continue to gain market share given the large number of retail store closures and consumers' continued focus on value and convenience. We've proven in the past that we have successfully competed in this type of retail environment and believe we will do so again.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. Sure. Overall, we continue to see a lot of supply out there, but it's not as consistent across the merchandise areas. We believe that these creates opportunities in some products in some areas and gaps in other areas. In terms of stronger trendier categories, that's kind of a broad question. But I would say in most businesses, there has been supply in that -- without having what that trendy category is, kind of hard to comment on it. But what I would say is that in key categories, the merchants are out there chasing every day, and we have very conservative plans that they're working towards. And I think over time, in the categories that have, I'll say, gaps in the assortment today, I think eventually, that will catch up. And in terms of the content of packaway, I mean, we're pleased with the content the pathway we have now. We don't feel like we have any residual issues or anything from spring. As to Michael's point, we used packaway to drive our business in Q2 and got through everything. So of the levels that we own, we feel fine about the content. And in terms of just packaway in general, the merchants, as you know, packaway fluctuates normally. And the merchants are out there chasing packaway now looking for spring product, current product, whatever the great deals are, because the most important thing about packaway is that what you own is really great content. Okay. And then as it pertains to the assortment and back-to-school, we plan those businesses very conservatively. We made the adjustments in the assortments that we thought were appropriate based on what was going on in the outside world with children going back-to-school or not. And obviously, we're still in back-to-school. So it's kind of hard to rate the total experience. But we went in with pretty conservative plans for back-to-school. Sure. In terms of packaway opportunities, I don't know if I really can tell you by a good, better, best. Home versus apparels, apparel tends to be more packaway than home on -- normally on a normal basis. I think there are opportunities that are not perhaps as balanced as they've been in the past. The supply out there isn't as consistent across merchandise areas as the way it normally is.\n So the opportunities that are out there are perhaps not quite as balanced. What I would say is there are more opportunities in the last couple of weeks that seems to be emerging. And so we're feeling like packaway is moving in the right direction.  But again, it's not necessarily as broad based as it normally is because of the gaps of supply that are out there, created by all the issues from COVID and the market and all the things that have gone on there.\n In terms of the margin, we don't really look at packaway as a margin driver. We look at packaway as a sales driver. So in terms of -- if you're asking about pricing as it pertains to packaway, the merchants are out always looking for great deals on packaway. So packaway tends to be prices that are very sharp normally and is also something that we use to drive value into the stores. So in terms of a margin scenario, if we bought something that was a great deal, we would probably pass it along to the customer. Again, we use it as a sales driver.\n In terms of new vendors, obviously, we have a large merchant team, 900 merchants out there looking to open new resources, open new vendors. Situations like this, obviously, create opportunities, and sometimes people are a little bit more open to listen. And so we're out there now looking for new vendors and to see if we can expand the vendor base. And so that's kind of ongoing. And I think we'll continue to be ongoing. But that is a focus for merchants every day of the week is to try to expand the vendor base. Two things. Well, the goods that are available as all closeouts are, closeouts are never consistent amongst every business any season, any year. I think this year, there's just been -- with everything that's gone on, which I know you're versed on in the market, in factories overseas. And there seems to be, I'll say, some bigger pockets. In terms of the pace at which we're buying it, I would say that when the -- when we reopen the stores, in retrospect, in hindsight, we probably could have gone out and started to buy a little bit sooner than we did as we started to ramp the stores back up.\n We didn't anticipate the consumer demand the way it turned out to be. So I feel like there was probably an opportunity that we could have done that a little bit better. But I'm not necessarily sure that, that would have impacted the assortment because I think the -- some of the gaps are just some -- they're just some big gaps. This classification is a business where they're there, and some where there's not. And our expectation is that over time, it will be a little bit more reasonable as vendors -- many vendors didn't commit and bring in some goods. And so it puts us in a chase. And the merchants are out there chasing and have been chasing since we opened, both for packaway or to flow-in stores. I couldn't hear the last part of your question on packaway you kind of faded out. I just need you to say the same thing over again, that would be great, the packaway piece. Meaning go deeper, meaning release work. I think the packaway releases were what we thought was appropriate to flow to the stores at the time. So packaway is not it's a broad assortment of products that we put into the hotel. And so you flow them based off of what's the right timing, right product to the floor. So depending upon what the products were, that's how we flow it. Is not -- every business doesn't have packaway to it. Some of that packaway in the hotel could have been for fall.\n So we flowed what we thought was appropriate, and we flowed what we thought we needed to get through to make sure that we came in clean into the fall season. And that we weren't carrying residual products that we didn't want to have. So that's what determined what we released and how we released it.\n In terms of the promotional environment, I would expect that promotions will continue. It's a highly competitive environment. Retailers are trying to clear through all their excess inventory. And there'll be a long liquidation activity also coming from store closures, bankruptcy announcements. So our expectation is that it will be a promotional environment as we go forward. Okay. Could you do me a favor? Just repeat the back-to-school question because I didn't capture the first part of it. Could you say that again, please? Sure. We plan to continue to manage the business conservatively. I mean given all the ongoing COVID-19-related risks, including potential for additional rounds of store closures and distribution center closures. So our plan is to plan it conservatively and to chase our way back. And in terms of how we're planning fall or winter products in the back half, we're planning the entire business conservatively. And so we would look at each 1 of those businesses, I'm assuming outerwear, sweaters, those type of businesses and plan them relative to the conservative plan. So we would have an assortment on the floor. And then if business took off at a greater rate than we expected, we would come back and chase some of those products. What I think you're at, Roxanne, also is just where are we seeing the shifts in product, where is the consumer heading versus where she's been. So yes, I would say, to Travis' point, home is certainly a place that the consumer has flocked to and is a business that we believe in. And actually, home gets bigger, as you know, as you enter into the fourth quarter. I would think also in apparel, the shift that we're starting to see, which I think everyone is starting to see, is the consumer moving more towards casual products, activewear, athletic wear, as perhaps she's working remotely now.\n And so making that pivot in that shift is where we're going. We normally have a large casual business. Our carrier businesses have never been the biggest part of our apparel at Ross ever. And so for us, it's really about shifting even more dollars over there as the consumer has moved in that direction. And that's what we would see in the back-to-school businesses like the juniors or young men, you would see that same shift on the floor now and a continued shift because that is the bulk of where those businesses are for us normally. And from a vendor based perspective, obviously, we're always trying to expand the vendor base. And usually, when business is difficult is when there are often more potential opportunities to expand that base, so the merchants are focused on trying to do that every day and particularly now.\n In terms of terms and adjustments permanently in the industry, I think I really couldn't comment on what globally that looks like for the entire industry. I think there's been a lot going on in the last few months. And so I think everyone is reacting to what they need to do for the business, but I really can talk about a permanent shift in the industry. Sure. And in terms of pivoting to categories that are strong, how quick you can do it? I mean it literally depends on each category in each size range and gender. So I couldn't give you a specific time. But what I would tell you is that we would be more aggressively pursuing those categories base -- and then based off of supply in the shorter term, we would drive it as much as we can. And in the longer term, what will usually happens is when there is a trend shift, the market follows that trend shift and then the supply all naturally kind of goes there. And so then you can take a bigger lift than perhaps you can initially as the market recognizes what's working and what's not working themselves. And in terms of the impact of online in our business, I think that's hard for us to measure the exact relationship of that. Obviously, online business has been very good, especially in essential businesses and core basics and things like that. But I think it's hard for me to put a number to what that impact could be to our current business trend. And in terms of events, Black Friday, we don't really run events. Our thing is that we want to make sure that we have great branded values on the floor. And obviously, our inventories levels go up in that time period. And that's what the customer values, and that's what we look to do to drive traffic is just having great branded bargains on the floor. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. We wish you and your families continued health and safety. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Matt, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the recent trends, I think there's a number of factors that are impacting what we're seeing currently. I certainly think there are things internally that we can focus on in terms of execution. We're still not where we want to be on ramping up the DCs and continue to have lower receipts than planned. I do think there are external factors that include things like the expiration of unemployment that happened at the end of July, obviously, with no back-to-school as the country has moved to distance learning. I think those are the primary factors.\n And looking on long-term growth, obviously, the pre-COVID trend had customers migrating to value and convenience. And this disruption just accelerated those trends with a number of store closures, our value proposition and 1,800 and growing conveniently located store locations, I think we have a significant opportunity to gain market share over the longer term. Lorraine, on the stocking, I'm going to go through the sequence of the quarter, and that will help explain the actions that we're taking to get inventory levels that are appropriate for the plan. When we first began our phased opening of stores, that's the first thing we did, and then we opened our DCs. And we did it in that order because of government restrictions in California and actually Pennsylvania at that point in time. Because sales exceeded our conservative expectations when we reopened, at the same time, we were ramping and initially opening and initially ramping our DCs, the result was the depleted store inventory. The initial ramp-up of our distribution centers took longer than we had hoped. And we've had further difficulty ramping up our DCs to full capacity due to staffing challenges.\n We've taken aggressive steps to improve our production levels that include higher wages and incentives. And believe those actions will allow us to quickly -- more quickly ramp up to peak capacity over the next few months. So I think we would expect to see improvement as we progress through the quarter. Kimberly, it's Michael. On the regional trends, Texas, Florida, California and Arizona underperformed the rest of the chain by significant margins. Now part of that is driven by the resurgence in those areas during the quarter. So they had a significant impact on the overall performance. Trends in certain areas have improved as the cases improved. And then on the current trend, we do believe that part of the current trend is driven by lower-than-planned receipts with the DCs continuing to ramp up. So we do think that, that is a factor in the current trend. Sure, Kimberly. I think I would repeat my comment with Lorraine. We've taken aggressive actions in the DCs. We probably took them later than we should, but we do expect to -- we do expect those actions to improve our throughput and bring the levels up to peak capacity over the next couple months. Sure, Marni. On transactions and conversions, we don't measure conversion. We use transactions as our proxy for traffic. So we don't measure that. On -- in terms of hours, so we did when we opened significantly reduced the hours we operate. We operated from 10 to 7. So we think that had some impact on the performance. As we move through the quarter, we have extended hours to 9 o'clock across the chain currently. And we haven't yet developed our hours for the holiday season. Yes. Michael, we wouldn't talk about current trends going into the quarter. We obviously gave the top line trend to give you an indication of what's going on overall. I'd say there's so many factors that we're seeing in the sales between the virus resurgence and unemployment trends and other things, I think it's really hard to see right now. I think it's the latter. Once we have the DCs running at full tilt, we do not think it's a longer-term issue. Dana, on dd's, I'd say that dd's experienced somewhat similar performance as Ross, the supply chain and buying ramp-up issues impacted the entire company and that included both Ross and dd's. On the DCs about a little -- over half of our capacity is on the West Coast. We have DCs in the Bakersfield Central Valley area, 1 DC there, several in Riverside. We also have a DC in Pennsylvania and 2 in South Carolina. If we had to shut down the California DCs, it would have a significant impact on the chain.\n As far as mitigation strategies, obviously, it's going to be important for us in our future growth. Our next DC opens in Houston. We'll have another DC somewhat after that, that we would expect to be non-California. Sure. On the DCs, we did furlough our associates, and we operate the DCs with both temp labor and perm labor -- permanent labor for surge capacity. We did see our permanent workforce good retention in returning from furlough. But I suspect with the surge of e-commerce and the impact of commerce coming back post closure. The warehousing competitive labor market has increased quickly and significantly. So I think those are the main factors on what's driving the DC staffing shortfall. I would also add that in a COVID environment, we want to make sure that people are safe, and we don't want them coming to work if sick. So there's also things like attendance that we're addressing as well. Ike, I would say, it's hard to break out between those components. I think it's very clear that the #1 factor is the impact of the virus. As we said in our comments, that the markets that were impacted the most were also the markets that had the largest outbreak. So I think that's clear that, that's the #1 factor. But I don't want to minimize. We think we could have done things better during the quarter. So there are factors that we talked about with inventory that we think we can impact. So the bottom line is we're going to work on our own execution and do the things that we can do to impact the business. I'll try to hit through those. I'm going to go in reverse order. We're not seeing the same issues in the stores, and that's likely -- again, the DCs were impacted by the surge in e-commerce with the closures of a number of bricks-and-mortar retailers. We're not having that same issue in the stores. And then in terms of holiday plans, we wouldn't discuss those at this point as we're still working through those plans."

            "name": "Travis Marquette",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara noted, stores operated on average for 75% of the period with comparable store sales down 12% versus last year from the date of their reopenings to the end of the fiscal quarter. The decline was driven by a lower number of transactions that was partially offset by a larger average basket size. Average unit retail was down during the period, reflecting the strong sell-through of deeply discounted aged inventory.\n Operating margin for the quarter was 3.2% compared to 13.7% last year. Both cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the deleveraging effect from lower sales versus last year and expenditures for COVID-19-related measures. In addition, cost of goods sold was impacted by the unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses. These higher costs were somewhat offset by the partial reversal of the inventory valuation reserve we took in the first quarter resulting from the faster-than-expected sell-through of aged inventory. This reversal benefited the second quarter by $174 million or $0.19 per share.\n Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter in cost of goods sold and SG&A combined were approximately $65 million, primarily for costs associated with restarting the business, supplies, cleaning and payroll related to additional safety protocols.\n We ended the quarter in a healthy financial position with over $4.3 billion in liquidity, which includes an ending unrestricted cash balance of about $3.8 billion and an undrawn $500 million revolver.\n As we move into the third quarter, trends have not materially changed from the second quarter, with comparable store sales for the first 2.5 weeks trending down mid-teens versus last year. Given the lack of visibility on the potential impact from this ongoing health crisis, we are not providing sales or earnings guidance.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes. Sure, Matthew. This is Travis. In terms of the margin components for this quarter, similar to last quarter, given the significant deleveraging effect of having our stores closed for a portion of the quarter, we're not providing specific margin components. The puts and takes this quarter, I covered in my remarks. And then in terms of the go-forward look, again, given the ongoing uncertainty, we're not providing any forward guidance or commentary on future margins right now. This is Travis. In terms of the average basket, we do continue to see customers coming in a little bit less frequently but buying more when they do, so the average basket size continues to be up. That's sort of just generally towards the end of Q2. In terms of Q3, again, it's really early in the quarter. And I think it's really too early to draw trends, and we don't think we -- we're not providing further details on the breakdown of the sales, not at this time. Yes. Sure. A couple of comments. The $65 million was both, as a remainder, in SG&A as well as COGS. As you might have guessed, the majority of those were in SG&A as it related to personal protection equipment, sanitation supplies, payroll, et cetera. As I mentioned, a portion of those did relate to costs related to restarting the business. And so that portion, we wouldn't expect to repeat. Having said that, we do expect elevated levels of COVID expenses as we continue to move through the year. Your question, specifically on the DC investments, those were not part of the $65 million in Q2. On logistics cost, given the wage increases, certainly in the back half of the year, we would expect to grow. But we also have cost savings throughout the business, including the distribution centers because as we staff up, we'll be able to improve our productivity as well. Yes. Sure. This is Travis. Just with regard to the dividend and the share repurchase program, again, there's still, as we've mentioned several times, significant uncertainty in the market. We don't know what's going to happen with COVID, with consumer demand. And we really would need greater visibility on sales and the sustainability of those sales before we would start to consider or evaluate reinstituting either of those. Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we plan the business very conservatively. We think we've done that strategically. And we think that an appropriate approach to managing our business risk given these uncertain times. We've always -- as we always do, we'll chase the business with closeouts and supplement with packaway, and that is ordinary course of business for us. Yes. Let me start with the trends by merchandise, et cetera. Again, given the phased reopening of the stores and, in particular, the significant impact of clearance sales on results for the quarter, it's really hard to get a clear sense of product trends. So one thing that's clear is that the consumer during the quarter was very much more focused on home as opposed to apparel. I didn't hear the first part of the question. In those states, they continue to trail the chain. We have seen some small improvement."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores First Quarter Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call may contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future operations and financial results, including store openings and reopenings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements and from historical performance or current expectations. \n Additional information about related risk factors is included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2019 Form 10-K and fiscal 2020 Form 8-K is on file with the SEC. \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with an update on the current status of the company's operations, including our store reopening plans, followed by a review of our first quarter performance and details of our financial position entering the second quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As a reminder, all store and distribution center locations were closed from March 20 through the quarter end to help prevent the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Further, our corporate and buying offices were also closed with most associates continuing to work remotely. With the closure of our retail operations, we made the difficult but necessary decision to temporarily furlough the majority of our store and distribution center associates as well as some other employees across the business effective April 5. \n More recently, on May 14, we began a phased process of reopening stores on a market-by-market basis. This followed a careful review of current guidance from health officials and advisers as well as federal, state and local governments. Approximately 700 stores have reopened, since with the remaining stores expected to be reopened over the coming weeks. Our top priority will always be the health and well-being of our associates and customers, and we will only reopen stores when it is safe to do so. \n Further, the state of the pandemic remains very dynamic, and these plans could change materially as we cautiously move forward. As we restart operations, we are implementing a variety of measures with the goal of keeping our associates, customers and the communities we serve, safe. These measures will include additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces, providing associates with personal protective equipment based on CDC or other health guidelines and implementing physical distancing practices. \n We will also be reopening and ramping up our distribution center network in the coming weeks. In addition, we expect to reopen our corporate and buying offices in the coming months. As with our stores, we are putting in place additional health and safety measures across all areas of these facilities. \n Turning now to our financials. As noted in today's press release, our first quarter results reflect the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business which led to the closure of all stores from March 20 through the end of the quarter and of our first quarterly loss in more than 30 years. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down from $3.8 billion in the prior year. Given that stores were open for less than 7 weeks of the 13-week period, the comparable store sales metric is not meaningful for the quarter. For the 13 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we incurred a loss per share of $0.87 versus earnings per share of $1.15 for the same period last year. \n The net loss for the period was $306 million versus net income of $421 million last year. In addition to the significant negative impact due to the lack of revenue from the closure of all stores beginning March 20, our operating loss also includes a onetime noncash inventory valuation charge relating to the portion of the inventory that we now expect to sell below our original cost. As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories, net of this valuation charge were down 3% over the prior year with packaway levels at 42% of the total compared to last year's 44%. \n Average in-store inventories were up 1% at quarter end versus the same period last year. Turning to store growth. We opened 20 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter and ended the period with 1,832 total stores. Given the significant uncertainty of consumer behavior and shopping patterns as stores reopen, we will not open new stores in the current quarter and now expect to open about 39 stores this fall for a total of 66 new stores for the full year. \n Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our financial position entering the second quarter. \nTravis Marquette: Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, we reported a net loss of $306 million or $0.87 per share for the first quarter. Operating margin for the period reflects the impact of the significant revenue decline from our store closures as well as a onetime noncash inventory valuation charge of $313 million or $0.58 per share. \n As a reminder, we are on the lower of cost or net realizable value method of accounting for inventory, which provides that most markdowns are recognized when inventory is sold unless the markdown takes the item's value below costs. The onetime valuation charge in the first quarter reflects our estimate of inventory that we expect to sell below cost in the coming months. This first quarter reserve, therefore, reflects only a small portion of the total markdowns, we believe will be necessary to sell through the existing spring inventory. We expect that the vast majority of markdown activity will occur in the second quarter. It is important to note that the ultimate impact of these markdowns will depend on the pace of sell-through as we move through the quarter. \n Now let's discuss our current financial position and balance sheet. As noted in our press release, in response to the severe economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly took decisive actions to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility. These included drawing down $800 million under our existing revolving credit facility, completing a $2 billion senior unsecured public bond offering and obtaining a new undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. As previously announced, we suspended our stock repurchase program on March 19. Before doing so, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of about $132 million. We have no plans to repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. In addition, we also announced today the suspension of our quarterly dividend payments. We are also aggressively cutting costs throughout the company by minimizing nonbusiness critical operating expenses, rightsizing our merchandise receipt and inventory plans and reducing capital expenditures to further enhance our liquidity. \n Capital expenditures for this year are now projected to be approximately $420 million, down from our initial guidance of $730 million. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with over $3 billion in liquidity, which includes an ending unrestricted cash balance of about $2.7 billion and the new $500 million revolver. As Barbara mentioned earlier, we are in the early stages of resuming operations by reopening groups of stores as it becomes safe to do so over the coming weeks. \n However, we have no visibility on how quickly consumer demand will recover and the impact this will have on store traffic. Given these unknowns, we are not providing second quarter sales and earnings guidance or an updated annual fiscal 2020 outlook at this time. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Travis. We want to reiterate that given the extraordinary global health crisis created by COVID-19, the safety and wellbeing of our associates and customers will always be of the utmost important to us. Considering the uncertainty on how this health crisis could impact consumers, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to managing our business. \n Looking ahead, I want to emphasize that we have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business. And as Travis noted, a very strong financial foundation. We also see significant opportunities in the marketplace to acquire some of the best brands ever -- bargains ever. Longer term, we remain well positioned in the off-price sector and believe consumers will continue to favor retailers focused on delivering both value and convenience, all this makes us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate through these challenging times. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I know it's early days on the store openings, but I was wondering if you could just provide some performance details for those stores that have been open, how they're trending? \nMichael Hartshorn: Hi, Lorraine, it's Michael Hartshorn. Stores for us have been reopened less than a week. So we wouldn't provide commentary at this point. Beyond the initial openings though, as Travis talked about in his commentary, there's a number of factors that will impact consumer demand post opening, including the economy on the backside of commerce reopening, changes to customer behaviors, impact of social distancing and certainly, the competitive environment among others. So at this point, we can't predict what's going to happen after we reopen the stores for the remainder of the year. We do believe, though, there'll be a negative impact on consumer demand throughout the remainder of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I was hoping you could talk a bit more about the process of realigning inventory. Obviously, you took the write-down here in the quarter. How long do you think it will take to clear through some of the seasonally inappropriate goods and make room for fresh inventory? And then just any context on how aggressive you're being with purchases in the marketplace today? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. In terms of inventory, again, given the fact that our stores were closed for 2 months, we do have a substantial amount of aged seasonal goods. Again, with the abrupt closure of the stores and the significant broad-based decline and trends leading immediately preceding the stores, again, inventories were misaligned. So in that light, we reviewed our inventory position and assessed the markdown risk that we had. And have recorded in the first quarter, the portion of markdowns that we believe will be below cost. In terms of ultimately what the sell-through and how long it will take to move through those, again, it really depends. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't know how quickly the consumer will return to our stores. As Michael mentioned, there's a lot of economic factors that will influence that. \n And ultimately, as I mentioned, the impact of the markdowns will depend on what that rate of sell-through is as we move through the quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of fresh inventory in the stores, obviously, we're just first opening our stores now and trying to liquidate the goods that are in the stores and also the goods that were in process outside the DCs and in the DCs. So we need to first work through that. The merchants have not been actively buying in the marketplace. They've been staying very close to their vendors. And after we understand a little bit more about what sales and sell-throughs can look like, we will go back into the market, I would say, with a very surgical lens of what it is we need and what we can understand of what we think the customer wants. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kate Fitzsimons from RBC Capital Markets. \nKate Fitzsimons: I guess, an extension of the last question is just when you are finally willing to go back into the marketplace and buy, how are you evaluating category opportunities on the other side of this? We've heard from some peers about home outperforming, maybe more than fashion apparel. So just curious to maybe how industry trends could be dictating how you will be buying in -- out of the gate? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Category opportunity. First, I think we have to see as we sell through our inventory, what the customer is voting for, whether it's apparel or home. The home business overall has had a trend for a long period of time, one would expect that home, go forward, would still be a good category, especially as people are kind of home nesting and buying things that perhaps they normally might buy. But with that, it will really depend on what the opportunities are out there in both apparel and in home. We see a lot of goods out there. We're anticipating that there'll be a lot of great closeouts and branded bargains for the customer. So I don't want to put sides around saying it's one business versus the other. I think in this environment, a lot of the deals may dictate where the sales would come from. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nTracy Kogan: It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I was wondering if you guys could talk about how you're thinking about packaway in this environment? And maybe if you might be packing things away for less time than you normally would? And as a corollary to that, how quickly could you flow things into stores? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the speed, Tracy, on the speed, we can flow inventory from packaway very quickly, a matter of days through the DC and a matter of a week or 2 into the stores. \nBarbara Rentler: And just in terms of just the thought process around buying packaway, I'm assuming you may pack away that I could release earlier than packaway that it might not release till March of next year. Is that really your question? \nTracy Kogan: Exactly. \nBarbara Rentler: I think it depends on what the product is, right? So in some classifications of product, there'll be goods that would be appropriate sooner than later. And in some products, some classifications, you would really have to hold it until the spring season, if it's truly spring product. So it varies based off of the classification and the gender, the timing, the whole thing. But there's a lot of product out there in total. So I would say there's a lot of choices, some of which probably could flow a little sooner. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: I wanted to understand if you have excluded packaway from your inventory, how many weeks of inventory would you typically have on hand? Is it sort of 8 weeks or 10 weeks at normal sales volume? And then secondarily, are all of your distribution centers also reopening at this time? And as your stores are reopening, are you in a position to be able to actively flow inventory to stores now that you've got some of them opening? \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on the distribution centers, we have management teams in all of our distribution centers and are ramping -- preparing to ramp up production, and that includes California, the Carolinas and also in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. So we're ready to start the DCs. In South Carolina, we've already started production and prepared to start backfilling stores as they need. \nTravis Marquette: In terms of in-store inventory turns, again, if you just focus on in-store only, our turns are quite quick. I don't think we've quantified that specifically in the past, but it would be significantly faster than if you're just trying to look at the total inventory metric on the balance sheet. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. And lastly, I'm wondering if you have any comments on just how business was trending pre-COVID for either the month of February or the month of February and the first week of March, just any way to understand directionally how the business was moving before we went into this very, very unusual time. \nTravis Marquette: Sure. As we talked about previously, sales trends were above plan in February, and we felt good about sales up until early March when, I think, as we talked about, there was a very rapid deceleration just prior to when we closed our stores on March 20. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. And lastly, is there any way for us to think about where you would expect second quarter inventory to land? And would you -- do you feel like you would be able to work through the aged inventory that you're sitting with today? Is it your expectation that you will have cleared through and moved through that aged inventory by the end of the second quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on pace, our goal is to move through it in the second quarter. And we're going to operate the business very, very cautiously, both inventory, sales, expenses, capital, and we're going to put ourselves in a position of strength so that we can chase the business, leverage expenses. So we would expect inventory to be down at the end of the second quarter. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I was wondering if you can talk to us about comparisons to the post 2008, the 2009 and '10 recovery period? And what opportunity you see from potential bankruptcies, all at J. C. Penney? And then for Michael or Travis, if you can quickly talk about when you're opening the stores, just curious, how are you layering in payroll hours? How are you metering throughput? And then what's happening to the basket size? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. We wouldn't comment on basket size. Again, the stores have been only opened a week. Obviously, there's local regulations on how to meter in and out of the stores. We have security at the front of each store that's metering based on those predetermined occupancy limits, in most cases, we're below -- even below metering than what the restrictions require to make sure we keep customers and associates safe. \n We have included payroll to make sure that we're keeping safe distances and trying to move people through the registers as appropriate. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of a comparison to 2008, I think the current retail environment is different. Obviously, this crisis is much worse. We're expecting the recovery to be much slower. During the financial crisis, we didn't have to close stores. We didn't have to navigate through health and safety mandates, shelter in place, social distancing. So we think this is very different, and we think it will be a slow recovery on our way back. In terms of Penney's and bankruptcies, there's been a lot of bankruptcies I think long term, the way for us to think about it is that there's an opportunity for market share, particularly in the moderate portion of the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mike Baker from Nomura. \nMichael Baker: Could you maybe discuss your fixed versus variable cost, including costs that fall into your cost of goods sold? And how might that change? Or will costs need to ramp up with some of the things you need to do to operate stores now in terms of cleanliness and other safety precautions? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Sure. If you think about our total operating costs, which would include both cost of goods as well as G&A. The vast majority of those are variable costs. If you pull out the merchandise margin line, and just look at the remaining costs, it's roughly about 2/3 fixed and 1/3 variable. In terms of costs that we'll add, as Michael alluded to, we've talked about, there definitely will be additional costs that we will be working into the business, particularly around managing social distancing, additional cleaning tasks as well as significant cost for personal protective equipment. So those will be added to the business as we move forward. And we'll do -- we'll work as aggressively as we can to try to find offsets. We've taken a number of actions to identify cost savings already, and many of those will carry forward. \n But I would expect costs will be a bit elevated related to those other factors. \nMichael Hartshorn: And I would just add that those safety investments are absolutely necessary as we prioritize health and safety for the associates and customers. So we would expect the new protocols to be in place for the foreseeable future. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. \nMatthew Boss: On merchandise margins, as we think about the cadence of the headwind this year, any way to size up or think about the magnitude of second quarter merchandise margin pressure relative to the back half of the year. And maybe just as importantly, what's your confidence in returning to 2019 gross margin levels? Is that a 2021 event? Or over what time frame is that a reasonable assumption to get back to where we were pre-pandemic? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's Michael. On getting back to pre-pandemic, there's just not enough visibility to give you a good answer on that at this point. The second quarter margin is going to be -- it's going to be based on the sell-through in these early days as we reopen the stores. So we'll see how that plays out and have more to report at the end of Q2. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Charles Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: So there's a lot of talk out there about being -- just being one of the best buying opportunities in a long time and Barbara, you spoke to that during your prepared remarks. But there's also some talk in the channel about vendors starting to pack away their own inventory. So I guess I'm just curious if this changes the opportunity set for you? Or do you think it's more of a near-term phenomenon? \nBarbara Rentler: Let me start with there is a lot of merchandise in the market, and it's very broad-based. In terms of vendors saying that they're going to pack away goods, I think the majority of the vendors aren't really in the position to do that, that they really wouldn't have the -- be in the cash position to do it. I think maybe the large vendors can do it. \n But if you take the market in total, I think that's not the majority of people. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: I got a question. The stores haven't been open for very long. So it's hard to get a read probably on how much traffic is going to return and how quickly. But have you done any market research over the last few weeks, trying to figure out how consumers may feel about the off-price shopping experience and the treasure-hunt experience in this world of social distancing. And if you think that they'll feel just as comfortable in your stores when things reopen as they were before the pandemic started? \nBarbara Rentler: Jay, we have seen customer research, maybe more generally, but it's really hard to read. When you have customers sitting at home versus returning, leaving their homes. I think their perspectives are going to be very different over time. And I think they're going to evolve very, very quickly. So it's really hard to rely on that data to make any decisions. I think the country opening very quickly, I think everything is evolving very fast. So it's hard to put a lot of reliance on that data. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Just a couple of questions for me. I think the first one is can you just update us on store opening plans for this year? Just sort of how you're thinking about that, both at Ross and at dd's. And I'd just be curious if this situation has changed your thought process at all? Or if there's any sort of way forward for any e-commerce business at Ross? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On store opening. So as we said in the commentary, in the first quarter, we did add 20 Ross, 7 dd's locations. For the balance of the year, we're not going to open stores in the second quarter based on where we are in the pandemic and based on the uncertainty. And then based on lease obligations and opportunities we have in fall, we're going to open 39 stores. So that's 66 new stores for the year, and that compares to our previous guidance of about 100 stores. \n I'd say beyond that, at this time, we wouldn't comment beyond this year, but we still believe we have the opportunity to grow to 3,000 stores. And then on e-commerce, I'd say our view has not changed at this point. Our focus and efforts are going to be on safely and profitably reopening our bricks-and-mortar stores this year. \nRobert Drbul: Got it. And if I could just ask one more. In terms of like the vendors and your vendor partners, do you think that ones that are talking about packaway, do you think they'll be able -- they'll be good at it? Do you think that they're qualified to make good judgments on packaway? I don't know if you can just maybe give us some perspective on that Barbara. That would be helpful. \nBarbara Rentler: On when the vendor is packing away their own goods? \nRobert Drbul: Yes. Yes. \nBarbara Rentler: Just want to make sure. Listen, just because they haven't done it before, it doesn't mean they won't do it well. I would imagine that they go through and would assess the way we would assess what the mix of their inventory is and what they think can go forward into the next year. And depending upon what type of manufacturer I am, if I have basics, I might think I could carry those forward, but I might not want to carry forward my fashion goods. I would think there's -- be a lot of pieces of it that would be somewhat similar to our thinking in terms of just understanding what you think you can sell when you get to that period because when you're holding goods, it's critical to understand when I go to sell and there if you sell it or us release it, you know it's the right goods at the right time. \n So I would imagine they're putting together a process of how they feel about their assortments and then making a judgment call. But again, I'm not a vendor. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: I guess just on the margins, I think you guys typically do a nice job of breaking down the gross margin line. I mean, at the very least, could you help us on merchandise margin versus store occupancy, merch margin, either including or excluding the write-down? And then Travis, I think you said merch margin pressure should be worse in Q2. And I guess I'm just trying to understand, should merch margins be where should gross margins be? Just -- I know you're not giving guidance, but just a little bit color on the margins, just to make sure we know how to model this out. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. In terms of total operating margin, again, the biggest impacts for the quarter were -- the biggest impact was just the low level of sales. That, combined with the valuation charge really is what drove the overall result. Given the significant deleverage related to sales, the details and the components of that really just aren't very meaningful. And so we don't think it's really relevant to provide that breakdown. \n Your second question is around -- sorry, remind me of your second question? \nIrwin Boruchow: Just, I guess, merchandise margin trajectory, Q2 relative to Q1. \nTravis Marquette: Yes, relative to Q2. Again, it's going to completely depend on what the ultimate sell-through is of the product as we move through the quarter. As I mentioned, what the hit or the impact that we took in Q1 really just related to the below cost portion of those markdowns. And so the rest of the markdowns will be recognized as we sell the product in Q2, depending on how quickly that product sells is going to determine sort of what the ultimate value of the markdowns that we need to take and what gross margin looks like. But there is absolutely a risk that it could be depressed further in Q2. \nMichael Hartshorn: Ike, so in our markdown approach, we'll obviously take a first markdown. And then based on sales, the second markdown. And then we'll be very, very aggressive to liquidate the spring merchandise. So it's going to be highly dependent on how quickly we sell through the merchandise. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: I'm curious when you'll start to -- when you will have to start buying for fall and back to school? And Barbara, how would you -- what are the metrics or the factors that you'll use to decide how deep that buy should be? \nBarbara Rentler: How big the buy will be or just how... \nLaura Champine: Exactly, exactly. \nBarbara Rentler: Just how big? Well, I think whenever you're buying, you're not necessarily buying to the size of the buy, you're buying to what you think you need and/or in our case, if it was a huge deal, we might pack it away. We're going to go into full with very conservative plans. And so we're going to buy -- we're going to control our speed of spending and the rate at which we buy goods since there's so much uncertainty out there. However, if there was a great deal, that we wanted to have, we thought the value was unbelievable and offers a customer a great branded bargain. It wouldn't stop us from making a large deal. But I think it depends. But in terms of the approach to the stores, we're going to go with a conservative plan, and we're going to control what we spend, how much we spend, again, unless something is incredible, and we want to buy it, in which case, part of it might turn out to be a packaway deal or not. But each deal is different. \nLaura Champine: And how much can you delay that buy for this fall? I mean when will you have to make your initial decisions on what to carry for back-to-school, what to buy for back-to-school? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, first of all, we could challenge what back-to-school is going to look like, right? I mean, right now, I'm not sure we even know when schools are going back, if schools are going back, if there's going to be children learning remotely. So I think that's the first question of whether there is a true back-to-school the way we know it, a traditional back-to-school. We're going to buy it as close as we can buy it, the way we normally do because, again, we still have this inventory in front of us that we have to liquidate. We're planning on liquidating. We're planning on getting through. So if I take the continuum, we have to open the stores, get through those goods and then come out and buy new goods for that July, August, September period, based on trend line we'd determine how much we would buy. So there's a lot of factors in there, but we're going into it, thinking it's a very conservative plan because we're not sure. How the customer is going to respond once all the stores are open and is she willing to shop and come back after we get through this huge liquidation period across the whole country. So I think it remains to be seen. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs. \nAlexandra Walvis: My question was on negotiations with landlords. Can you talk about any rent deferrals that you achieved for April and into the second quarter? Will any permanent reductions perhaps be achieved? Or anything that you can share there would be very helpful. \nMichael Hartshorn: Alexandra, it's Michael. Our real estate relationships are obviously critical to the long-term success of the business. Like many other retailers, we are engaging with our landlord partners to negotiate either abatement or deferment of occupancy costs during the period of closure. At this point, we wouldn't get into the specifics at this point because the negotiations are ongoing across our fleet of landlords. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: First, I just wanted to try and clarify some of the language you had on gross margins earlier. So in this quarter, you took a charge of over $300 million, it looks like it's 1,600, 1,700 basis points of an impact to the grosses in the quarter. That was really just the -- you referred to that as a small part of it, Michael. So I want to see -- that's the inventory you estimate you'll be selling below cost, and then as you look to next quarter, we're not talking about an inventory reserve, we're talking about having to put inventory on markdown, I mean, sell it. But are you -- did you mean that, that impact of that could be similar to the order of magnitude of the charge in the first quarter? \n And I'm not really trying to get you to commit to guidance for the company, but to compare this to some of the mainline stores, the department stores who I think that, that component will be as big as the reserve in the first quarter. Is that what you're saying it could be close to that size? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. So again, the portion that we recognize -- let me just kind of take a step back. Again, we are on the cost method of accounting. So typically, markdowns are only recognized in earnings when the product is sold. If the markdown takes the item below cost, then that portion that is below cost gets recognized immediately. So as we assessed our inventory position at the end of the quarter, the portion that we've recognized as of the end of Q1 is just the portion of markdowns that take the product below its original cost. \nMichael Hartshorn: And to be clear, it's what we expect to happen during the second quarter. It's not necessarily markdowns we've already taken below cost. \nTravis Marquette: Correct. Correct. Again, ultimately, the markdowns that we'll recognize in Q2 relate to as the product is sold, it depends on what the markdown is as it goes out the door. And so that's going to depend on the rate of sales. Obviously, we have first markdowns on that product now, depending on rate of sales, we'll take second markdowns and/or third markdowns. And depending on how deep those go that will determine the ultimate markdown impact. \nMichael Hartshorn: But to answer -- a short answer to your question, yes, it could be more than that in the second quarter. \nMichael Binetti: Relative to the dollar, okay. Okay. And then you mentioned some of the new costs related to sanitization and things like that in stores, COVID-related costs, but I'm wondering what are some of the other puts and takes that you see from here, as we back up and just take the aperture out a little bit, you've had a lot of pressure from wage gross that one would argue that with 20% of the country currently unemployed, don't know where that's going, but perhaps that's a little easier going forward. Things like freight and energy have been a pressure obviously, you have a very intense supply chain. Those look like they could be easier. Is there -- I mean do those -- are those big enough to -- those seem like they'd be more than enough to offset anything related to COVID as we roll through the year? \n And then final question, just would love to know how your -- if you could help us think alongside you a little bit on how you will look at reinstating the dividend as you go, what are some of the earmarks you look for along the way? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Let me -- this is Travis. Let me just cover a couple of those. In terms of cost savings, let me go through a couple of things you mentioned. In terms of wage rates, yes, obviously, the economic situation is very different, but it's important to remember that a lot of the wage rate pressure that we would be experiencing going forward relates to statutorily mandated minimum wage increases. And at least as of now, there's been no change in those, particularly California, but there are some other places. \n Again, it's hard to say what's going to happen in the freight markets. Obviously, fuel rates are down, that could be helpful. But it's really hard to speculate exactly what's going to happen in terms of capacity and overall freight rates. So again, there are puts and takes, and it's -- we'll have to see how it plays out. But there's a lot of uncertainty. So we don't exactly know. In terms of reinstating the dividend, again, I think what's critical is that we're going to have to have a much greater visibility on sort of what the sales trend is, what the sustainability of those trends are and factor that in relation to the needs of the business over both the short and the long term. \n And so there are a number of factors that we're going to look at before we would consider reinstating the dividend. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: It's good to hear everybody's voices and glad you all sound okay. Could you just talk a little bit about the store openings? You -- clearly, you've slowed them for this year. I'm curious if you've signed those leases that you intended and are pushing them to next year? Or are those leases that weren't signed yet. And so there's opportunity if you want there to be, maybe at better prices maybe you don't open as many next year. I'm just curious where your thoughts are on that and how easy it was to push those -- push that number down to the 66? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the openings this year, we made the decision not only on the lease obligations, but the cash to open the store. Many of those will get pushed into next year. And then as we get a better view of what the post-trend opening is as we move through the year, we'll certainly make pause on new leases that we'll sign for next year. But wouldn't comment further on how many stores that could be for next year at this point in time. \nMarni Shapiro: That makes sense. And then just 1 follow-up. Barbara, you talked about somebody asked about packaways and how the big -- how companies would do this. And I guess my follow-up there is, you do work with a lot of small and medium vendors, the ones that supply all the department stores, and we don't -- they're not publicly traded, and not everybody knows of them. Are you -- I guess, how are you working with these guys? They've been partners with you for a very long time. I'm curious how your relationship with those vendors are because some of them could be in very tenuous shape given all the cancellations, not just from you guys, but across all of retail? \nBarbara Rentler: Marni, I mean, obviously, we're working with all our vendors. The buyers haven't been buying. They've been keeping close relationships. And when we go back out into the marketplace, we'll obviously shop all those same people we've been shopping and doing business with for years and then see what opportunities are out there. I mean... \nMarni Shapiro: Right. Yes. I guess what else is there to do unless you're going to buy them and make them part of Ross Stores. Best of luck of opening everything. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think of the measure of fixed and variable expenses, with the thought of reopening and whether it's more limited hours or obviously the extra sanitation and treatment that's needed within a store to operate. How do you think about some of the expenses coming back into the fold? Do you need as much store staff as you had before? And with the combination of what you may be able to do on rents, is there an opportunity for a lower expense structure going forward in terms of how you're thinking about it? \nTravis Marquette: Dana, I think it's going to be difficult, at least as the world looks today to drive expenses significantly lower. Obviously, as we pull -- we are pulling back where we can. If I think about the store environment, we do have shorter hours that reduces cost to some extent. But we've always managed our stores pretty specifically to the sort of payroll demand by the stores. So there's not a lot of just blanket hours that we hand out. And so as we -- are we reopening and we need to take into account additional labor to manage social distancing, to complete cleaning tasks and other things. Again, that's going to have an impact on sort of overall cost for the stores. \n So clearly, though, we are continuing to evaluate our total P&L, and we are continuing to look, even though we've taken a number of actions already to reduce costs. We continue to and will continue to evaluate where we can find savings across the P&L. \nDana Telsey: And then is there any difference on the dd side in terms of getting operations back up and running as compared to the Ross Stores side, whether in terms of payroll or occupancy? \n And is there more occupancy in dd's to manage rent costs than there is in Ross? Or is it not different at all? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. Dana, it's very similar across both chains. I wouldn't say there were significant differences. \nOperator: Your next question comes from John Kernan from Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Most of them have been answered. Just curious, can you tell us what percent of your store base you expect to have open by the end of May? And then what you are anticipating to have open by the end of the quarter in July? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On openings, I wouldn't tell you specifically May, but we're ready to open stores when the state of the pandemic allows us to do so and when the government allows us to do so. So that's out of our control of when that -- when the openings will actually happen. Our expectation, though, based on what we're monitoring that could change is that we'd have the chain open by the end of June. \nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Jamie Merriman from Bernstein. \nJamie Merriman: My question, Barbara, is just on the vendor base. And whether you see this as an opportunity to grow the vendor base and whether -- I understand that the buyers aren't currently buying in the market, but if they're pursuing new relationships, new opportunities on that front? And then just with your existing vendors, whether orders needed to be canceled and more payments extended during the quarter? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of growing the vendor base, there's an opportunity for us to continue to open new resources, especially now, some people are a little bit more flexible as business has gotten a little bit more difficult. And the merchants are always trying to open new resources. So whether we're buying or not, still calling people, still trying to build relationships, still trying to move the business forward. Just say the second part of your question, again, about existing vendors? \nJamie Merriman: Whether you had to cancel orders and extend payment terms during the quarter just from a liquidity perspective? \nBarbara Rentler: Initially, we did cancel some orders in the beginning of the quarter when we first took action on what was going on when the pandemic started. But that's very similar to what other retailers did. So we took the actions that we thought were necessary at that time to position us. And then after that, we feel that we'll continue to remain engaged with the vendors we have relationships with now as we come back, but we definitely took actions the way other retailers took actions to get ourselves positioned in a better position so we can manage our way through this very unprecedented situation. So as we come back into the market, we'll be coming back and working with vendors again. \nOperator: And I will now turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today. Our thoughts go out to all of you and your families for your continued health and safety. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with an update on the current status of the company's operations, including our store reopening plans, followed by a review of our first quarter performance and details of our financial position entering the second quarter. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As a reminder, all store and distribution center locations were closed from March 20 through the quarter end to help prevent the ongoing spread of the coronavirus. Further, our corporate and buying offices were also closed with most associates continuing to work remotely. With the closure of our retail operations, we made the difficult but necessary decision to temporarily furlough the majority of our store and distribution center associates as well as some other employees across the business effective April 5. \n More recently, on May 14, we began a phased process of reopening stores on a market-by-market basis. This followed a careful review of current guidance from health officials and advisers as well as federal, state and local governments. Approximately 700 stores have reopened, since with the remaining stores expected to be reopened over the coming weeks. Our top priority will always be the health and well-being of our associates and customers, and we will only reopen stores when it is safe to do so. \n Further, the state of the pandemic remains very dynamic, and these plans could change materially as we cautiously move forward. As we restart operations, we are implementing a variety of measures with the goal of keeping our associates, customers and the communities we serve, safe. These measures will include additional cleaning and sanitation of stores and workspaces, providing associates with personal protective equipment based on CDC or other health guidelines and implementing physical distancing practices. \n We will also be reopening and ramping up our distribution center network in the coming weeks. In addition, we expect to reopen our corporate and buying offices in the coming months. As with our stores, we are putting in place additional health and safety measures across all areas of these facilities. \n Turning now to our financials. As noted in today's press release, our first quarter results reflect the unprecedented impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business which led to the closure of all stores from March 20 through the end of the quarter and of our first quarterly loss in more than 30 years. Total sales for the quarter were $1.8 billion, down from $3.8 billion in the prior year. Given that stores were open for less than 7 weeks of the 13-week period, the comparable store sales metric is not meaningful for the quarter. For the 13 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we incurred a loss per share of $0.87 versus earnings per share of $1.15 for the same period last year. \n The net loss for the period was $306 million versus net income of $421 million last year. In addition to the significant negative impact due to the lack of revenue from the closure of all stores beginning March 20, our operating loss also includes a onetime noncash inventory valuation charge relating to the portion of the inventory that we now expect to sell below our original cost. As we ended the quarter, total consolidated inventories, net of this valuation charge were down 3% over the prior year with packaway levels at 42% of the total compared to last year's 44%. \n Average in-store inventories were up 1% at quarter end versus the same period last year. Turning to store growth. We opened 20 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter and ended the period with 1,832 total stores. Given the significant uncertainty of consumer behavior and shopping patterns as stores reopen, we will not open new stores in the current quarter and now expect to open about 39 stores this fall for a total of 66 new stores for the full year. \n Now Travis Marquette will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our financial position entering the second quarter. Thank you, Travis. We want to reiterate that given the extraordinary global health crisis created by COVID-19, the safety and wellbeing of our associates and customers will always be of the utmost important to us. Considering the uncertainty on how this health crisis could impact consumers, we believe it is prudent to take a conservative approach to managing our business. \n Looking ahead, I want to emphasize that we have a deep bench of proven and experienced leaders throughout the business. And as Travis noted, a very strong financial foundation. We also see significant opportunities in the marketplace to acquire some of the best brands ever -- bargains ever. Longer term, we remain well positioned in the off-price sector and believe consumers will continue to favor retailers focused on delivering both value and convenience, all this makes us confidence in our ability to successfully navigate through these challenging times. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. And in terms of fresh inventory in the stores, obviously, we're just first opening our stores now and trying to liquidate the goods that are in the stores and also the goods that were in process outside the DCs and in the DCs. So we need to first work through that. The merchants have not been actively buying in the marketplace. They've been staying very close to their vendors. And after we understand a little bit more about what sales and sell-throughs can look like, we will go back into the market, I would say, with a very surgical lens of what it is we need and what we can understand of what we think the customer wants. Sure. Category opportunity. First, I think we have to see as we sell through our inventory, what the customer is voting for, whether it's apparel or home. The home business overall has had a trend for a long period of time, one would expect that home, go forward, would still be a good category, especially as people are kind of home nesting and buying things that perhaps they normally might buy. But with that, it will really depend on what the opportunities are out there in both apparel and in home. We see a lot of goods out there. We're anticipating that there'll be a lot of great closeouts and branded bargains for the customer. So I don't want to put sides around saying it's one business versus the other. I think in this environment, a lot of the deals may dictate where the sales would come from. And just in terms of just the thought process around buying packaway, I'm assuming you may pack away that I could release earlier than packaway that it might not release till March of next year. Is that really your question? I think it depends on what the product is, right? So in some classifications of product, there'll be goods that would be appropriate sooner than later. And in some products, some classifications, you would really have to hold it until the spring season, if it's truly spring product. So it varies based off of the classification and the gender, the timing, the whole thing. But there's a lot of product out there in total. So I would say there's a lot of choices, some of which probably could flow a little sooner. And then in terms of a comparison to 2008, I think the current retail environment is different. Obviously, this crisis is much worse. We're expecting the recovery to be much slower. During the financial crisis, we didn't have to close stores. We didn't have to navigate through health and safety mandates, shelter in place, social distancing. So we think this is very different, and we think it will be a slow recovery on our way back. In terms of Penney's and bankruptcies, there's been a lot of bankruptcies I think long term, the way for us to think about it is that there's an opportunity for market share, particularly in the moderate portion of the business. Let me start with there is a lot of merchandise in the market, and it's very broad-based. In terms of vendors saying that they're going to pack away goods, I think the majority of the vendors aren't really in the position to do that, that they really wouldn't have the -- be in the cash position to do it. I think maybe the large vendors can do it. \n But if you take the market in total, I think that's not the majority of people. Jay, we have seen customer research, maybe more generally, but it's really hard to read. When you have customers sitting at home versus returning, leaving their homes. I think their perspectives are going to be very different over time. And I think they're going to evolve very, very quickly. So it's really hard to rely on that data to make any decisions. I think the country opening very quickly, I think everything is evolving very fast. So it's hard to put a lot of reliance on that data. On when the vendor is packing away their own goods? Just want to make sure. Listen, just because they haven't done it before, it doesn't mean they won't do it well. I would imagine that they go through and would assess the way we would assess what the mix of their inventory is and what they think can go forward into the next year. And depending upon what type of manufacturer I am, if I have basics, I might think I could carry those forward, but I might not want to carry forward my fashion goods. I would think there's -- be a lot of pieces of it that would be somewhat similar to our thinking in terms of just understanding what you think you can sell when you get to that period because when you're holding goods, it's critical to understand when I go to sell and there if you sell it or us release it, you know it's the right goods at the right time. \n So I would imagine they're putting together a process of how they feel about their assortments and then making a judgment call. But again, I'm not a vendor. How big the buy will be or just how... Just how big? Well, I think whenever you're buying, you're not necessarily buying to the size of the buy, you're buying to what you think you need and/or in our case, if it was a huge deal, we might pack it away. We're going to go into full with very conservative plans. And so we're going to buy -- we're going to control our speed of spending and the rate at which we buy goods since there's so much uncertainty out there. However, if there was a great deal, that we wanted to have, we thought the value was unbelievable and offers a customer a great branded bargain. It wouldn't stop us from making a large deal. But I think it depends. But in terms of the approach to the stores, we're going to go with a conservative plan, and we're going to control what we spend, how much we spend, again, unless something is incredible, and we want to buy it, in which case, part of it might turn out to be a packaway deal or not. But each deal is different. Well, first of all, we could challenge what back-to-school is going to look like, right? I mean, right now, I'm not sure we even know when schools are going back, if schools are going back, if there's going to be children learning remotely. So I think that's the first question of whether there is a true back-to-school the way we know it, a traditional back-to-school. We're going to buy it as close as we can buy it, the way we normally do because, again, we still have this inventory in front of us that we have to liquidate. We're planning on liquidating. We're planning on getting through. So if I take the continuum, we have to open the stores, get through those goods and then come out and buy new goods for that July, August, September period, based on trend line we'd determine how much we would buy. So there's a lot of factors in there, but we're going into it, thinking it's a very conservative plan because we're not sure. How the customer is going to respond once all the stores are open and is she willing to shop and come back after we get through this huge liquidation period across the whole country. So I think it remains to be seen. Marni, I mean, obviously, we're working with all our vendors. The buyers haven't been buying. They've been keeping close relationships. And when we go back out into the marketplace, we'll obviously shop all those same people we've been shopping and doing business with for years and then see what opportunities are out there. I mean... Sure. In terms of growing the vendor base, there's an opportunity for us to continue to open new resources, especially now, some people are a little bit more flexible as business has gotten a little bit more difficult. And the merchants are always trying to open new resources. So whether we're buying or not, still calling people, still trying to build relationships, still trying to move the business forward. Just say the second part of your question, again, about existing vendors? Initially, we did cancel some orders in the beginning of the quarter when we first took action on what was going on when the pandemic started. But that's very similar to what other retailers did. So we took the actions that we thought were necessary at that time to position us. And then after that, we feel that we'll continue to remain engaged with the vendors we have relationships with now as we come back, but we definitely took actions the way other retailers took actions to get ourselves positioned in a better position so we can manage our way through this very unprecedented situation. So as we come back into the market, we'll be coming back and working with vendors again. Thank you for joining us today. Our thoughts go out to all of you and your families for your continued health and safety."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Hi, Lorraine, it's Michael Hartshorn. Stores for us have been reopened less than a week. So we wouldn't provide commentary at this point. Beyond the initial openings though, as Travis talked about in his commentary, there's a number of factors that will impact consumer demand post opening, including the economy on the backside of commerce reopening, changes to customer behaviors, impact of social distancing and certainly, the competitive environment among others. So at this point, we can't predict what's going to happen after we reopen the stores for the remainder of the year. We do believe, though, there'll be a negative impact on consumer demand throughout the remainder of the year. On the speed, Tracy, on the speed, we can flow inventory from packaway very quickly, a matter of days through the DC and a matter of a week or 2 into the stores. Kimberly, on the distribution centers, we have management teams in all of our distribution centers and are ramping -- preparing to ramp up production, and that includes California, the Carolinas and also in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. So we're ready to start the DCs. In South Carolina, we've already started production and prepared to start backfilling stores as they need. Kimberly, on pace, our goal is to move through it in the second quarter. And we're going to operate the business very, very cautiously, both inventory, sales, expenses, capital, and we're going to put ourselves in a position of strength so that we can chase the business, leverage expenses. So we would expect inventory to be down at the end of the second quarter. Sure. We wouldn't comment on basket size. Again, the stores have been only opened a week. Obviously, there's local regulations on how to meter in and out of the stores. We have security at the front of each store that's metering based on those predetermined occupancy limits, in most cases, we're below -- even below metering than what the restrictions require to make sure we keep customers and associates safe. \n We have included payroll to make sure that we're keeping safe distances and trying to move people through the registers as appropriate. And I would just add that those safety investments are absolutely necessary as we prioritize health and safety for the associates and customers. So we would expect the new protocols to be in place for the foreseeable future. It's Michael. On getting back to pre-pandemic, there's just not enough visibility to give you a good answer on that at this point. The second quarter margin is going to be -- it's going to be based on the sell-through in these early days as we reopen the stores. So we'll see how that plays out and have more to report at the end of Q2. Sure. On store opening. So as we said in the commentary, in the first quarter, we did add 20 Ross, 7 dd's locations. For the balance of the year, we're not going to open stores in the second quarter based on where we are in the pandemic and based on the uncertainty. And then based on lease obligations and opportunities we have in fall, we're going to open 39 stores. So that's 66 new stores for the year, and that compares to our previous guidance of about 100 stores. \n I'd say beyond that, at this time, we wouldn't comment beyond this year, but we still believe we have the opportunity to grow to 3,000 stores. And then on e-commerce, I'd say our view has not changed at this point. Our focus and efforts are going to be on safely and profitably reopening our bricks-and-mortar stores this year. Ike, so in our markdown approach, we'll obviously take a first markdown. And then based on sales, the second markdown. And then we'll be very, very aggressive to liquidate the spring merchandise. So it's going to be highly dependent on how quickly we sell through the merchandise. Alexandra, it's Michael. Our real estate relationships are obviously critical to the long-term success of the business. Like many other retailers, we are engaging with our landlord partners to negotiate either abatement or deferment of occupancy costs during the period of closure. At this point, we wouldn't get into the specifics at this point because the negotiations are ongoing across our fleet of landlords. And to be clear, it's what we expect to happen during the second quarter. It's not necessarily markdowns we've already taken below cost. But to answer -- a short answer to your question, yes, it could be more than that in the second quarter. Sure. On the openings this year, we made the decision not only on the lease obligations, but the cash to open the store. Many of those will get pushed into next year. And then as we get a better view of what the post-trend opening is as we move through the year, we'll certainly make pause on new leases that we'll sign for next year. But wouldn't comment further on how many stores that could be for next year at this point in time. Yes. Dana, it's very similar across both chains. I wouldn't say there were significant differences. Sure. On openings, I wouldn't tell you specifically May, but we're ready to open stores when the state of the pandemic allows us to do so and when the government allows us to do so. So that's out of our control of when that -- when the openings will actually happen. Our expectation, though, based on what we're monitoring that could change is that we'd have the chain open by the end of June."

            "name": "Travis Marquette",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As Barbara mentioned earlier, we reported a net loss of $306 million or $0.87 per share for the first quarter. Operating margin for the period reflects the impact of the significant revenue decline from our store closures as well as a onetime noncash inventory valuation charge of $313 million or $0.58 per share. \n As a reminder, we are on the lower of cost or net realizable value method of accounting for inventory, which provides that most markdowns are recognized when inventory is sold unless the markdown takes the item's value below costs. The onetime valuation charge in the first quarter reflects our estimate of inventory that we expect to sell below cost in the coming months. This first quarter reserve, therefore, reflects only a small portion of the total markdowns, we believe will be necessary to sell through the existing spring inventory. We expect that the vast majority of markdown activity will occur in the second quarter. It is important to note that the ultimate impact of these markdowns will depend on the pace of sell-through as we move through the quarter. \n Now let's discuss our current financial position and balance sheet. As noted in our press release, in response to the severe economic disruption created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we quickly took decisive actions to increase our liquidity and financial flexibility. These included drawing down $800 million under our existing revolving credit facility, completing a $2 billion senior unsecured public bond offering and obtaining a new undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. As previously announced, we suspended our stock repurchase program on March 19. Before doing so, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of about $132 million. We have no plans to repurchase shares for the remainder of the year. In addition, we also announced today the suspension of our quarterly dividend payments. We are also aggressively cutting costs throughout the company by minimizing nonbusiness critical operating expenses, rightsizing our merchandise receipt and inventory plans and reducing capital expenditures to further enhance our liquidity. \n Capital expenditures for this year are now projected to be approximately $420 million, down from our initial guidance of $730 million. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with over $3 billion in liquidity, which includes an ending unrestricted cash balance of about $2.7 billion and the new $500 million revolver. As Barbara mentioned earlier, we are in the early stages of resuming operations by reopening groups of stores as it becomes safe to do so over the coming weeks. \n However, we have no visibility on how quickly consumer demand will recover and the impact this will have on store traffic. Given these unknowns, we are not providing second quarter sales and earnings guidance or an updated annual fiscal 2020 outlook at this time. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes. In terms of inventory, again, given the fact that our stores were closed for 2 months, we do have a substantial amount of aged seasonal goods. Again, with the abrupt closure of the stores and the significant broad-based decline and trends leading immediately preceding the stores, again, inventories were misaligned. So in that light, we reviewed our inventory position and assessed the markdown risk that we had. And have recorded in the first quarter, the portion of markdowns that we believe will be below cost. In terms of ultimately what the sell-through and how long it will take to move through those, again, it really depends. We don't have a crystal ball. We don't know how quickly the consumer will return to our stores. As Michael mentioned, there's a lot of economic factors that will influence that. \n And ultimately, as I mentioned, the impact of the markdowns will depend on what that rate of sell-through is as we move through the quarter. In terms of in-store inventory turns, again, if you just focus on in-store only, our turns are quite quick. I don't think we've quantified that specifically in the past, but it would be significantly faster than if you're just trying to look at the total inventory metric on the balance sheet. Sure. As we talked about previously, sales trends were above plan in February, and we felt good about sales up until early March when, I think, as we talked about, there was a very rapid deceleration just prior to when we closed our stores on March 20. Yes. Sure. If you think about our total operating costs, which would include both cost of goods as well as G&A. The vast majority of those are variable costs. If you pull out the merchandise margin line, and just look at the remaining costs, it's roughly about 2/3 fixed and 1/3 variable. In terms of costs that we'll add, as Michael alluded to, we've talked about, there definitely will be additional costs that we will be working into the business, particularly around managing social distancing, additional cleaning tasks as well as significant cost for personal protective equipment. So those will be added to the business as we move forward. And we'll do -- we'll work as aggressively as we can to try to find offsets. We've taken a number of actions to identify cost savings already, and many of those will carry forward. \n But I would expect costs will be a bit elevated related to those other factors. Yes. In terms of total operating margin, again, the biggest impacts for the quarter were -- the biggest impact was just the low level of sales. That, combined with the valuation charge really is what drove the overall result. Given the significant deleverage related to sales, the details and the components of that really just aren't very meaningful. And so we don't think it's really relevant to provide that breakdown. \n Your second question is around -- sorry, remind me of your second question? Yes, relative to Q2. Again, it's going to completely depend on what the ultimate sell-through is of the product as we move through the quarter. As I mentioned, what the hit or the impact that we took in Q1 really just related to the below cost portion of those markdowns. And so the rest of the markdowns will be recognized as we sell the product in Q2, depending on how quickly that product sells is going to determine sort of what the ultimate value of the markdowns that we need to take and what gross margin looks like. But there is absolutely a risk that it could be depressed further in Q2. Yes. So again, the portion that we recognize -- let me just kind of take a step back. Again, we are on the cost method of accounting. So typically, markdowns are only recognized in earnings when the product is sold. If the markdown takes the item below cost, then that portion that is below cost gets recognized immediately. So as we assessed our inventory position at the end of the quarter, the portion that we've recognized as of the end of Q1 is just the portion of markdowns that take the product below its original cost. Correct. Correct. Again, ultimately, the markdowns that we'll recognize in Q2 relate to as the product is sold, it depends on what the markdown is as it goes out the door. And so that's going to depend on the rate of sales. Obviously, we have first markdowns on that product now, depending on rate of sales, we'll take second markdowns and/or third markdowns. And depending on how deep those go that will determine the ultimate markdown impact. Yes. Let me -- this is Travis. Let me just cover a couple of those. In terms of cost savings, let me go through a couple of things you mentioned. In terms of wage rates, yes, obviously, the economic situation is very different, but it's important to remember that a lot of the wage rate pressure that we would be experiencing going forward relates to statutorily mandated minimum wage increases. And at least as of now, there's been no change in those, particularly California, but there are some other places. \n Again, it's hard to say what's going to happen in the freight markets. Obviously, fuel rates are down, that could be helpful. But it's really hard to speculate exactly what's going to happen in terms of capacity and overall freight rates. So again, there are puts and takes, and it's -- we'll have to see how it plays out. But there's a lot of uncertainty. So we don't exactly know. In terms of reinstating the dividend, again, I think what's critical is that we're going to have to have a much greater visibility on sort of what the sales trend is, what the sustainability of those trends are and factor that in relation to the needs of the business over both the short and the long term. \n And so there are a number of factors that we're going to look at before we would consider reinstating the dividend. Dana, I think it's going to be difficult, at least as the world looks today to drive expenses significantly lower. Obviously, as we pull -- we are pulling back where we can. If I think about the store environment, we do have shorter hours that reduces cost to some extent. But we've always managed our stores pretty specifically to the sort of payroll demand by the stores. So there's not a lot of just blanket hours that we hand out. And so as we -- are we reopening and we need to take into account additional labor to manage social distancing, to complete cleaning tasks and other things. Again, that's going to have an impact on sort of overall cost for the stores. \n So clearly, though, we are continuing to evaluate our total P&L, and we are continuing to look, even though we've taken a number of actions already to reduce costs. We continue to and will continue to evaluate where we can find savings across the P&L."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, COVID-related costs and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2020 Form 10-K and fiscal 2021 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n Now I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betty Chen, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2021 performance, followed by our outlook for '22 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we achieved strong sales results in the fourth quarter despite the negative impact from both the surge in Omicron cases during the peak holiday selling period and continued supply chain congestion. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022, were $1.04 on net income of $367 million. This compared to $1.28 per share on net earnings of $456 million for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2020. \n Total sales for the fourth quarter were $5 billion with comparable store sales up 9% versus the same period in 2019. For the 2021 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.87 on net income of $1.723 billion, up from $4.60 per share on net earnings of $1.661 billion in 2019. Total sales for 2021 rose 18% to $18.9 billion with comparable store sales up 13%. \n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling period, the best performing larger merchandise areas were children's and men's, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained solid during the period. However, their profitability was also negatively impacted by cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID. \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 23% versus 2019, mainly from an increase in in-transit merchandise due to longer lead times from the industry-wide supply chain bottlenecks. Average store inventories were down slightly versus 2019, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories versus 46% 2 years ago. \n As noted in today's release, we are pleased to report that our Board recently authorized a new 2-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2023. This authorization replaces the $850 million remaining under the prior buyback we announced in May of last year. A total of $650 million of common stock was repurchased under the previous program in fiscal 2021. \n The Board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.31 per share to be payable on March 31, 2022, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2022. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend program reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2022. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales increased 9% for the quarter. This gain was driven by growth in the size of the average basket, partially offset by a decline in transactions. Fourth quarter operating margin of 9.8% was down 350 basis points from 13.3% in 2019, mainly due to ongoing expense headwinds. Cost of goods sold increased 210 basis points due to a combination of factors. Domestic freight rose 100 basis points, and distribution costs increased 70 basis points, primarily due to the previously mentioned supply chain challenges, in addition to higher wages. Merchandise margin declined 50 basis points due to higher ocean freight costs, while buying expenses grew 20 basis points. Occupancy levered 30 basis points on higher sales volume. SG&A for the period rose 140 basis points, again, due to pressure from the holiday-related pay incentives, plus higher wages and COVID costs. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately 35 basis points with a higher impact to SG&A than cost of goods sold. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2022. As Barbara noted in our press release, 2022 is a difficult year to predict for numerous reasons. We are up against last year's record government stimulus and the lifting of COVID restrictions that led to unprecedented consumer demand, which fueled extraordinary sales gains in the spring of 2021. In addition, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain headwinds as well as external risks from the effects of inflation, both on consumer demand and on costs within our business. As a result, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 28, 2023, are planned to be flat to up 3% versus a 13% gain in 2021. \n Earnings per share for 2022 are projected to be $4.71 to $5.12 compared to $4.87 in 2021. This reflects our expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the year given the substantial cost increases we incurred in the fall of 2021. Our guidance assumptions for the 2022 year include total sales are forecast to grow by 2% to 6%. We plan to return to our more normal opening cadence of 100 new locations in 2022 comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, we expect to close about 10 older stores. \n Operating margin for the full year is planned to be in the 11.6% to 12.1% range, down slightly from 2021 due to deleveraging on lower same-store sales gains, and again, ongoing expense headwinds, especially in the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is estimated to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $560 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 348 million. \n In addition, capital expenditures for 2022 are planned to be approximately $800 million. This outlay will fund further investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth and in technology to increase efficiencies throughout the business in order to maximize our prospects to capture profitable market share going forward. \n Let's now turn to our guidance for the first quarter. In addition to the aforementioned stimulus benefits and strong pent-up demand early last year, we also faced larger headwinds from higher freight and wage costs early in the year. As a result, we are forecasting comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending April 30, 2022, to be down 2% to down 4% on top of a 13% gain for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Earnings per share for the 2022 first quarter are projected to be $0.93 to $0.99 versus $1.34 in the prior year period. \n The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance includes the following: Total sales are forecast to be down 2% to up 1% versus last year's first quarter. We plan to add 30 new stores, consisting of 22 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. We project first quarter operating margin to be 10.2% to 10.6% compared to 14.2% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect from the negative same-store sales assumption as well as ongoing expense pressure from freight and wage costs early in the year. Net interest expense is estimated to be $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, and diluted shares are forecast to be about $350 million. \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. As mentioned in our press release, given consumers' increased focus on value and convenience, we have seen favorable sales trends in both our new and infill market stores. As a result, along with the large number of retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years, we now believe that Ross Dress for Less can expand to about 2,900 locations, up from our prior target of 2,400 and that dd's DISCOUNTS can eventually become a chain of approximately 700 stores versus our previous projection of 600. This represents an overall 20% increase in our forecasted potential to 3,600 stores, providing substantial runway for expansion relative to our year-end store count of 1,923 locations. \n We operate in attractive sector of retail, and our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. Looking at 2023 and beyond, we are targeting a return to double-digit earnings per growth driven by a combination of same-store sales gains, operating margin, improvement accelerated new store openings and our ongoing stock repurchase program. \n In closing, we especially want to thank our approximately 100,000 talented associates throughout the company whose dedication has enabled us to successfully navigate through the unprecedented challenges of the past 2 years. We believe their continued efforts will enable us to capitalize on our opportunities for future sales and earnings growth while also delivering strong returns to stockholders over the coming years. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. I wanted to just ask about the guidance here for Q1 and if you have seen perhaps a better start to the quarter, better -- expecting deceleration as we get through the stimulus lap. I'm just wondering how you're planning the quarter. \n And then if I could just sneak one more in, I just wanted to ask Barbara about what you're seeing in terms of inventory availability in the market and whether you have been able to capitalize on perhaps some of the supply chain volatility that's causing late deliveries elsewhere. \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, I'll start with the first quarter guidance, it's Michael Hartshorn. The first quarter last year, we saw a significant acceleration in March and April last year. As a reminder, the government stimulus hit in the -- started being disbursed to taxpayers in the third week. So that -- we're planning around that with our guidance. We had a slower start to the year last year and then had a significant acceleration as we move through the quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And then as it pertains, Kimberly, to availability, there is definitely availability. But what I would say is it's not consistent across all merchandise departments and classifications. As goods come in from the supply chain congestion and there's issues, it's not always as broad-based in every business. But with that, yes, I would say we've been able to capitalize on the volatility in the supply chain, just given our increase in packaway, how much it's gone up in the last few months. And we see more potential opportunities in front of us from closeout -- there's a lot of that merchandise that vendors are still moving is not necessarily even in the country. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: So with the inflationary backdrop getting tougher, I was hoping you could give us some perspective on how your customer has responded to the inflation in the past. And as you're planning for the spring season, how are you thinking about the share gain opportunity as consumers seek value versus the risk of a near-term pullback in spending as consumers digest some of the price hikes in Essentials categories? \nMichael Hartshorn: Obviously, we don't have -- it's been 40 years since the U.S. has seen this type of inflation, so we don't have a ton of experience on how the customer will react. So I'd be speculating as inflation appears at this point to be with us for a while, in general, I'd say the consumer seems to be healthy coming into the year, given higher wages and savings. But obviously, with this level of inflation throughout the economy, they're going to have to make choices how and where they spend their money, and it's highly likely the consumer will be seeking value, and that would be positive for us. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great, and congrats on the next quarter. So Barbara, maybe could you elaborate on the behavioral changes that you cited tied to value and convenience, when you saw this potentially accelerate, how you think the model is positioned? And then just on the profitability front, as you cited in 2023 and moving forward, operating margin improvement, help us to think about the drivers of that as we think about the return to double-digit earnings growth annually going forward? \nMichael Hartshorn: Let me -- on the way we're thinking about this year, I'll just go through the components of expenses and then talk through the long-term model. Overall, like everyone in the U.S. economy, we're seeing cost inflation throughout the business. For us, it's most acutely felt in transportation, both domestic and ocean freight markets and also on the wage front. In those 3 areas, we have a very good line of sight on ocean freight and we know that they will remain elevated through 2022. \n On the domestic freight, we don't expect the same type of headwinds on core domestic freight, although we do expect, especially with the current geopolitics, we do expect volatility in fuel-related costs. And then on wages with low unemployment rates, the overall labor market continues to be very tight, although the warehousing labor market has been the most competitive over the last year. All that said, we believe we're well positioned to start the year, especially given the wage actions we took in the back half of 2021. \n On the long-term model, given our market share opportunity with the consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience and given the fact that we're facing less brick-and-mortar competition, we believe we have a market share opportunity going forward. So looking into 2023, we're -- as you mentioned, we're targeting double-digit earnings per share growth. And the model or the formula looks very similar to what it looked like prior to the pandemic, and that's a combination of new store growth around 5%, comp sales of 3% to 4% with EBIT margin expansion at the high end of that range. And with the stock repurchase program, that adds up to the double-digit EPS growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Earlier today, Cole spoke to an improving traffic picture in the month of February and also noted that they've begun to see some trade down in certain categories, suggesting that the focus on value that you guys are suggesting has actually already started to begun. So I'm just curious if you've seen that thus far and how it bodes for the balance of the year. \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't comment on inter-quarter trends for us. Obviously, the latest information we can talk about is in January, what we did see during the quarter, as Omicron spiked, surged right before Christmas, we did see a falloff on traffic, but the customer with their fewer trips bought more per transaction as we progressed through the remainder of the quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And the focus on value, our customer has always been focused on value. But as the world is evolving and the inflation, we actually feel we have an opportunity to gain a trade-down customer at the same time. So value has always been critical for us, and it's something the merchants are constantly watching and evaluating, especially as retails have gone up in the outside world, understanding where our price value relationship is with everything. So value is critical to us always, and it'll just be more important go forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Just following up on that. You had discussed last quarter some limited pricing actions in certain categories. Can you update us on the success of that and if you plan to continue to broaden that out through more of the store? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. We have put in a strategic process where we actually go in and the buyers are constantly assessing the market to understand pricing and where there were there potentially opportunities to increase that pricing. And we started that last quarter, and it continued through this quarter. And the average price per SKU was up somewhat during the quarter. The way we're looking at it is we've had successes in many areas now compared to where we were, and we are watching it and evaluating it and I would say being cautious about moving the needle based off of where we sit in the food chain. So we're evolving and testing in certain commodities -- not even testing, buying it in certain commodities where it's been successful. \n But I think the most important thing for us to remember is that value to our customer, the real definition for her is the appropriate separation of price between ourselves and mainstream retail. So we'll continue to do that, and we'll watch things as they evolve and move on from there. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Just to follow that a little bit, I mean, it does seem like -- I know, at first, you're fairly resistant to talking about AUR increases. But I guess, 2 quarters has gone by now, and the rest of the world is going to be taking some pretty meaningful price increases. I mean, do you see the opportunity improving versus where you were 1 and 2 quarters ago as far as the ability to take price? And I guess also, as you look through the store, are you starting to see any evidence of a new customer coming in that would point to evidence to you of a trade down? \n I know during the great recession, it was a long time ago now, but I know you guys benefited from a lot of customers coming in from channels like department store and specialty apparel. Wondering if you're seeing any evidence like that of -- among the new customers coming in. \nBarbara Rentler: Well, Michael, first, let's talk about the pricing. So right, for the last 2 quarters, we've really been watching it. We've got a process in place. We are watching the retails move in our competition and all types of competition because the merchants are studying that and where we think we have that opportunity, and we can still offer unbelievable value to the customer, we're taking it. If we don't feel like we can offer that value to her at this point, we're not taking it. \n What I would also say is, it's kind of hard to predict where mainstream retailers will be in the future and what they're going to do because prices can go up and go up and go up, and they might go up until they don't work at some point. And a traditional retailer can POS in any moment in time. \n So we are trying to really manage our way through giving the customer great value, increasing the AUR where it's appropriate and really making sure that we balance through where the future could go in terms of potential POS-ing at some point in time. So -- there's a lot of variables, which is why we have processes in place, and we're doing it strategically. But where we have done it strategically and continue to offer value to the customer, great values, it is working. \n And in terms of understanding of the trade-down customer, I think it's kind of hard to see if you're asking from specific types of products or retails. I wouldn't say we've seen anything specific along those lines to say that we're getting a trade-down customer at this point. But with inflation continuing, one would think that, that would be a logical conclusion that over time that we could potentially pick up additional market share. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: I have just a quick follow-up on the pricing question again, I'm sorry. But are you able to take prices up at dd's? I know those prices tend to be a little bit lower and the customer a little bit more sensitive. \n And then if you could also just talk about past this year kind of longer term, you said there's a change out there in bricks-and-mortar, fewer competitors, potentially meaning a healthier retail environment in general. So is there an opportunity for you guys to push up the food chain a little bit with some better brands and some changes to the assortment just a little bit, especially at Ross Stores? \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. So 2 things. So at dd's, we have -- the customer is absolutely price sensitive and has lower price points -- but in duties, we're running the same process we're doing at Ross, we're studying it. The merchants are understanding it, they're understanding values because a lot of the competition for dd's is mass market, and a lot of those retails have gone up. And so we're running the same process in both companies to make sure that we have real sizes around it, we can understand it and make the right decisions. And dd's also had success in some areas where they have tried it. So I would say both companies, it's kind of -- it's an ongoing process, and it will be the same process that will continue. \n In terms of longer, you're saying an assortment strategy, could we trade up into more better brands? Look, I think our better brand strategy that we have, we're comfortable with. We continue to test and try a set of brands to what the customers respond to -- so I would think we would continue to do that and then give her and offer her what she wants. But as it stands today, when it comes to brands and supply, as you know, -- it can also pick it out, right? So especially on better brands, they can be a lot and then it can temper they can come back up. So I think we're always looking to try to increase our brand strategy and try to offer the customer the best possible products and values that we can. And so that process would continue with over time, there were more opportunities and the customer was responding. We would continue to shift the assortment based on the customers' response. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Beth Reed with Truist Securities. \nBeth Reed Pricoli: I want to ask about the lower income consumer. Do you see any changes in purchasing patterns related to this specific customer cohort? Or any color on trends at Ross versus dd's? \nMichael Hartshorn: I wouldn't make any call-outs, Ross versus dd. dd's performance has been in line to both actually performed better with government stimulus earlier in the year but has maintained levels that are similar. \n And then -- in terms of changes, there are just so many factors that are happening with the consumer, whether it's COVID related, whether it's inflation, whether it's -- all the other things we're seeing, it would be hard to parse that specifically out on their behavior related to income factors. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the expanded opportunity for new store openings at both businesses, any adjustments in the size that you're making, how are you thinking about the regions where you're going to and expanding into and any framework this past fourth quarter of what you saw by region and how it was different by brand? \nMichael Hartshorn: On region performance, what we saw in the fourth quarter, as we said in the commentary, the top-performing regions included the Southeast and the Midwest. And then our largest regions, California, Florida and Texas. Texas was above the chain average, and California and Florida were slightly below. \n But in terms of how we're thinking about long-term store potential, where we -- what gives us confidence in that is we -- as we do every year, we look at research on the store potential. And there's a couple of factors that are important. First of all, more broadly, the consumers focus on value and convenience and then the brick-and-mortar retail closures but also the changing traffic patterns for evolving customer behavior post-COVID, our ability to cluster stores together in high-density and high-volume trade areas. We've had success in our smaller markets. And then last but not least, we have a favorable growth trends in our targeted demographics. So those are the changes that gives us confidence to increase the store count potential to 3,600 locations. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: It's about the long-term growth algorithm that you're laying out today, and it's more philosophical. Like why is now -- we're going into our third year where the comparables aren't exactly likely to live up to their name. Why is now the right time to lay out this long-term growth algorithm? And what gives you the confidence that you can put up sustainable comp growth? What kind of a macro do you need to hit your goals? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, I'd say, number one, Laura, is what we've talked about is given the customers' continued focus on value and convenience, we're in the right sector of retail -- and we think we have a large market share opportunity ahead of us. I think this is the first time, 2022 is a difficult year to predict. But -- we think we can grow market share, and we think we have the strategies in place to be able to do that. \nLaura Champine: If I can get a quick follow-on, Will the growth -- I think what I heard was store growth of about 5%. Would that push your CapEx in the out-years up to more like 4% or 5% of sales compared to the 3%, 3.5% you have been running historically? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's -- there's a couple of factors that go into the CapEx. Certainly, one of the most important is new store growth. But it can get choppy with our distribution center capital as we're -- as last year, we added a new distribution center that is opening early this year. So it can get a bit choppy. But going forward, I think it remains at these levels, maybe slightly up in future years based on distribution center capacity growth. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Freight inflation and wage inflation isn't the only cost inflation out there. Product costs are higher. What's the outlook for merchandise margin this year and long term? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. John, I'll jump in on that. Consistent with the prior quarters and 2021, merchandise margin was strong. Without ocean freight, it improved every quarter versus 2019. So while we expect ocean freight costs to remain elevated through 2022, we're going to anniversary that initial spike in ocean freight costs in the fall. So as we look forward into 2022, again, without the impact of ocean freight, we feel like it's healthy and will continue to be strong and grow in 2022, obviously, dependent on sales and inventory turns but feel strong about that. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. Just maybe one quick follow-up. Where are we in the wage inflation cycle at Ross stores, you seem to imply that you've taken wages up both in stores and DCs. We've heard quite a bit from some of your big-box competitors out there about where they're taking wages. Where are we in the wage inflation cycle here? Do you feel comfortable where you are now in both DCs and stores. \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I would say, into the year, we feel good about the changes we made last year, but we -- our approach has been to look at wages on a market-by-market basis versus a blanket approach. But I would also add there are statutory increases. There's minimum wage increases. California has large bumps year to year, and there's other large states for us that have minimum wage increases. So we're keeping up with those, and then we're making decisions on a market-by-market basis to make sure we can hire great talent across the chain. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Just on freight, I think you gave on a LLY basis, it was a 100 basis point headwind in Q4. Can you just say what that was year-over-year, just to give some context. And then if there's any way you could explain what's embedded. I think you said the cost should get much better as you move through next fiscal year. But what is the year-over-year headwind that you're currently anticipating, whether it's first half, full year? Anything that would be helpful would be great. \nMichael Hartshorn: Ike, we wouldn't give specifics on the deleverage. We usually would do that after the fact. But as I explained the back half of last year is when we started seeing significant increases in ocean freight as lead times extended, and we had to pay more in the spot rate market, so we're up against that. We'll be up against that next year, so it will be less of a headwind this year. \n Overall, we expect, though, that ocean freights will stay elevated all the way through the year and perhaps a bit higher, but the vast headwind will be in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, if that makes sense. \nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over back to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Betty Chen, Vice President, Investor Relations. We will begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2021 performance, followed by our outlook for '22 and the longer term. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we achieved strong sales results in the fourth quarter despite the negative impact from both the surge in Omicron cases during the peak holiday selling period and continued supply chain congestion. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended January 29, 2022, were $1.04 on net income of $367 million. This compared to $1.28 per share on net earnings of $456 million for the 13 weeks ended February 1, 2020. \n Total sales for the fourth quarter were $5 billion with comparable store sales up 9% versus the same period in 2019. For the 2021 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.87 on net income of $1.723 billion, up from $4.60 per share on net earnings of $1.661 billion in 2019. Total sales for 2021 rose 18% to $18.9 billion with comparable store sales up 13%. \n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling period, the best performing larger merchandise areas were children's and men's, while the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest regions. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained solid during the period. However, their profitability was also negatively impacted by cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID. \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 23% versus 2019, mainly from an increase in in-transit merchandise due to longer lead times from the industry-wide supply chain bottlenecks. Average store inventories were down slightly versus 2019, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories versus 46% 2 years ago. \n As noted in today's release, we are pleased to report that our Board recently authorized a new 2-year program to repurchase up to $1.9 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2023. This authorization replaces the $850 million remaining under the prior buyback we announced in May of last year. A total of $650 million of common stock was repurchased under the previous program in fiscal 2021. \n The Board also increased our quarterly cash dividend by 9% to $0.31 per share to be payable on March 31, 2022, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2022. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend program reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2022. Thank you, Adam. As mentioned in our press release, given consumers' increased focus on value and convenience, we have seen favorable sales trends in both our new and infill market stores. As a result, along with the large number of retail closures and bankruptcies over the last several years, we now believe that Ross Dress for Less can expand to about 2,900 locations, up from our prior target of 2,400 and that dd's DISCOUNTS can eventually become a chain of approximately 700 stores versus our previous projection of 600. This represents an overall 20% increase in our forecasted potential to 3,600 stores, providing substantial runway for expansion relative to our year-end store count of 1,923 locations. \n We operate in attractive sector of retail, and our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. Looking at 2023 and beyond, we are targeting a return to double-digit earnings per growth driven by a combination of same-store sales gains, operating margin, improvement accelerated new store openings and our ongoing stock repurchase program. \n In closing, we especially want to thank our approximately 100,000 talented associates throughout the company whose dedication has enabled us to successfully navigate through the unprecedented challenges of the past 2 years. We believe their continued efforts will enable us to capitalize on our opportunities for future sales and earnings growth while also delivering strong returns to stockholders over the coming years. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. And then as it pertains, Kimberly, to availability, there is definitely availability. But what I would say is it's not consistent across all merchandise departments and classifications.

So value is critical to us always, and it'll just be more important go forward. Sure. We have put in a strategic process where we actually go in and the buyers are constantly assessing the market to understand pricing and where there were there potentially opportunities to increase that pricing. And we started that last quarter, and it continued through this quarter. And the average price per SKU was up somewhat during the quarter. The way we're looking at it is we've had successes in many areas now compared to where we were, and we are watching it and evaluating it and I would say being cautious about moving the needle based off of where we sit in the food chain.

So I would say both companies, it's kind of -- it's an ongoing process, and it will be the same process that will continue. \n In terms of longer, you're saying an assortment strategy, could we trade up into more better brands? Look, I think our better brand strategy that we have, we're comfortable with. We continue to test and try a set of brands to what the customers respond to -- so I would think we would continue to do that and then give her and offer her what she wants. But as it stands today, when it comes to brands and supply, as you know, -- it can also pick it out, right? So especially on better brands, they can be a lot and then it can temper they can come back up. So I think we're always looking to try to increase our brand strategy and try to offer the customer the best possible products and values that we can. And so that process would continue with over time, there were more opportunities and the customer was responding. We would continue to shift the assortment based on the customers' response. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales increased 9% for the quarter. This gain was driven by growth in the size of the average basket, partially offset by a decline in transactions. Fourth quarter operating margin of 9.8% was down 350 basis points from 13.3% in 2019, mainly due to ongoing expense headwinds. Cost of goods sold increased 210 basis points due to a combination of factors. Domestic freight rose 100 basis points, and distribution costs increased 70 basis points, primarily due to the previously mentioned supply chain challenges, in addition to higher wages. Merchandise margin declined 50 basis points due to higher ocean freight costs, while buying expenses grew 20 basis points. Occupancy levered 30 basis points on higher sales volume. SG&A for the period rose 140 basis points, again, due to pressure from the holiday-related pay incentives, plus higher wages and COVID costs. Total net COVID-related expenses for the quarter were approximately 35 basis points with a higher impact to SG&A than cost of goods sold. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2022. As Barbara noted in our press release, 2022 is a difficult year to predict for numerous reasons. We are up against last year's record government stimulus and the lifting of COVID restrictions that led to unprecedented consumer demand, which fueled extraordinary sales gains in the spring of 2021. In addition, we continue to face industry-wide supply chain headwinds as well as external risks from the effects of inflation, both on consumer demand and on costs within our business. As a result, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 28, 2023, are planned to be flat to up 3% versus a 13% gain in 2021. \n Earnings per share for 2022 are projected to be $4.71 to $5.12 compared to $4.87 in 2021. This reflects our expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the year given the substantial cost increases we incurred in the fall of 2021. Our guidance assumptions for the 2022 year include total sales are forecast to grow by 2% to 6%. We plan to return to our more normal opening cadence of 100 new locations in 2022 comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, we expect to close about 10 older stores. \n Operating margin for the full year is planned to be in the 11.6% to 12.1% range, down slightly from 2021 due to deleveraging on lower same-store sales gains, and again, ongoing expense headwinds, especially in the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is estimated to be $70 million. Depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of stock-based amortization, is forecast to be about $560 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 348 million. \n In addition, capital expenditures for 2022 are planned to be approximately $800 million. This outlay will fund further investments in our supply chain to support long-term growth and in technology to increase efficiencies throughout the business in order to maximize our prospects to capture profitable market share going forward. \n Let's now turn to our guidance for the first quarter. In addition to the aforementioned stimulus benefits and strong pent-up demand early last year, we also faced larger headwinds from higher freight and wage costs early in the year. As a result, we are forecasting comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending April 30, 2022, to be down 2% to down 4% on top of a 13% gain for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Earnings per share for the 2022 first quarter are projected to be $0.93 to $0.99 versus $1.34 in the prior year period. \n The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance includes the following: Total sales are forecast to be down 2% to up 1% versus last year's first quarter. We plan to add 30 new stores, consisting of 22 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. We project first quarter operating margin to be 10.2% to 10.6% compared to 14.2% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect from the negative same-store sales assumption as well as ongoing expense pressure from freight and wage costs early in the year. Net interest expense is estimated to be $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25%, and diluted shares are forecast to be about $350 million. \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Kimberly, I'll start with the first quarter guidance, it's Michael Hartshorn. The first quarter last year, we saw a significant acceleration in March and April last year. As a reminder, the government stimulus hit in the -- started being disbursed to taxpayers in the third week. So that -- we're planning around that with our guidance. We had a slower start to the year last year and then had a significant acceleration as we move through the quarter. Obviously, we don't have -- it's been 40 years since the U.S. has seen this type of inflation, so we don't have a ton of experience on how the customer will react. So I'd be speculating as inflation appears at this point to be with us for a while, in general, I'd say the consumer seems to be healthy coming into the year, given higher wages and savings. But obviously, with this level of inflation throughout the economy, they're going to have to make choices how and where they spend their money, and it's highly likely the consumer will be seeking value, and that would be positive for us. Let me -- on the way we're thinking about this year, I'll just go through the components of expenses and then talk through the long-term model. Overall, like everyone in the U.S. economy, we're seeing cost inflation throughout the business. For us, it's most acutely felt in transportation, both domestic and ocean freight markets and also on the wage front. In those 3 areas, we have a very good line of sight on ocean freight and we know that they will remain elevated through 2022. \n On the domestic freight, we don't expect the same type of headwinds on core domestic freight, although we do expect, especially with the current geopolitics, we do expect volatility in fuel-related costs. And then on wages with low unemployment rates, the overall labor market continues to be very tight, although the warehousing labor market has been the most competitive over the last year. All that said, we believe we're well positioned to start the year, especially given the wage actions we took in the back half of 2021. \n On the long-term model, given our market share opportunity with the consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience and given the fact that we're facing less brick-and-mortar competition, we believe we have a market share opportunity going forward. So looking into 2023, we're -- as you mentioned, we're targeting double-digit earnings per share growth. And the model or the formula looks very similar to what it looked like prior to the pandemic, and that's a combination of new store growth around 5%, comp sales of 3% to 4% with EBIT margin expansion at the high end of that range. And with the stock repurchase program, that adds up to the double-digit EPS growth. We wouldn't comment on inter-quarter trends for us. Obviously, the latest information we can talk about is in January, what we did see during the quarter, as Omicron spiked, surged right before Christmas, we did see a falloff on traffic, but the customer with their fewer trips bought more per transaction as we progressed through the remainder of the quarter. I wouldn't make any call-outs, Ross versus dd. dd's performance has been in line to both actually performed better with government stimulus earlier in the year but has maintained levels that are similar. \n And then -- in terms of changes, there are just so many factors that are happening with the consumer, whether it's COVID related, whether it's inflation, whether it's -- all the other things we're seeing, it would be hard to parse that specifically out on their behavior related to income factors. On region performance, what we saw in the fourth quarter, as we said in the commentary, the top-performing regions included the Southeast and the Midwest. And then our largest regions, California, Florida and Texas. Texas was above the chain average, and California and Florida were slightly below. \n But in terms of how we're thinking about long-term store potential, where we -- what gives us confidence in that is we -- as we do every year, we look at research on the store potential. And there's a couple of factors that are important. First of all, more broadly, the consumers focus on value and convenience and then the brick-and-mortar retail closures but also the changing traffic patterns for evolving customer behavior post-COVID, our ability to cluster stores together in high-density and high-volume trade areas. We've had success in our smaller markets. And then last but not least, we have a favorable growth trends in our targeted demographics. So those are the changes that gives us confidence to increase the store count potential to 3,600 locations. Well, I'd say, number one, Laura, is what we've talked about is given the customers' continued focus on value and convenience, we're in the right sector of retail -- and we think we have a large market share opportunity ahead of us. I think this is the first time, 2022 is a difficult year to predict. But -- we think we can grow market share, and we think we have the strategies in place to be able to do that. It's -- there's a couple of factors that go into the CapEx. Certainly, one of the most important is new store growth. But it can get choppy with our distribution center capital as we're -- as last year, we added a new distribution center that is opening early this year. So it can get a bit choppy. But going forward, I think it remains at these levels, maybe slightly up in future years based on distribution center capacity growth. Yes. John, I'll jump in on that. Consistent with the prior quarters and 2021, merchandise margin was strong. Without ocean freight, it improved every quarter versus 2019. So while we expect ocean freight costs to remain elevated through 2022, we're going to anniversary that initial spike in ocean freight costs in the fall. So as we look forward into 2022, again, without the impact of ocean freight, we feel like it's healthy and will continue to be strong and grow in 2022, obviously, dependent on sales and inventory turns but feel strong about that. Yes. I would say, into the year, we feel good about the changes we made last year, but we -- our approach has been to look at wages on a market-by-market basis versus a blanket approach. But I would also add there are statutory increases. There's minimum wage increases. California has large bumps year to year, and there's other large states for us that have minimum wage increases. So we're keeping up with those, and then we're making decisions on a market-by-market basis to make sure we can hire great talent across the chain. Ike, we wouldn't give specifics on the deleverage. We usually would do that after the fact. But as I explained the back half of last year is when we started seeing significant increases in ocean freight as lead times extended, and we had to pay more in the spot rate market, so we're up against that. We'll be up against that next year, so it will be less of a headwind this year. \n Overall, we expect, though, that ocean freights will stay elevated all the way through the year and perhaps a bit higher, but the vast headwind will be in the first half of the year versus the second half of the year, if that makes sense."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, COVID-related costs and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.  \n These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2020 Form 10-K and fiscal 2021 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. And I'd also like to welcome Adam Orvos, our recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, third quarter sales and profitability significantly exceeded our expectations as consumers continued to respond favorably to our broad assortment of great bargains. We achieved these results despite waning government stimulus and uncertainties related to the spread of COVID variants. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, were $1.09 on net income of $385 million. This compares to $1.03 per share on net earnings of $371 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2019.  \n Total sales for the quarter rose 19% to $4.6 billion with strong comparable store sales increase of 14%. For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.82 on net earnings of $1.4 billion, up from $3.32 per share on net income of $1.2 billion for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first 9 months of this year rose 20% to $13.9 billion with comparable store sales up 14%.  \n For the third quarter at Ross, children and men's were the best-performing businesses while the Midwest and Southeast were the top-performing regions. dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained strong during the period as their sales performance also significantly exceeded our expectations. However, like Ross, dd's profitability was negatively impacted by cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID.  \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 3%, while average selling store inventories were down 1% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 31% of the total compared to 39% for the same period in 2019 as we continued to use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales. In addition, there were receipt delays due to supply chain congestion.  \n Turning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2021 with the addition of 18 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter. For the full year, we added 65 locations comprised of 44 Ross and 21 dd's DISCOUNTS. Additionally, we plan to close 1 store by year-end. As previously mentioned, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 stores in 2022. Now Adam Orvos will provide further details on our third quarter results, fourth quarter guidance and updated outlook for the year. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were up 14% in the quarter. The increase was mainly driven by a larger average basket with traffic down slightly versus 2019. Operating margin of 11.4% was well above our guidance range. As expected, the decline in overall profitability versus 2019 was mainly due to ongoing headwinds from higher freight, wage and COVID-related costs.  \n Cost of goods sold grew by 85 basis points in the quarter. Domestic freight expenses increased 125 basis points, while higher ocean freight costs negatively impacted merchandise margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Buying also rose by 10 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by occupancy and distribution leverage of 65 and 25 basis points, respectively.  \n SG&A for the period grew 15 basis points as leverage from the strong sales gain was offset by COVID expenses and higher incentive costs given our better-than-expected third quarter results. Total net COVID-related costs for the period were approximately 35 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.  \n During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $241 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $650 million in stock for the year.  \n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections compare to the same period in 2019. Looking ahead, while we are encouraged by the ongoing strength of consumer demand, there remains significant uncertainty related to the worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion as we enter the important holiday season. As a result and while we hope to do better, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 7% to 9% with earnings per share projected in the range of $0.83 to $0.93 for the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2022.  \n The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 10% to 13%. We expect operating margin to be 8.1% to 8.8%. This forecast primarily reflects ongoing pressure from the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds as well as holiday pay incentives in our stores and distribution centers. In addition, COVID-related costs are projected to negatively impact EBIT margin by approximately 30 basis points in the period.  \n Net interest expense is estimated to be about $18 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 352 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, we are now forecasting full year comparable store sales gains of 12% to 13% and earnings per share in the range of $4.65 to $4.75 compared to $4.60 in 2019. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. We're encouraged by our above-plan sales year-to-date. As Adam noted, uncertainty remains on how industry-wide supply chain congestion may negatively affect our business in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we are well positioned as a value retailer and are confident customers will find broad assortments of great branded bargains in our stores for the holiday season.  \n Moving forward, consumers' increasing focus on value and convenience, along with a large number of retail -- recent retail closures and bankruptcies, make us confident about our prospects for continued market share gains in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  We have our first question coming from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter. So Barbara, with 3 straight quarters, 13% to 15% 2-year comps, could you elaborate on market share gains tied to value and convenience that you're seeing? And then given the closures and bankruptcies that you cited, how would you best characterize product availability in the marketplace today? \nMichael Hartshorn: Matthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. On market share gains, longer term, we're very excited about the market share opportunity ahead of us. We're in a very healthy sector of retail with the consumer even more focused, as you mentioned, on value and convenience. We've clearly gained market share during the pandemic and are confident about our future prospects for further gains, given the significant number of retail closures and bankruptcies. \nBarbara Rentler: And Matthew, in terms of product availability, I have a [ good feeling ], it's a good time to be a buyer, maybe not in every category but some areas are very good. Others are inconsistent but overall, it's favorable. Even with store closures, one would expect that over time, as -- after COVID as retail settles, that the market will get more bullish on creating more goods. But right now, we really feel good about market availability. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Welcome, Adam. I'm curious, just with the more inflationary backdrop, are you seeing more opportunities to raise ticket while still maintaining the strong value proposition? Or how are you thinking about this lever to offset some of the ongoing freight and expense pressures? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Look, our pricing model is really built off of other mainstream retailers and then we provide a discount. So we're very aware of pricing at different levels of distribution and we watch it closely. With that, we've continued to experiment with higher retail in all areas in the new organization. In some cases, it's been absolutely fine, and in some cases, not quite as fine. And I wouldn't elaborate more on that in this forum. But what I would say is we would adjust pricing over time once we understand it. We don't know where it's really all going at this point, but we are definitely experimenting with different retails. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: You referenced ongoing strength of consumer demand. I was curious if that was a comment on the fourth quarter to date, if you're seeing that continue. You also referenced worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion, and I'm curious if that's hurting you thus far in 4Q to a greater degree than what you saw in 3Q. And big picture, I'm wondering if you think that congestion will ultimately be good for your business, either in fourth quarter or into '22. \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, we are seeing a very healthy consumer. When we came into the quarter, we were worried about the Delta variant and also the receding government stimulus. But we've continued to see a very healthy consumer with strong demand for us across geographies, merchandise areas, and you can see relatively across retail, one that is increasingly focused on price value.  \n On the freight front, we've taken a number of actions to ready ourselves for the holiday selling period, including adjusting our ordering times. We chartered our own ocean vessel, and we've been purchasing at market rate capacity to make sure we have enough ocean freight to move goods. You can see that certainly in our margins for the quarter. Our merchant margin was impacted by ocean freight that we weren't able to offset, with merchant margin down about 40 basis points. I wouldn't comment on the impact in the third quarter. The congestion right now is squarely focused on the port and getting goods out of the port. \nPaul Lejuez: And the merchandise margin, you said it was down 40 basis points. What -- you said that was impacted by ocean. Can you separate the pure merch margin versus the ocean piece? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't break that out separately. Ocean freight is actually included in our merchant margin. Merchant margin ended up better than we expected for the quarter as we had more full-price selling and faster turns with the inventory ahead of plan -- our sales ahead of plan. \nBarbara Rentler: And then I would say, as it pertains to the supply chain congestion, it should create more closeout opportunities for us in the future. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Barbara, I know you said it's a good time to be a buyer, but I just wanted to focus in on any risk around receipt timing ahead of holiday. And then what are you hearing from your vendors going into the spring of next year vis-\u00e0-vis product availability and the categories you really want to focus on? \nBarbara Rentler: On receipt timing ahead of holiday, I think we've taken all the appropriate actions as it pertains to receipt timing, whether Michael just said chartering the vessel, building in longer lead times, everything to get goods through the port. But with that, we have concerns, not a given but we have some concerns. As we think about product for spring, I think vendors have gotten very aggressive in terms of pricing goods. I think there are some vendors that are really looking to gain some market share in this time frame and have taken bigger risk in terms of making commitments. So I think it's very much on who the vendor is and what their strategy is. But in terms of -- again, in terms of timing for holiday, we've taken the assets we think we need to take. But again, we have some concerns but it's not a given. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. I just wanted to follow up on Lorraine's question just about holiday, Barbara, and just want to make sure I understand you clearly. So how are you feeling about your in-stock levels currently here, call it, middle of November? And how do you feel about your inventory position here for the next sort of 6 weeks of holiday selling? If you could just give us a little bit of color just on the short term. And then I wanted to ask a couple of other questions, if I could. \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on inventory position currently, we're in a good shape. We ended the quarter with average in-store inventories down about 1%, which is where we wanted them to be, and we continue to have a fresh flow of product. There are a lot of receipts between now and the next 6 weeks. And there could be some risk in areas like home that, as Barbara mentioned, they're not a given but we reflected that risk in our guidance at 7% to 9%. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, got it. And is it -- are the receipts risk concentrated in home because that's where you would have, call it, more of a direct import or more of the direct imports would be impacting that area and those would be the items that would be either stuck in ports or on ocean-going vessels? \nMichael Hartshorn: Correct, right. Mainly -- we have 6 weeks left mainly stuck in ports. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, mainly stuck in ports. Okay, perfect. That is great, okay. And then on the quarter, Michael or Adam, whoever wants to address this, you talked about larger basket size. I'm wondering if you can talk about the average unit retail versus the units per transaction, what's driving that? And then just longer term, following up on the question with regard to pricing. I'm not sure if you have taken a look at where you're sitting competitively versus peers. But is there -- I know there are some of your peers looking at some surgical price increases in some categories. I'm just wondering if you've taken a look at your pricing and re-benchmarked it recently, if you have any thoughts on that. \nAdam Orvos: Yes, this is Adam. Let me jump in on the first part of that question. So our strong comps were driven by size of basket, which was primarily driven by a number of units per transaction. We did have a slight increase in AUR, driven by the better full-price selling, given the above-plan sales. And then as we mentioned, there was a slight decline in traffic in the quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And then as it pertains to the pricing issue, we are definitely experimenting with higher retails. And I said in some areas, it's working, it's fine. In some areas, it's not fine. I think we'll continue to do that, Kimberly, and fine-tune what the customer is willing to accept as we watch what goes on in mainstream retailers and where their AURs sit. And after we get comfortable, over time, we would consider adjusting the pricing once we really understand it. \n But as we get ready to enter into Q4, we're not expecting mainstream retailers to promote but we don't really know that as you get into Q4, and there's really this compressed period of time. So with that, again, merchants are out there trying new things, trying retail, seeing what the customer is willing to accept. But we kind of need to see both of those things to take, I would say, a larger step. \nKimberly Greenberger: Perfect. Makes perfect sense. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: I was wondering if you guys could speak to the trend of your comp there in the quarter. And if you think weather had any impact, adverse impact, particularly in September and October? And any early thoughts on the first couple of weeks of November? It sounds like the trend has stayed strong but just wanted to confirm that. \nAdam Orvos: This is Adam, I can take that. So comps were strong throughout the quarter and really no -- weather impact was very immaterial in the quarter. \nMichael Hartshorn: And we wouldn't comment on intra-quarter trends. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: I'm just curious, as you look at the guidance, what you guys are seeing in the business that helped you build to a 7% to 9% guidance for fourth quarter. I think the last prior 2 quarters, it was 5% to 7%. Just any change on how you built up with it. But then, I guess Michael, when you -- can you help -- I know you won't give us a number to Paul's question earlier, but when you think about what you baked into freight in the fourth quarter, maybe just some directional idea of how that looks relative to third quarter. \n And then as you look out, maybe just -- thinking about when your contracts roll, how much visibility you have into the first half of next year and help us understand if it's -- if we should think that, that's still going to be an incremental headwind into the first half based on what you guys know today. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Michael. Let me generally talk about the fourth quarter guidance. Obviously, in these uncertain times, we believe it's prudent to be conservative, as we always have with our guidance, and hope to exceed these estimates. Obviously, the large difference between Q3 is a cautious comp estimate, given the potential impact of unpredictable supply chain congestion. \n The guidance also includes ongoing freight pressure related to the congestion. I would say it's not significantly worse than it was in Q3. It also includes elevated wage-related costs due to holiday incentives in both our stores and distribution centers to acknowledge our associates' extraordinary dedication throughout the pandemic. What we'd expect on that is above -- sales above the estimates, we'd expect 15 to 20 basis points of leverage. \n On freight congestion, I think our view at this point is we would not expect freight to subside probably through the first half of next year. And then we'll have to see how it trends after that. In terms of what impact that could have, we'll have more to say in our year-end call as we finish up wrapping up our budget cycle. \nMichael Binetti: Okay. If I could follow that. Just as you look at some of the AUR initiatives that you are seeing success with, Barb, do you feel like you have enough at this point to combat that freight pressure in the first half as needed? \nBarbara Rentler: No. I think where we are now is that we will continue to test the AUR and then make probably slower moves so we really understand what that looks like in mainstream retailers. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: Great. I just want to know if you can share with us, high level, I'm not looking for any specific guidance, but going into first quarter next year, lapping the stimulus. How much of a benefit do you think you got from the stimulus in the first quarter of this year? And how do you think it might play out next year as you lap that, what kind of impact would it have on sales? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. At this point, we wouldn't comment on next year. As I said, we'll have more to say after we wrap up the fourth quarter and provide guidance in our year-end call in early March. \nJay Sole: Okay. And maybe if I can just ask one more then. There's a lot of talk about how the pandemic has changed shopping and consumers may be adopting more of an omni-channel method. If you look at the operating income growth for your department store competitors over the last 3 quarters, it's up over 100%. Versus off-price, it's up more like 10%. Do you feel at all like something has changed where maybe the department stores are catching up a little bit? And if not, why not? \nMichael Hartshorn: Catching up in what regard? \nJay Sole: Just catching up in a way that like you've outgrown them in terms of sales. You mentioned the market share gains that you've taken, outgrown them in terms of profit, but maybe they're getting closer to competing and being able, maybe not necessarily maintain the same level of sales, but maybe getting more profitable, which ultimately could be an advantage they could use to sort of catch up in other ways as well. \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I think overall, we'll have to see how it plays out. I mean, we're still in this burst of economic activity where demand is exceeding supply. I think we have to understand what happens when it's a more -- a greater balance between supply and demand, which we'll see if that's first quarter or second quarter of next year. So it's hard to say at this point. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations. Could we just talk a little bit about 2 things? As the consumer's back out and about, working events, parties, have you seen a shift in what she's buying or are you continuing to see strength across the board? And then if you can also just touch on, with all of the late deliveries in the market, have you been able to still get in the very holiday-rich type of items, Christmas-themed items? Or were you able to tap into packaways from last year's holiday to make sure that, that was on the floor in time? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure, Marni. We have seen a shift with the customers. Look, we've always had a big casual business, let me tell you that. That's always been a big business for us. And certainly during the pandemic, that business got even bigger and stronger for us. But what we have seen is we have seen the customer make a shift back into what you're looking for as holiday, glitz, dress-up, specials [ ongoing there ]. We have seen the customer make that shift into holiday product and also just more into more mainstream sports brands. So a little bit of both. So casual is still very good, still a business that we believe and it will expand and get greater, but she is making a shift, whether it's back to work or she's going out for easing, whatever she's doing, we have seen that, yes. \nMarni Shapiro: What about like in the home and like bags, like those kinds of bags to go back to work or the home area, if she's going back to work and not thinking about her home as much? I don't know. \nBarbara Rentler: You're saying like in handbags? \nMarni Shapiro: Yes. Has she shifted into handbags as she's going out again or out of home and into apparel more? Those kinds of bigger shifts as well? \nBarbara Rentler: I think anything where she is leaving her house in -- on the apparel side has taken a shift, whether it's in footwear, whether it's in handbags. She hasn't replenished, replaced a lot of those products in a long time. So yes, we are seeing a shift back into some of those businesses as she goes out. She wants new stuff. So whether it's home or apparel though, Marni, I would say both businesses have been relatively similar in sales gain. So she's kind of traveling between both worlds now. I think the surge in apparel is because she just doesn't own it. \nMarni Shapiro: Yes, that makes sense. And then just on the packaway? \nBarbara Rentler: And then on packaway, we -- and how it's just -- just do me a favor, just remind me that piece again on packaway because I think I might have interpreted it as the holiday piece. Hit me back with that question again. Marni? \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: Should we hold up and try to get Marni back or would you prefer I fire ahead? \nMichael Hartshorn: Fire ahead. We'll call Marni later. \nBarbara Rentler: Go ahead. We'll find Marni later. \nLaura Champine: Okay, here goes. I thought the SG&A expense level was really impressive, given that I think you're saying that COVID is still an incremental hit. Are we -- is this kind of a base level that we can look at as we start to model for next year? What are kind of some of the puts and takes that are keeping, despite really strong top line, that SG&A expense is staying fairly flat? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes -- go ahead. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. No, I was just going to jump in and say, COVID's been a pretty consistent impact throughout the year and will be in fourth quarter. We talked about the actions we've taken from a wage standpoint and from an incentive standpoint in our DCs and our stores. Those are clearly kind of the biggest movers within SG&A. \nMichael Hartshorn: And then obviously, I would say the 14% comp helps us leverage the SG&A significantly. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our next question coming from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Just wondering if you could maybe spend a little bit more time on the labor component and just sort of the wage pressures that you're seeing in labor availability. Maybe just give us some insights on that. That would be helpful. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Bob. It's a very competitive market for talent, and we've seen the most competition in our distribution centers. We made some permanent wage increases early this year. We also have some retention and incentives to get us through the peak. We're in really good shape. We've been able to staff up the peak. The distribution centers are where they need to be in the stores. Obviously, we have holiday selling ahead of us. We also have incentive -- hiring incentives there to make sure we can staff up for peak, and we're confident that we're in a good place there as well. Given the competition, we'll remain competitive to make sure that we can -- we'll remain competitive with our pay to make sure we can attract talent, and we feel really good about the workforce right now. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Congratulations on the progress on the top line in the quarter. Barbara, you made a comment during the prepared remarks. You said you should see improvement in kind of closeout buying. And I'm wondering, are you seeing any incrementality in that, in increased supply flow from either canceled orders or stranded inventory that could be used for short-stay buys and redeploy it earlier next year? And then just a clarification question on the, Adam, on the freight. The 160 basis points of freight pressure this quarter, fourth quarter is similar and then carrying that same level through the first half of '22? Is that the implication that you were intending? \nAdam Orvos: I'll start with the freight. I was making no commentary on what the freight cost level will be next year. I was really answering that in terms of what congestion could look like. Obviously, we'll have some other different options first quarter versus the fourth. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of the content of the closeout buying, certainly, our expectation is that there will be full product as retailers have canceled goods because they're late and they can't get to the selling floor. So that would be real packaway for fall for Q3, Q4 of next year. But we do see opportunities on, I would guess what you're thinking of as kind of seasonless apparel that we could flow now through Q1. I believe it's a combination of both. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay, fantastic. Last question, if you would. Where is the average hourly rate? I seem to recall a few years ago, maybe 2018 or '19, you had sort of committed to this $12 number, and that was typically almost $1 higher than the average across the nation. I know you're at the better end of pay. I'm just wondering where that number sits today maybe relative to where Walmart, Target and some others are in that mid-teen range. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. We don't disclose the specific wage. We do have a base level at $11, but a significant portion of the chain is under minimum wage. California, for instance, is at $15, so the average wage is well above that baseline. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Fair enough. Thank you very much and best of luck for holiday. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Sorry if I missed it, did you say where you expect inventory to end 4Q and then over the next few quarters? And then to the earlier point about outperforming despite waning stimulus, have you guys quantified what you think the benefit was from stimulus? And just how you're thinking about the potential impacts as we cycle through that early next year. \nMichael Hartshorn: On next year, we wouldn't comment. We'll comment again at year-end. On inventory, we typically don't guide ahead on inventory levels. \nSimeon Siegel: So I guess for the stimulus, have you quantified what it was this year, how you think about the benefit this year? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's really hard because there's a lot of moving parts because it's not only stimulus, it's customer pent-up demand. We'll end up developing plans around it as we move into next year but we haven't quantified that. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nJesse Sobelson: Hi, everyone. This is Jesse Sobelson on for Ike. And I was just wondering, as we look forward and begin to model next year, would you guys be able to quantify timing of when COVID costs might be able to revert? Or are you expecting that to sustain and these costs to just kind of be a part of the business going forward? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't comment specifically on next year, but we would expect -- I would say generally, we would expect COVID costs to come down. They are not wholly permanently part of the cost. \nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Just curious on the margin picture. You obviously outperformed your comp guidance, and the EBIT margin was down roughly 100 basis points from the pre-COVID base in '19. You're guiding it much lower than that, albeit on lower comp guidance for the fourth quarter. Just curious, what do you think the biggest levers are to recapture that low teens operating margin that you generated in 2019? There's a lot of inflation across retail, the factories, your vendors, supply chain. Just curious how you think you're going to recapture that pre-COVID level of profitability? Is it really just through more comp store sales gains? How do we quantify that? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, John. As I said, obviously, we're in a very healthy sector of retail and are confident in our prospects for further market share gains. As we sit here today, it's difficult to predict how much of the inflationary cost headwinds we're experiencing from the burst of economic activity are transitory versus permanent. So margin recovery will be dependent on where and when those costs stabilize. \n And of course, our sales volume, where we once again, we believe we have a long-range, large market share opportunity ahead of us. Over time, we would expect to return to double-digit EPS growth on the 3% to 4% comp. We do have initiatives in the company to try to increase efficiencies in our big areas of expense, including our stores and distribution centers, but it's going to be largely dependent on the transitory nature of the inflation that we're seeing today. \nOperator: We have our last question coming from the line of Tim Vierengel with Northcoast Research. \nTimothy Vierengel: Can you guys remind us of how you're thinking about store footprint and unit growth? And then maybe highlight for us if that environment or setup is getting easier or more difficult as you look forward? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the real estate front, as we said in our comments, we ended up -- we wrapped up our program for this year. We opened 65 stores. We also said that we expect to return to historical annual program in 2022 of opening 100 stores annually. Overall, the real estate market is good. And we would expect there to be increased supply of available sites, given the level of store closures. \nTimothy Vierengel: Good. Sorry I missed that. \nOperator: There are no further questions on queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Happy holidays. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. And I'd also like to welcome Adam Orvos, our recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, third quarter sales and profitability significantly exceeded our expectations as consumers continued to respond favorably to our broad assortment of great bargains. We achieved these results despite waning government stimulus and uncertainties related to the spread of COVID variants. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021, were $1.09 on net income of $385 million. This compares to $1.03 per share on net earnings of $371 million for the 13 weeks ended November 2, 2019.  \n Total sales for the quarter rose 19% to $4.6 billion with strong comparable store sales increase of 14%. For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.82 on net earnings of $1.4 billion, up from $3.32 per share on net income of $1.2 billion for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first 9 months of this year rose 20% to $13.9 billion with comparable store sales up 14%.  \n For the third quarter at Ross, children and men's were the best-performing businesses while the Midwest and Southeast were the top-performing regions. dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained strong during the period as their sales performance also significantly exceeded our expectations. However, like Ross, dd's profitability was negatively impacted by cost pressures related to freight, wages and COVID.  \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 3%, while average selling store inventories were down 1% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 31% of the total compared to 39% for the same period in 2019 as we continued to use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales. In addition, there were receipt delays due to supply chain congestion.  \n Turning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2021 with the addition of 18 new Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter. For the full year, we added 65 locations comprised of 44 Ross and 21 dd's DISCOUNTS. Additionally, we plan to close 1 store by year-end. As previously mentioned, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 stores in 2022. Now Adam Orvos will provide further details on our third quarter results, fourth quarter guidance and updated outlook for the year. Thank you, Adam. We're encouraged by our above-plan sales year-to-date. As Adam noted, uncertainty remains on how industry-wide supply chain congestion may negatively affect our business in the fourth quarter. That said, we believe we are well positioned as a value retailer and are confident customers will find broad assortments of great branded bargains in our stores for the holiday season.  \n Moving forward, consumers' increasing focus on value and convenience, along with a large number of retail -- recent retail closures and bankruptcies, make us confident about our prospects for continued market share gains in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. And Matthew, in terms of product availability, I have a [ good feeling ], it's a good time to be a buyer, maybe not in every category but some areas are very good. Others are inconsistent but overall, it's favorable. Even with store closures, one would expect that over time, as -- after COVID as retail settles, that the market will get more bullish on creating more goods. But right now, we really feel good about market availability. Sure. Look, our pricing model is really built off of other mainstream retailers and then we provide a discount. So we're very aware of pricing at different levels of distribution and we watch it closely. With that, we've continued to experiment with higher retail in all areas in the new organization. In some cases, it's been absolutely fine, and in some cases, not quite as fine. And I wouldn't elaborate more on that in this forum. But what I would say is we would adjust pricing over time once we understand it. We don't know where it's really all going at this point, but we are definitely experimenting with different retails. And then I would say, as it pertains to the supply chain congestion, it should create more closeout opportunities for us in the future. On receipt timing ahead of holiday, I think we've taken all the appropriate actions as it pertains to receipt timing, whether Michael just said chartering the vessel, building in longer lead times, everything to get goods through the port. But with that, we have concerns, not a given but we have some concerns. As we think about product for spring, I think vendors have gotten very aggressive in terms of pricing goods. I think there are some vendors that are really looking to gain some market share in this time frame and have taken bigger risk in terms of making commitments. So I think it's very much on who the vendor is and what their strategy is. But in terms of -- again, in terms of timing for holiday, we've taken the assets we think we need to take. But again, we have some concerns but it's not a given. And then as it pertains to the pricing issue, we are definitely experimenting with higher retails. And I said in some areas, it's working, it's fine. In some areas, it's not fine. I think we'll continue to do that, Kimberly, and fine-tune what the customer is willing to accept as we watch what goes on in mainstream retailers and where their AURs sit. And after we get comfortable, over time, we would consider adjusting the pricing once we really understand it. \n But as we get ready to enter into Q4, we're not expecting mainstream retailers to promote but we don't really know that as you get into Q4, and there's really this compressed period of time. So with that, again, merchants are out there trying new things, trying retail, seeing what the customer is willing to accept. But we kind of need to see both of those things to take, I would say, a larger step. No. I think where we are now is that we will continue to test the AUR and then make probably slower moves so we really understand what that looks like in mainstream retailers. Sure, Marni. We have seen a shift with the customers. Look, we've always had a big casual business, let me tell you that. That's always been a big business for us. And certainly during the pandemic, that business got even bigger and stronger for us. But what we have seen is we have seen the customer make a shift back into what you're looking for as holiday, glitz, dress-up, specials [ ongoing there ]. We have seen the customer make that shift into holiday product and also just more into more mainstream sports brands. So a little bit of both. So casual is still very good, still a business that we believe and it will expand and get greater, but she is making a shift, whether it's back to work or she's going out for easing, whatever she's doing, we have seen that, yes. You're saying like in handbags? I think anything where she is leaving her house in -- on the apparel side has taken a shift, whether it's in footwear, whether it's in handbags. She hasn't replenished, replaced a lot of those products in a long time. So yes, we are seeing a shift back into some of those businesses as she goes out. She wants new stuff. So whether it's home or apparel though, Marni, I would say both businesses have been relatively similar in sales gain. So she's kind of traveling between both worlds now. I think the surge in apparel is because she just doesn't own it. And then on packaway, we -- and how it's just -- just do me a favor, just remind me that piece again on packaway because I think I might have interpreted it as the holiday piece. Hit me back with that question again. Marni? Go ahead. We'll find Marni later. And then in terms of the content of the closeout buying, certainly, our expectation is that there will be full product as retailers have canceled goods because they're late and they can't get to the selling floor. So that would be real packaway for fall for Q3, Q4 of next year. But we do see opportunities on, I would guess what you're thinking of as kind of seasonless apparel that we could flow now through Q1. I believe it's a combination of both. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Happy holidays."

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were up 14% in the quarter. The increase was mainly driven by a larger average basket with traffic down slightly versus 2019. Operating margin of 11.4% was well above our guidance range. As expected, the decline in overall profitability versus 2019 was mainly due to ongoing headwinds from higher freight, wage and COVID-related costs.  \n Cost of goods sold grew by 85 basis points in the quarter. Domestic freight expenses increased 125 basis points, while higher ocean freight costs negatively impacted merchandise margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Buying also rose by 10 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by occupancy and distribution leverage of 65 and 25 basis points, respectively.  \n SG&A for the period grew 15 basis points as leverage from the strong sales gain was offset by COVID expenses and higher incentive costs given our better-than-expected third quarter results. Total net COVID-related costs for the period were approximately 35 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.  \n During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $241 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $650 million in stock for the year.  \n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections compare to the same period in 2019. Looking ahead, while we are encouraged by the ongoing strength of consumer demand, there remains significant uncertainty related to the worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion as we enter the important holiday season. As a result and while we hope to do better, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 7% to 9% with earnings per share projected in the range of $0.83 to $0.93 for the 13 weeks ending January 29, 2022.  \n The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 10% to 13%. We expect operating margin to be 8.1% to 8.8%. This forecast primarily reflects ongoing pressure from the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds as well as holiday pay incentives in our stores and distribution centers. In addition, COVID-related costs are projected to negatively impact EBIT margin by approximately 30 basis points in the period.  \n Net interest expense is estimated to be about $18 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 22% to 23%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 352 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, we are now forecasting full year comparable store sales gains of 12% to 13% and earnings per share in the range of $4.65 to $4.75 compared to $4.60 in 2019. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes, this is Adam. Let me jump in on the first part of that question. So our strong comps were driven by size of basket, which was primarily driven by a number of units per transaction. We did have a slight increase in AUR, driven by the better full-price selling, given the above-plan sales. And then as we mentioned, there was a slight decline in traffic in the quarter. This is Adam, I can take that. So comps were strong throughout the quarter and really no -- weather impact was very immaterial in the quarter. Yes. No, I was just going to jump in and say, COVID's been a pretty consistent impact throughout the year and will be in fourth quarter. We talked about the actions we've taken from a wage standpoint and from an incentive standpoint in our DCs and our stores. Those are clearly kind of the biggest movers within SG&A. I'll start with the freight. I was making no commentary on what the freight cost level will be next year. I was really answering that in terms of what congestion could look like. Obviously, we'll have some other different options first quarter versus the fourth. Yes. We don't disclose the specific wage. We do have a base level at $11, but a significant portion of the chain is under minimum wage. California, for instance, is at $15, so the average wage is well above that baseline."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Matthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. On market share gains, longer term, we're very excited about the market share opportunity ahead of us. We're in a very healthy sector of retail with the consumer even more focused, as you mentioned, on value and convenience. We've clearly gained market share during the pandemic and are confident about our future prospects for further gains, given the significant number of retail closures and bankruptcies. Paul, we are seeing a very healthy consumer. When we came into the quarter, we were worried about the Delta variant and also the receding government stimulus. But we've continued to see a very healthy consumer with strong demand for us across geographies, merchandise areas, and you can see relatively across retail, one that is increasingly focused on price value.  \n On the freight front, we've taken a number of actions to ready ourselves for the holiday selling period, including adjusting our ordering times. We chartered our own ocean vessel, and we've been purchasing at market rate capacity to make sure we have enough ocean freight to move goods. You can see that certainly in our margins for the quarter. Our merchant margin was impacted by ocean freight that we weren't able to offset, with merchant margin down about 40 basis points. I wouldn't comment on the impact in the third quarter. The congestion right now is squarely focused on the port and getting goods out of the port. We wouldn't break that out separately. Ocean freight is actually included in our merchant margin. Merchant margin ended up better than we expected for the quarter as we had more full-price selling and faster turns with the inventory ahead of plan -- our sales ahead of plan. Kimberly, on inventory position currently, we're in a good shape. We ended the quarter with average in-store inventories down about 1%, which is where we wanted them to be, and we continue to have a fresh flow of product. There are a lot of receipts between now and the next 6 weeks. And there could be some risk in areas like home that, as Barbara mentioned, they're not a given but we reflected that risk in our guidance at 7% to 9%. Correct, right. Mainly -- we have 6 weeks left mainly stuck in ports. And we wouldn't comment on intra-quarter trends. Sure, Michael. Let me generally talk about the fourth quarter guidance. Obviously, in these uncertain times, we believe it's prudent to be conservative, as we always have with our guidance, and hope to exceed these estimates. Obviously, the large difference between Q3 is a cautious comp estimate, given the potential impact of unpredictable supply chain congestion. \n The guidance also includes ongoing freight pressure related to the congestion. I would say it's not significantly worse than it was in Q3. It also includes elevated wage-related costs due to holiday incentives in both our stores and distribution centers to acknowledge our associates' extraordinary dedication throughout the pandemic. What we'd expect on that is above -- sales above the estimates, we'd expect 15 to 20 basis points of leverage. \n On freight congestion, I think our view at this point is we would not expect freight to subside probably through the first half of next year. And then we'll have to see how it trends after that. In terms of what impact that could have, we'll have more to say in our year-end call as we finish up wrapping up our budget cycle. Yes. At this point, we wouldn't comment on next year. As I said, we'll have more to say after we wrap up the fourth quarter and provide guidance in our year-end call in early March. Catching up in what regard? Yes. I think overall, we'll have to see how it plays out. I mean, we're still in this burst of economic activity where demand is exceeding supply. I think we have to understand what happens when it's a more -- a greater balance between supply and demand, which we'll see if that's first quarter or second quarter of next year. So it's hard to say at this point. Fire ahead. We'll call Marni later. Yes -- go ahead. And then obviously, I would say the 14% comp helps us leverage the SG&A significantly. Sure, Bob. It's a very competitive market for talent, and we've seen the most competition in our distribution centers. We made some permanent wage increases early this year. We also have some retention and incentives to get us through the peak. We're in really good shape. We've been able to staff up the peak. The distribution centers are where they need to be in the stores. Obviously, we have holiday selling ahead of us. We also have incentive -- hiring incentives there to make sure we can staff up for peak, and we're confident that we're in a good place there as well. Given the competition, we'll remain competitive to make sure that we can -- we'll remain competitive with our pay to make sure we can attract talent, and we feel really good about the workforce right now. On next year, we wouldn't comment. We'll comment again at year-end. On inventory, we typically don't guide ahead on inventory levels. It's really hard because there's a lot of moving parts because it's not only stimulus, it's customer pent-up demand. We'll end up developing plans around it as we move into next year but we haven't quantified that. We wouldn't comment specifically on next year, but we would expect -- I would say generally, we would expect COVID costs to come down. They are not wholly permanently part of the cost. Sure, John. As I said, obviously, we're in a very healthy sector of retail and are confident in our prospects for further market share gains. As we sit here today, it's difficult to predict how much of the inflationary cost headwinds we're experiencing from the burst of economic activity are transitory versus permanent. So margin recovery will be dependent on where and when those costs stabilize. \n And of course, our sales volume, where we once again, we believe we have a long-range, large market share opportunity ahead of us. Over time, we would expect to return to double-digit EPS growth on the 3% to 4% comp. We do have initiatives in the company to try to increase efficiencies in our big areas of expense, including our stores and distribution centers, but it's going to be largely dependent on the transitory nature of the inflation that we're seeing today. Sure. On the real estate front, as we said in our comments, we ended up -- we wrapped up our program for this year. We opened 65 stores. We also said that we expect to return to historical annual program in 2022 of opening 100 stores annually. Overall, the real estate market is good. And we would expect there to be increased supply of available sites, given the level of store closures."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, COVID-related costs and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2020 Form 10-K and fiscal 2021 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that both second quarter sales and earnings substantially exceeded our expectations. Sales benefited from customers' positive response to our broad assortment of great bargains. In addition, our results were bolstered by a number of external factors, including ongoing government stimulus, increasing vaccination rates and diminishing COVID restrictions.  \n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021, grew 22% and to $1.39 on net income of $494 million. This compares to $1.14 per share on net earnings of $413 million for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2019. Total sales for the quarter rose 21% to $4.8 billion with comparable store sales up a robust 15%.  \n For the first 6 months, earnings per share were $2.73, on net earnings of $971 million, up from  $2.29 per share on net income of $834 million for the same period in 2019. Sales for the first half of 2021 rose 20% to $9.3 billion with comparable store sales up 14%. For the second quarter, Ross' sales trends across merchandise areas and regions were fairly broad-based with children's and the Midwest performing the best. Additionally, dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained robust during the period as both sales and operating profit gains significantly exceeded our expectations.  \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 5%, while average selling store inventories were up 3% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 30% of the total compared to 43% for the same period in 2019 as we use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead-of-planned sales. In addition, there were receipt delays due to supply chain congestion.  \n Turning to store growth. We now expect to open approximately 65 total locations this year, comprised of about 45 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. As mentioned in last quarter's call, in 2022, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores.  \n Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further details on our second quarter results, third quarter guidance and updated outlook for the year. \nMichael Hartshorn: Thank you, Barbara. As we previously stated, comparable store sales increased 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by a larger average basket with traffic up slightly versus 2019. Operating margin was well above plan and up versus 2019 at 14.1%. Cost of goods sold decreased by 45 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin and occupancy improved by 80 basis points each, while buying costs declined by 10 basis points. Partially offsetting these items were higher distribution expenses which grew 40 basis points, primarily from wage increases, while worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion drove higher freight costs of 85 basis points.  \n SG&A for the period rose 5 basis points as leverage from strong sales gains was offset by COVID expenses and higher incentives given our better-than-expected second quarter results. Total net COVID-related expenses for the period were approximately 45 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.  \n During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million.  We remain on track to buy back a total of $650 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our third quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections compare to the same period in 2019. \n Looking ahead, there remains much uncertainty on the sustainability of the positive external factors that benefited our first half results as well as the potential risk we could face from the spread of COVID variants and worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion. As a result, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5% to 7% for the third quarter, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. \n The operating statement assumptions that support our third quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 9% to 12%. We expect operating margins to be 7.3% to 7.9%. This forecast reflects significant escalation of freight costs as well as higher distribution expenses. In addition, ongoing COVID-related costs are projected to negatively impact EBIT margin by approximately 45 basis points in the period. \n We plan to open 28 stores during the third quarter, consisting of 18 Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 354 million. Based on our first half results and third quarter guidance, we now project full year comparable store sales gains of 10% to 11% and earnings per share to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.38 compared to $4.60 in 2019. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Michael. While we're pleased by the better-than-expected results we reported today, as Michael noted, there's a high level of uncertainty on a number of external factors and how they may affect our business over the balance of the year. That said, we believe we are well positioned as a value retailer and remain confident in our ability to continue to deliver great branded bargains. \n Moving forward, we remain optimistic about our prospects for continued growth in both sales and profitability over the longer term, especially given consumers' increasing focus on value and convenience. Moreover, the significant number of retail closures and bankruptcies in recent years further enhances our ability to gain additional market share in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: It's quite a different tone with the 2Q beat versus the 3Q guidance. I was just curious, how much of these sales and margin pressures are you seeing today versus how much you're baking in just in case things get worse? \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly (sic) [ Lorraine ], it's Michael. On the sales front, the guidance is really based on the high level of uncertainty and risk that could happen in the third and fourth quarter, and it's really based on the risk that the external factors that benefited the first half, how sustainable those are. And then also with the Delta variant and supply chain congestion, what other risks exist. That said, we hope to do better than the guidance as we have year-to-date thus far. \nOperator: Your next question is from Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: So a lot of focus out there on kind of the cost side of the current kind of supply chain backdrop. I was hoping you could speak to some of the opportunities this is creating or expected to create in the months and quarters ahead just with canceled orders, late deliveries, inventory trapped in nodes throughout the system. Just how do you see this really playing out from an inventory availability standpoint in the coming quarters? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, listen, obviously, the supply chain congestion is causing all kinds of receipt delays right now, and we expect those actually to worsen as the year goes on. So at some point in time, those goods will back up, and we will see those as potentially an opportunity, either for packaway or to flow, depending upon business or what the types of products are. So at this moment, you would think that, that would happen probably either late in the year or the beginning of next year, if I had to pick a time frame. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Can you maybe talk about performance by state? Curious, your 3 big states, how different the performance was in the second quarter? And also curious if there are any states in particular where you might be seeing some sort of change in trend in the third quarter to date that's kind of guiding how you are thinking about comps in 3Q. And I was also curious if you could just talk about home versus apparel performance in the quarter. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the regional performance, so Texas, Florida, California, they make up about 50% of our sales, what we saw during the quarter. Texas and California were relatively in line with the chain. Florida, which trailed in the first quarter, saw a significant improvement as tourism increased, though still a bit below the chain in the second quarter. And we wouldn't comment on current quarter trends at this point. \nBarbara Rentler: And home versus apparel, home continues to be one of our top-performing merchandise areas similar to trends that we've seen throughout the entire pandemic. Apparel, however, continue to accelerate from Q1 to Q2. So I think what we're seeing in apparel is pre-COVID, there was already a shift towards casual wear and then active wear. And what's happening now is that more traditional sportswear classifications have also improved. So that's starting to make -- to build the sales from one quarter to the other. \nPaul Lejuez: Barbara, are you seeing the supply chain disruption impact certain categories more than others? Anything you can share there? \nBarbara Rentler: Look, overall, there's plenty of supply. It's not consistent, to your point, across merchandise departments. But in reality, what's happening is that merchandise deliveries are sliding. So it could slide 2 weeks, 30 days, they're sliding. And so what the merchants are really doing is they are constantly flexing based off of what they're seeing in the market, the availability. And they're chasing into classifications that they need. So it's a little bit of a moving target. But overall, there's plenty of supply. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay, great. I wanted to hear if you've given any further thought to potentially some price actions just to help absorb some of the higher costs, even if it's just a little bit here or there or sort of surgically done based on what comparison prices you're seeing in the marketplace? I just wanted to see if you had thought about that any differently as compared to your comments back in May. And then could I just get a clarification on the full year 10% to 11% comp guidance and what does that embed for the fourth quarter? \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. In terms of pricing, Kimberly, we still strongly believe that price value is critical to our customers. So as you know, we, over the years, talked about how the merchants comp shop regularly. And really, they really understand that our target shopper is really price-savvy. So she's not getting the best deal out there, she knows it. The higher prices at traditional retailers could increase the pricing gap that we offer and strengthen the values that we provide to our shoppers. And quite frankly, the merchants are constantly making those price value assessments of their assortments all the time. They're prioritizing, as we'll always prioritize, really having sharply priced assortments for our entire store. So at this point, I wouldn't talk anything more about it for competitive reasons. But the one comment that I would say is we won't be the leader in terms of raising prices. The merchants will do their job and they'll assess it and they'll price it the way they see it. \nMichael Hartshorn: Kimberly, on comp guidance. The fourth quarter looks very similar to the Q3 at the 5% to 7%. \nOperator: Your next question is from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Just wondering if you guys could speak to the magnitude of the DC and freight costs that you're anticipating in the third quarter. It looks like over the past couple of quarters, it's been about a 100 to 125 basis point drag. Just wondering if you could speak to how big of a drag you're expecting here in this quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: We didn't give specific guidance. In the second quarter, obviously, DCs were 40 basis points of drag and freight was 85 basis points. So we would expect both the DCs and the freight costs to worsen in the back half. Some of that is driven by the leverage on comp. But we would expect -- we've raised wages further in the DCs, and we're seeing specifically ocean freight costs significantly escalate in the back half. So those expectations for worsening are built into the guidance that we gave. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on the nice quarter. So Barbara, any early thoughts on overall back-to-school trends, maybe what you've seen so far in August in some of the states that have gone back earlier? And then, Michael, on gross margin, have you embedded any change in the external promotional or pricing backdrop for the third quarter relative to what we saw in the front half of the year just in your merchandise margin outlook? \nBarbara Rentler: So Matt, the back-to-school trends. Look, we're -- we've been pleased with our younger businesses' performances for a while. And so that obviously bodes well for back to school. In terms of classifications, I would say the customer is still buying wear now but has started to make that conversion to go forward in a more traditional back-to-school fashion that we might have seen from a product perspective in, let's say, 2019. But we feel good about those businesses because, obviously, our younger businesses are doing well. Therefore, back-to-school, we feel pretty good about. \nMichael Hartshorn: And Matt, on margin, obviously, we have built in what we can see today with our current on order. I think our big opportunity as it was in the second quarter is if we can exceed the sales plans there, there should be a benefit as we turn faster and take lower margins. \nOperator: Your next question is from Janine Stichter from Jefferies. \nJanine Stichter: I wanted to ask about the COVID costs, if you had any thoughts about the time line for potentially starting to moderate the expense you're putting into the cleaning and sanitation aspect in the stores? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. I think that's changed over time. Obviously, if you would have asked me that 2 months ago, it would have been sooner than later. But right now, we have the cleaning aspects built in throughout the rest of the year, which we think is appropriate given the variant spread. \nOperator: Your next question is from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Michael, I'm curious, what you think are the biggest opportunities to get the business -- if we try to look beyond a lot of the noise in the margin right now, to get the business back to that kind of 14% plus operating margin that you guys saw a few years back? It sounds like you -- I guess when you look at the pricing commentary in the soft lines group, you seem to think that there's no real urgency here to move towards it. So maybe that implies your thinking that some of these costs we're seeing are quite transitory. Do you -- within that -- if that's right, what do you think are the best ways for this business to get back to that 14-plus operating margin in the past from here? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Michael. As you mentioned, obviously, we have transitory costs in the business right now, whether it's COVID. At some point, there will be some equilibrium in the freight world, especially with ocean freight that we expect to be an opportunity going forward. And then I would say the return to 2019 margin levels will be highly dependent on strong sales performance over time. And given we're in a very vibrant sector of retail, there's market share up for grabs with store closures and bankruptcies and the customer who's focused on value and convenience, we feel good about our opportunities. Now that is not to say that we don't have a lot of work going on in the business to find places to be more efficient to offset some of these costs. But I think it's dependent on how long some of this inflation lasts and then certainly on top line growth. \nOperator: Your next question is from John Kernan from Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Just curious on the quantification of freight and distribution headwinds into next year. Is this -- the impact that you're guiding to in the back half of the year, is that -- ballpark just how we should think about it for the first half of next year? \nMichael Hartshorn: I wouldn't comment on next year at this point. In the DCs, the wages that we've made are permanent. And that said, we do have productivity initiatives that we'll build into our budgets and plans for next year. On the freight cost, I'd say, it's hard to say at this point. If I gave you my view at this point, I think some of the ocean and congestion will bleed into the first part of next year. \nJohn Kernan: Got it. One quick follow-up. Just as we stay on the theme of supply chain here, are you concerned at all about deliveries into holiday in the early part of next year, given some of the things we're seeing at ports, et cetera? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, I think we all know the supply chain problems and it's backed up and all the issues with COVID overseas, which kind of made all of the -- not all, but a large majority of goods coming out of China slide. I think the issues are real, and I think they'll continue for a while. And so what we have to do is really make sure that we're paying attention to what it is and that the merchants are adjusting and flexing based off of what they're seeing and what's happening around them. I mean, the majority of our business is closeout. \n So a lot of these things are a timing issue of how goods will slide, what goods might be late that might be available for us to buy in season. It's kind of like a moving target. I think the challenge as you go into Q1 is that Chinese New Year is a couple of weeks earlier. So those 2 things are going to slide, I think, a little bit in terms of deliveries and the kind of goods that have to get out of China in particular. So I think the answer is we're going to watch it. We're going to adjust as we go. And we're in a flexible business model. So as long as we can offer a treasure hunt and a broad assortment, that's what we're going to do. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I was wondering if you had seen any changes in basket or ATV this quarter versus first quarter. And then toward the end of the quarter, were you seeing any impact in particularly Texas and Florida of maybe the Delta variant on late July trends? I know that for a quarter, they seemed to be fine, but any trailing off at the end of the quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: Adrienne, on the components of comp, it was mainly driven by the size of the basket. Traffic was up slightly. And the basket was driven -- AUR was up slightly, but it was basically driven by units per transaction. And that was a consistent trend with comps throughout the quarter. We wouldn't say specifically the sequential trend other than to say it was fairly robust throughout the quarter. May was slightly higher than the other months in terms of absolute comp. \nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congrats on a great quarter. Could you -- I just want to clarify one thing, Michael, that you said. You said Texas, California and Florida made up what percent of your sales? You guys used to talk about this in the past. I just want to clarify the number that I heard. \nMichael Hartshorn: It's about 50% of it. \nMarni Shapiro: That's what I thought. Can we talk just a little bit about marketing? I know it's not a big ambitious push for you guys like it is for other retailers. So I'm curious just through COVID coming into this year, where was your marketing spend? Has it ticked up through this year as the stores have all now, for the most part, been open? And have you been spending against that? Or has demand been so strong that you haven't ticked up the marketing? And how should we think about it in the back half of the year? If you could just talk a little bit about that. \nMichael Hartshorn: In terms of marketing for competitive reasons, we wouldn't provide the details there, Marni. But we have made strategic investments. We made channel shifts, and we have used -- put more money into places like digital versus broadcast. So we have made some shifts during COVID, and we'll continue to find what works best for us going forward. \nMarni Shapiro: Has it picked up now that the stores are open compared to a year ago when, say, the first half of the year for sure, stores were... \nMichael Hartshorn: No doubt -- yes, Marni, no doubt about it. We -- when the stores were closed, we obviously took that as an opportunity to not spend when the stores were closed. So it certainly has picked up versus last year. \nMarni Shapiro: So that's all rolled back in here. Okay. And it should be about your usual levels then from hereon out with all the stores opened? \nMichael Hartshorn: That's correct. \nOperator: Your next question is from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: Still trying to get my head around the significant decline, almost 50% sequentially in EBIT margins that you're sort of looking to in Q3. I certainly heard the 45 basis point of COVID costs. But are you expecting a big reversal in merchandise margin? Or what are some of the assumptions embedded within that EBIT margin assumption? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the EBIT margin in -- between Q2 and Q3, for instance, obviously, the 5% to 7% comp is lower than our year-to-date performance at 15% in the second quarter. So that drives a significant portion of it. And then as I mentioned, ocean freight costs, where we've embedded the assumption that, that will significantly escalate over Q2, and then we expect the higher wages in the DC to drive a bit more deleverage than we had year-to-date. \nLaura Champine: Got it. Do you have -- can you give me total logistics costs as a percentage of sales sort of normally and where it's tracking now? \nMichael Hartshorn: That's not something we provide. The best guidance I can give you at this point is, again, freight was 85 basis points worse in the second quarter, and we've embedded significantly a escalation from that. And then on the DCs, as I mentioned, it was 40 basis points, and we expect additional deleverage because of higher wages. \nOperator: Your next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory. \nDana Telsey: It seems like for a couple of quarters in a row now, dd's has had terrific performance. Anything to note there? And any changes to their plans in terms of what's driving that? Or is it the child tax credits and stimulus? And then secondly, just on packaway. I think it's 30% this quarter. I think it was 34% in the first quarter. How do you -- how are you thinking about packaway for the balance of the year and the rate it would be at? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Dana. On dd's, as we mentioned, dd's continue to have a robust sales trend and like Ross EBIT margin improvement. I'd say relative to Ross, it's been fairly consistent throughout the pandemic. Obviously, the external stimulus has impacted the dd's customer but also helped the Ross customer as well. The one thing they have in common, though, is that, that customer is very focused on value. And they've been attracted to what we've had in the stores. So no changes that I would note in the second quarter. \n On inventory levels, as you mentioned, packaway was at 30% of our total inventory. With ahead-of-planned sales, we obviously use some of that inventory to fuel some of the sales growth. It was also impacted by receipts, delayed receipts. So within the inventory number, we have a higher level of in transit than we have had historically. And then the return, we would expect to return to historical levels over time, but that's going to be somewhat dependent on how we perform on the top line and whether we beat the plan and then also what supply chain congestion looks like at the end of the year. \nOperator: Your next question is from Simeon Siegel from BMO Capital Markets. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Dick Patient ] on for Simeon. I'm just wondering if you could give some color potentially on where you're seeing the most opportunity to kind of capture that share. If that's with new customers or with expanding the current customer wallet within the current dd's and Ross customers and kind of what you're thinking about that going forward. \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I would say what we've seen during the pandemic is we've seen a younger customer. Part of that early on in the pandemic was driven by the older customer with restrictions and hesitancy to shop. As we moved along, we've seen in the customers that, that older shopper is actually returning back to the store. So I think we have an opportunity across our customer base to the extent that we can provide them the bargains that they've come to expect. \nOperator: Your next question is from Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: Michael, is it possible to quantify for us the magnitude of the worsening of the inflationary pressures that you called out between Q2 and Q3? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes, I would only point to the overall EBIT margin. It's a significant deescalation right now, the 7.3% to 7.9% is [ 450 ] to [ 510 ] versus 2019 of deleverage. So the main drivers out of that are obviously the comp difference between Q2 and Q3. The higher ocean freight is a significant portion of that. And then as I mentioned, the higher distribution expense. I'd say the highest -- the largest single deleverage is coming from ocean freight. \nOperator: Our last question is from Roxanne Meyer from MKM Partners. \nRoxanne Meyer: Congratulations on a solid 2Q. My question is on the merchandise margin. You delivered a very robust game there on top of a sizable gain in the first quarter, and really, on top of a significant increase in merch margin last year. Where is that coming from? Is that being helped by just utilizing packaway? And how should we think about merchandise margin going forward? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. In the quarter, the really -- the upside versus our original expectations and again versus last year is that we've been able to operate in a -- with inventory very close to need. We've operated with lower inventories in stores. We've been able to chase the business. And that has driven faster turns and lower markdowns. What we've done throughout the pandemic is tried to operate very close to need. And we think that we can do that not only during the pandemic, but post-pandemic which will benefit margins in the future. But that -- the lower markdowns and faster turns was the main driver of the margin improvement in the second quarter. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler for her closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the third quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that both second quarter sales and earnings substantially exceeded our expectations.

Sales for the first half of 2021 rose 20% to $9.3 billion with comparable store sales up 14%. For the second quarter, Ross' sales trends across merchandise areas and regions were fairly broad-based with children's and the Midwest performing the best. Additionally, dd's DISCOUNTS trends remained robust during the period as both sales and operating profit gains significantly exceeded our expectations.  \n At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 5%, while average selling store inventories were up 3% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 30% of the total compared to 43% for the same period in 2019 as we use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead-of-planned sales. In addition, there were receipt delays due to supply chain congestion.  \n Turning to store growth. We now expect to open approximately 65 total locations this year, comprised of about 45 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. As mentioned in last quarter's call, in 2022, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores.  \n Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further details on our second quarter results, third quarter guidance and updated outlook for the year. Thank you, Michael. While we're pleased by the better-than-expected results we reported today, as Michael noted, there's a high level of uncertainty on a number of external factors and how they may affect our business over the balance of the year.

And really, they really understand that our target shopper is really price-savvy. So she's not getting the best deal out there, she knows it. The higher prices at traditional retailers could increase the pricing gap that we offer and strengthen the values that we provide to our shoppers. And quite frankly, the merchants are constantly making those price value assessments of their assortments all the time. They're prioritizing, as we'll always prioritize, really having sharply priced assortments for our entire store. So at this point, I wouldn't talk anything more about it for competitive reasons. But the one comment that I would say is we won't be the leader in terms of raising prices. The merchants will do their job and they'll assess it and they'll price it the way they see it. So Matt, the back-to-school trends. Look, we're -- we've been pleased with our younger businesses' performances for a while. And so that obviously bodes well for back to school. In terms of classifications, I would say the customer is still buying wear now but has started to make that conversion to go forward in a more traditional back-to-school fashion that we might have seen from a product perspective in, let's say, 2019. But we feel good about those businesses because, obviously, our younger businesses are doing well. Therefore, back-to-school, we feel pretty good about. Well, I think we all know the supply chain problems and it's backed up and all the issues with COVID overseas, which kind of made all of the -- not all, but a large majority of goods coming out of China slide. I think the issues are real, and I think they'll continue for a while. And so what we have to do is really make sure that we're paying attention to what it is and that the merchants are adjusting and flexing based off of what they're seeing and what's happening around them. I mean, the majority of our business is closeout. \n So a lot of these things are a timing issue of how goods will slide, what goods might be late that might be available for us to buy in season. It's kind of like a moving target. I think the challenge as you go into Q1 is that Chinese New Year is a couple of weeks earlier. So those 2 things are going to slide, I think, a little bit in terms of deliveries and the kind of goods that have to get out of China in particular. So I think the answer is we're going to watch it. We're going to adjust as we go. And we're in a flexible business model. So as long as we can offer a treasure hunt and a broad assortment, that's what we're going to do. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As we previously stated, comparable store sales increased 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by a larger average basket with traffic up slightly versus 2019. Operating margin was well above plan and up versus 2019 at 14.1%. Cost of goods sold decreased by 45 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin and occupancy improved by 80 basis points each, while buying costs declined by 10 basis points. Partially offsetting these items were higher distribution expenses which grew 40 basis points, primarily from wage increases, while worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion drove higher freight costs of 85 basis points.  \n SG&A for the period rose 5 basis points as leverage from strong sales gains was offset by COVID expenses and higher incentives given our better-than-expected second quarter results. Total net COVID-related expenses for the period were approximately 45 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.  \n During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of common stock for a total purchase price of $176 million.  We remain on track to buy back a total of $650 million in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our third quarter guidance. As a reminder, our projections compare to the same period in 2019. \n Looking ahead, there remains much uncertainty on the sustainability of the positive external factors that benefited our first half results as well as the potential risk we could face from the spread of COVID variants and worsening industry-wide supply chain congestion. As a result, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5% to 7% for the third quarter, with earnings per share projected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.69. \n The operating statement assumptions that support our third quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to grow 9% to 12%. We expect operating margins to be 7.3% to 7.9%. This forecast reflects significant escalation of freight costs as well as higher distribution expenses. In addition, ongoing COVID-related costs are projected to negatively impact EBIT margin by approximately 45 basis points in the period. \n We plan to open 28 stores during the third quarter, consisting of 18 Ross and 10 dd's DISCOUNTS. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 354 million. Based on our first half results and third quarter guidance, we now project full year comparable store sales gains of 10% to 11% and earnings per share to be in the range of $4.20 to $4.38 compared to $4.60 in 2019. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Kimberly (sic) [ Lorraine ], it's Michael. On the sales front, the guidance is really based on the high level of uncertainty and risk that could happen in the third and fourth quarter, and it's really based on the risk that the external factors that benefited the first half, how sustainable those are. And then also with the Delta variant and supply chain congestion, what other risks exist. That said, we hope to do better than the guidance as we have year-to-date thus far. On the regional performance, so Texas, Florida, California, they make up about 50% of our sales, what we saw during the quarter. Texas and California were relatively in line with the chain. Florida, which trailed in the first quarter, saw a significant improvement as tourism increased, though still a bit below the chain in the second quarter. And we wouldn't comment on current quarter trends at this point. Kimberly, on comp guidance. The fourth quarter looks very similar to the Q3 at the 5% to 7%. We didn't give specific guidance. In the second quarter, obviously, DCs were 40 basis points of drag and freight was 85 basis points. So we would expect both the DCs and the freight costs to worsen in the back half. Some of that is driven by the leverage on comp. But we would expect -- we've raised wages further in the DCs, and we're seeing specifically ocean freight costs significantly escalate in the back half. So those expectations for worsening are built into the guidance that we gave. And Matt, on margin, obviously, we have built in what we can see today with our current on order. I think our big opportunity as it was in the second quarter is if we can exceed the sales plans there, there should be a benefit as we turn faster and take lower margins. Sure. I think that's changed over time. Obviously, if you would have asked me that 2 months ago, it would have been sooner than later. But right now, we have the cleaning aspects built in throughout the rest of the year, which we think is appropriate given the variant spread. Sure, Michael. As you mentioned, obviously, we have transitory costs in the business right now, whether it's COVID. At some point, there will be some equilibrium in the freight world, especially with ocean freight that we expect to be an opportunity going forward. And then I would say the return to 2019 margin levels will be highly dependent on strong sales performance over time. And given we're in a very vibrant sector of retail, there's market share up for grabs with store closures and bankruptcies and the customer who's focused on value and convenience, we feel good about our opportunities. Now that is not to say that we don't have a lot of work going on in the business to find places to be more efficient to offset some of these costs. But I think it's dependent on how long some of this inflation lasts and then certainly on top line growth. I wouldn't comment on next year at this point. In the DCs, the wages that we've made are permanent. And that said, we do have productivity initiatives that we'll build into our budgets and plans for next year. On the freight cost, I'd say, it's hard to say at this point. If I gave you my view at this point, I think some of the ocean and congestion will bleed into the first part of next year. Adrienne, on the components of comp, it was mainly driven by the size of the basket. Traffic was up slightly. And the basket was driven -- AUR was up slightly, but it was basically driven by units per transaction. And that was a consistent trend with comps throughout the quarter. We wouldn't say specifically the sequential trend other than to say it was fairly robust throughout the quarter. May was slightly higher than the other months in terms of absolute comp. It's about 50% of it. In terms of marketing for competitive reasons, we wouldn't provide the details there, Marni. But we have made strategic investments. We made channel shifts, and we have used -- put more money into places like digital versus broadcast. So we have made some shifts during COVID, and we'll continue to find what works best for us going forward. No doubt -- yes, Marni, no doubt about it. We -- when the stores were closed, we obviously took that as an opportunity to not spend when the stores were closed. So it certainly has picked up versus last year. That's correct. On the EBIT margin in -- between Q2 and Q3, for instance, obviously, the 5% to 7% comp is lower than our year-to-date performance at 15% in the second quarter. So that drives a significant portion of it. And then as I mentioned, ocean freight costs, where we've embedded the assumption that, that will significantly escalate over Q2, and then we expect the higher wages in the DC to drive a bit more deleverage than we had year-to-date. That's not something we provide. The best guidance I can give you at this point is, again, freight was 85 basis points worse in the second quarter, and we've embedded significantly a escalation from that. And then on the DCs, as I mentioned, it was 40 basis points, and we expect additional deleverage because of higher wages. Sure, Dana. On dd's, as we mentioned, dd's continue to have a robust sales trend and like Ross EBIT margin improvement. I'd say relative to Ross, it's been fairly consistent throughout the pandemic. Obviously, the external stimulus has impacted the dd's customer but also helped the Ross customer as well. The one thing they have in common, though, is that, that customer is very focused on value. And they've been attracted to what we've had in the stores. So no changes that I would note in the second quarter. \n On inventory levels, as you mentioned, packaway was at 30% of our total inventory. With ahead-of-planned sales, we obviously use some of that inventory to fuel some of the sales growth. It was also impacted by receipts, delayed receipts. So within the inventory number, we have a higher level of in transit than we have had historically. And then the return, we would expect to return to historical levels over time, but that's going to be somewhat dependent on how we perform on the top line and whether we beat the plan and then also what supply chain congestion looks like at the end of the year. Yes. I would say what we've seen during the pandemic is we've seen a younger customer. Part of that early on in the pandemic was driven by the older customer with restrictions and hesitancy to shop. As we moved along, we've seen in the customers that, that older shopper is actually returning back to the store. So I think we have an opportunity across our customer base to the extent that we can provide them the bargains that they've come to expect. Yes, I would only point to the overall EBIT margin. It's a significant deescalation right now, the 7.3% to 7.9% is [ 450 ] to [ 510 ] versus 2019 of deleverage. So the main drivers out of that are obviously the comp difference between Q2 and Q3. The higher ocean freight is a significant portion of that. And then as I mentioned, the higher distribution expense. I'd say the highest -- the largest single deleverage is coming from ocean freight. Yes. In the quarter, the really -- the upside versus our original expectations and again versus last year is that we've been able to operate in a -- with inventory very close to need. We've operated with lower inventories in stores. We've been able to chase the business. And that has driven faster turns and lower markdowns. What we've done throughout the pandemic is tried to operate very close to need. And we think that we can do that not only during the pandemic, but post-pandemic which will benefit margins in the future. But that -- the lower markdowns and faster turns was the main driver of the margin improvement in the second quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores' First Quarter 2021 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, COVID-related costs and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.\n These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2020 Form 10-K and fiscal 2021 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.  \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, first quarter sales significantly exceeded our expectations as we benefited considerably from a combination of government stimulus payments, ongoing vaccine rollout, easing of COVID restrictions and pent-up consumer demand. In addition, customers responded enthusiastically to the broad assortment of great bargains we offered throughout our stores.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021, grew 17% to $1.34 on net income of $476 million. This compares to $1.15 per share or net earnings of $421 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion with comparable store sales up a robust 13% versus 2019. As previously announced, financial results and guidance throughout fiscal '21 will be compared against fiscal 2019. We believe the significant impact from the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020 and the disruptions caused by COVID-19 throughout last year make this a more relevant basis for comparison.\n For the first quarter, Home was the best-performing major merchandise area, while the Midwest was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS business trends significantly improved during the quarter. Results were far above our expectations with outstanding sales gains and a rebound in operating profits for the period. \n At quarter end, consolidated inventories were down 6% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 34% of the total compared to 44% for the same period in 2019 as we use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales. Average selling store inventories were down 1% relative to 2019. \n As noted in today's release, our Board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2022, with plans to buy back $650 million this year and $850 million in 2022. The reinstatement of our share repurchase program reflects the current strength of our balance sheet, confidence in the company's ability to generate excess cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business and our long-standing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return.\n Turning to store growth. Our 2021 expansion program is unchanged with plans to open approximately 20 total locations comprised of 40 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. As a reminder, our conservative opening plans this year, especially for the spring season, were set in 2020 during the onset of the pandemic when it was impossible to predict when the health crisis would subside.  \n Looking forward to 2022, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores. Now Travis Marquette will provide further details on our first quarter results, second quarter guidance and outlook for the year. \nTravis Marquette: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales increased 13% in the quarter, driven by a larger average basket. While traffic was down slightly compared to 2019, it accelerated significantly relative to the fourth quarter. Operating margin was well above plan at 14.2% compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost of goods sold levered 35 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin was up 85 basis points and occupancy levered by 60. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs of 75 basis points, mainly driven by the ongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion.  \n In addition, distribution expenses grew 25 basis points primarily due to higher wages, while buying costs increased by 10. SG&A for the quarter delevered by 25 basis points, mainly due to the operating expenses associated with the pandemic and higher incentive costs given our better-than-expected first quarter results. Total net COVID-related expenses for the period were approximately 35 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.\n Now let's discuss our guidance. As Barbara just mentioned, our projections compared to the same period in 2019. For the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5% to 7%. Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.89. The operating statement assumptions that support our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 9% to 12%. \n We are projecting operating margin to be 9.2% to 9.9% compared to 13.7% in 2019. This forecast reflects ongoing expense headwinds from increased freight costs and higher wages. In addition, COVID-related expenses are projected to negatively impact EBIT margins by approximately 100 basis points in the period as we return to pre-pandemic store operating standards, while still maintaining many of the extra cleaning routines.  \n We expect to open 30 stores during the second quarter, consisting of 22 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 355 million. For the full year, we are projecting annual comparable store sales gains of 7% to 9% versus 2019 and earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.20.\n Operating statement assumptions that support our fiscal 2021 guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 11% to 13%. We project that operating margin for 2021 will be in the range of 10.7% to 11.2% compared to 13.4% in 2019. The forecasted decline, again, reflects our expectations for continued freight, wage and COVID cost headwinds through the balance of the year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $75 million. \n Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 354 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Travis. To sum up, we're optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year and hope to do better than our forecast. This confidence is based on our recent results and ongoing improvement in the macroeconomic environment bolstered by vaccine rollouts and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. That said, it's difficult to predict the lasting impact from the factors that benefited our first quarter sales results, especially the recent government stimulus payments. \n As always, we'll remain nimble to address the dynamic consumer and retail landscape, while staying focused on delivering the great bargains our customer has come to expect from us. Longer term, we remain confident about our opportunity to gain market share as we expect to benefit significantly from a favorable competitive climate given the large number of retail store closures and bankruptcies in recent years. \n This, along with the consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience bodes well for our ability to achieve solid results into the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And congrats on the really strong improvement. So Barbara, maybe could you speak to the cadence of business and any notable changes in traffic or category demand as the quarter progressed? And then Travis, on gross margin. I guess maybe just how best to think about the puts and takes in the second quarter that you're embedding relative to 2019? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure, Matthew. So let's start with category demand. There was really broad-based acceleration across all merchandise areas, with obviously Home having very strong performance for Ross and for other people across the country. But what we did see is a major improvement in apparel. And as we feel as the economy starts to open up, that apparel will continue to strengthen as time goes on. With a lot of change in trends, we're monitoring that. We're flexing and moving the business around based off of what the customer is telling us. So we feel -- in totality, we feel overall pretty good about the business going forward. \n In terms of traffic, Travis, do you want to take the traffic piece? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. Yes, just let me break down comp a little bit. I mentioned comp was 13%. It was driven by larger average basket size. That was partially offset by lower number of transactions. Traffic was down slightly compared to 2019, but it accelerated significantly compared to the fourth quarter. The increase in the average basket was driven by items per transaction as average unit retail was up slightly. And then I think your next question was around just the guidance, the operating margin guidance for Q2? \nMatthew Boss: Yes. Just any puts and takes on the second quarter. \nTravis Marquette: Yes. I mean second quarter, again, we -- the overall guidance reflects a couple of things. One, obviously, the comp store gain is expected to be lower than what we saw in the first quarter, and therefore, we'll get a little bit less leverage on the business. \n In addition, on COVID costs, we expect to also be higher, although that will primarily impact SG&A. We also expect to see continued significant pressure on freight. We saw that in the first quarter, both in ocean freight as well as overall freight, and we think that will -- those pressures will continue. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Altschwager from Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I appreciate all the detailed guidance. I guess, overall, if I have all the numbers down correctly, I think the guide implies EBIT margins down about 250 basis points this year versus 2019. Could you characterize that? I mean how much of the step down is related to the COVID cost, which are hopefully temporary versus some of the more kind of pressures on freight and wages that could persist moving forward? Just trying to think about how that EBIT margin might progress as we move beyond this year. \nMichael Hartshorn: Mark, it's Michael Hartshorn. We're obviously optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year, and we hope to do better than our sales and margin forecast. We do expect expense headwinds through the balance of the year. And if you break down the COVID cost at some point, those will not continue, but we expect them to be in place. Our guidance assumes that they're in place throughout the year. \n Wage cost, we would expect, to persist. And at some point, freight, we would expect to persist throughout the year, and we'll see how that balances out over the coming years. But overall, the recovery to 2019 margin levels, it's highly dependent on strong sales performance. And over time, and again, the persistence of the cost inflation we're seeing today, especially in things like freight. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Let me add my congratulations on the top line improvement. Barbara, my first question is for you on the merchandise margin of up 85 basis points. I just want to make sure that, that is separate and aside. So you don't have inbound freight in that number because obviously, we got a separate number for total freight. So that's number one. \n And then can you give us the components of AUR versus AUC on that? I'm imagining your AUR is up meaningfully. Are you getting a relative pricing umbrella from frontline, meaning that if you're 20% to 60% off frontline and frontline's clean, that you're able to maybe clear at a higher price? \n And lastly, was mix from Home versus apparel, did Home grow faster? And was that an impact on the merchandise margin? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. This is Travis. Let me just take a couple of those that you mentioned. One, just in terms of what's included in merchandise margin, when we say inbound freight, ocean freight is included in that number. And so that's embedded. And we had mentioned previously that we expected meaningful headwinds from ocean freight, and we saw those and expect those to continue as we move through the year. \n And then I think you also had a question about apparel versus non-apparel and sort of the mix. We saw broad-based improvements across the store. But non-apparel Home continued to be the strongest category, but we definitely saw an improvement in apparel as well as we move through the quarter. \nMichael Hartshorn: And then, Adrienne, on AUR. AUR was up slightly during the quarter. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. All right. Great. And this is -- go ahead. \nBarbara Rentler: Just relative -- the other part that you're asking about is relative to department stores. because they promoted less than AURs up, the pricing umbrella. Yes. So our AUR is up slightly. But compared -- so that is just -- we just offered a greater value to department store pricing at this point in time. The price value equation is the business that we're in, the relativity to it. But at this moment, our price values are actually stronger than they normally would be to department stores. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. Great. And if I may, just on hourly payroll. I don't really know how to answer it because I know these are sensitive numbers. But if we were to look at freight as a percent of sales, and now I'm talking about the outbound freight because now I know that the inbound freight's inside the merch margin, that line, that deleveraged 75 basis points versus the line item that is wage or hourly payroll, what would be the sort of order of magnitude? Like is the payroll line 3x as much as the freight line or something like that? \n Just so mentally, I can understand like if one of them is moving materially higher than the other, which has the bigger impact on the P&L? \nMichael Hartshorn: Adrienne, Michael Hartshorn again. We wouldn't give you specifics other than what we provided in the guidance other than to say both freight and wages, first on freight, given the robust overall economic rebound, there continues to be significant supply chain congestion and costs have increased versus our original expectations. And so our current guidance assumes additional escalation as we move through the year. \n On wages, that also remains very dynamic. We've made market-by-market adjustments in our stores as we always have to attract talent. Warehousing labor is very competitive, and we've made additional adjustments in all of our distribution centers, and that's also reflected in our guidance. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. Barbara, obviously, the prudent planning for sales going forward, a very conservative plan compared to the very robust first quarter, that seems very, very prudent to us. \n I'm wondering, are you seeing any slowdown so far here in the second quarter that's sort of underscoring your desire to plan more conservatively? Or are you just looking forward and say, okay, there were some really sort of onetime benefit as it were that happened here in the first quarter. So it's just naturally prudent for us to plan more conservatively? \nBarbara Rentler: Kimberly, I think we're thinking more about the first quarter and the lasting impact from some of those factors, the stimulus payments that were out there and what does that really mean as we go forward. So we're comfortable with the number of where we sit today. But that's really some of those pent-up demand, some of those things that we're not sure how that goes forward with completely at this point. \nKimberly Greenberger: Yes. I know it's a very uncertain path forward. Michael, you talked about -- you've got a plan this year for COVID cost to basically continue through the year. So I'm wondering if you can just sort of isolate the COVID costs and based on what you experienced here in the first quarter and then whatever you've got in your forecast for the second, third and fourth quarter, could you just give us a rough dollar amount of what you're budgeting this year for COVID cost? And would it be fair to assume that those costs would roll off in future years? \nTravis Marquette: Kimberly, this is Travis. Let me just kind of do a little bit of a reset remind folks kind of how we talk about COVID costs. We report COVID costs as net, which is to say that they include pandemic-related increases in cost for things like personal protective equipment, extra cleaning, but there are offsets within that number as well for cost savings that we took for things like travel and when we closed our fitting rooms. \n As the pandemic subsides, apparel is becoming more important, we think it's important to take some actions, including reopening our fitting rooms, which is going to eliminate some of the cost savings that we had before, and it drives up the overall COVID cost number. \n For Q1, as we reported, the COVID costs were about 35 basis points on the quarter. For Q2 and going forward, we're estimating those that they will be around 100 basis points for the balance of the year. Again, that assumes where we are today that we have not removed and we -- not built in to the plan to remove any of the additional cleaning activities and protocols that we put into place. \n Having said that, we will continue to monitor guidance from the CDC and other health experts. We'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and our customers. But to the extent that, that guidance changes, then we'll -- we could reevaluate some of those protocols and adjust those plans. \nMichael Hartshorn: And Kimberly, to answer your question on how long they last, those costs are not permanent. So as the pandemic resides, those costs would come back out of the business. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great quarter. My question is just on the first quarter. You originally guided to comps down 1% to 5% and you far exceeded that up 13. Just curious if you guys could just unpack the outperformance, either by category, how much you think was stimulus? I just wanted to ask that question. \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Probably... \nTravis Marquette: Yes. There's -- no go ahead, Barbara. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. So if you're talking about by merchandise category? Is that what... \nCharles Grom: Oh, yes. If we could just -- yes. \nBarbara Rentler: So we'll start there. So it was very broad-based. Obviously, Home is accelerated for everyone, and we still feel very good about Home as we go forward. But the additional acceleration really came out of -- really came out of apparel, and that was also very broad-based as the customer kind of came from just wearing activewear, moving into more real, what I would call, real apparel or even those casual, but still broader classifications of products. So -- and that was broad-based. And so that's why we feel good about apparel as we go forward. \nMichael Hartshorn: And then just overall in the quarter, there's -- as Barbara mentioned in her opening comments, there are a number of factors that led to the increase. Obviously, the stimulus, very difficult to put a number on $400 billion of stimulus to the consumer that continues. We'll continue federal stimulus. There's also states that have stimulus, so that will continue through the second quarter, if not throughout the year with some of the child credits. \n There is the vaccine ramping up. And so customers are becoming more and more confident returning to brick-and-mortar stores. We expect that to continue as the vaccination rates increase. If you look at our regional performance, as we said in the commentary, Midwest was the top-performing region. Of our biggest states, California performance improved significantly versus the prior quarter as government restrictions eased and its comp was relatively similar to the chain -- same average. So there's a lot of different factors driving the comp in the first quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Barbara, could you discuss the availability of product in the better trending categories? And then do you think there's sufficient availability for you to start rebuilding your packaway balances into the back half? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Availability in the better trending businesses, I would say, overall, the availability is there to chase. We have a large merchant team, and so they're out there looking for the goods constantly. I think there's 2 things about it. One is the trends are shifting. in front of us. So things are moving very, very quickly. So I should start with that. And the trends towards just say, like active apparel to other parts of sportswear are shifting quickly. And so far, I would say, yes, we have been able to chase the business, get what we need, get the availability if that's out there. It's more getting the combination of kind of getting ahead of the trend that as it's shifting in the outside world that we're shifting with it and that we get ahead of it. \n But yes, I feel comfortable that the availability is there in the businesses that the customer wants at this moment in time. And then say it again, Lorraine, what was the second question? \nLorraine Maikis: I just wondering how you expected packaway to evolve over the coming quarters if there's sufficient availability for you to be able to rebuild that? \nBarbara Rentler: We think we'll build packaway over time, closer to historical levels. But I do think it will take time as we are very much chasing the business. And if that chase were to continue, I think it would take us a little bit of time because packaway fluctuates also, it's not only that the availability is there. It's that it's the right product, the right value, the right -- it has to have all the right metrics to be going into packaway at the same time. \n So I do think it will take a little bit of time, but there is sufficient availability to be driving our business and to buy packaway and the total picture. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Just a quick one for Travis. Just on the freight headwind you gave us for Q1. Just curious, should we assume that, that should be run rated through the rest of the year? Or should that cost headwind that you have potentially moderate based on the contracts you guys have? \nMichael Hartshorn: Ike, it's Michael. I'll take that. First, the -- even the contracted rates were significantly higher than 2019 levels. In addition, like other retailers, we're incurring higher cost to move freight really both internationally and domestically, we're spending -- we have higher cost to land freight when expected. \n So given the robust overall economic rebound, As I said earlier in the call, we expect freight to -- cost to escalate for the remainder of the year, and that's included in our guidance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: I guess 2 quick ones. We see the sales guidance. I appreciate the conservatism. I think it's been the right move through the year here and with the visibility where it is. But if sales trends do remain strong, as strong as they were in 1Q relative to what you thought, a pretty significant upside sales scenario. Can you tell us how to think about sales flow through in the model relative to the framework you've told us about in the past?\n And then, Barb, just a comment you made earlier, why not extend the relative value back up to the normal rate relative to the department stores. Why hold it lower if they're moving higher just so we can think alongside you on that? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Listen, department stores didn't promote as much for the first time in a very long time. And so I think we'd have to see what that looks like because they're promotional cadence. They've promoted for years and years, and years. So we've had one quarter under their belt where the AUR is probably higher and they haven't promoted. I think we have to see what happens in the future. \n And also, I think it's important while we can get great value to the customer, price value is absolutely critical to our customer. And so we're going to value the goods the way we think the customer expects them -- where the customer expects them to be. \n And so raising the AUR and changing your value equation is a very delicate thing. And so I think having one quarter underneath our belt with lots of money stimulus and lots of things going on in there, driving sales. I think it's a very, very much, remains to be seen, and it is very important in off-price and critical in our business model to offer that price value. The customer is very savvy and shopping all the time. \n So again, not sustained yet and department stores don't know how that's really going to land. And then with all the money in the stimulus out there, I don't know how to take that as a go-forward strategy to read at this moment in time. \nTravis Marquette: And this is Travis. In terms of the operating margin flow-through on above sales above plan, we continue to expect comp outperformance to drive increased operating margin flow-through compared to the guidance that we've provided. But I don't think we would necessarily expect it to be quite as strong as we saw in Q1, but we do expect operating margin improvements as comp exceeds our plans. \nMichael Hartshorn: And then the flow-through on this guidance would look like it has historically. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congrats. And Barbara, the department stores. We all know where they're going. They're going right back to promotions. If you could give me a little bit of guidance around your traffic during the quarter and what you're seeing around things like schools reopened, the Easter holiday. Did you see a pop around when the stimulus checks pop -- came into hand or around Mother's Day? Just trying to get a feeling about the cadence of the traffic, if it's in every day? Or is she also being sparked to come into store by events? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. This is Travis. I can talk a bit about just trends. Again, generally, we don't provide sort of detailed traffic trends by month. But given the timing of tax refunds and stimulus payments, you can imagine that sales were stronger later in the quarter than at the beginning. In terms of traffic trends, again, traffic for us is transactions, it mirrors pretty close to our sales trends. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: To the previous point, Travis, when you guys set the guidance for Q2 sales, did you just take the trend before the stimulus and extrapolate that there? Or how did you -- what was the basis of that Q2 sales guide? \nTravis Marquette: The comp sales guide? No, again, I think Michael, we've talked about it, there are a number of factors that drove the Q1 performance, be it stimulus, pent-up demand, vaccine rollouts, et cetera. And it's difficult to precisely predict how long some of those will last. And so we took that into account and projected forward what we think is our current plan and best guess for Q2, and we certainly hope to do better. \nLaura Champine: Got it. In the back half related to that, is there anything in your expectations for the benefit from the enhanced child tax credit? And historically, when this sort of stimulus has come through, do you see it in your numbers? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, I would say it's hard to say at this point. We've not seen this type of stimulus even in the first quarter in a very long time. As Travis said, we set a baseline, and we clearly hope we can do better than these -- the guidance that we put out. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jay Sole from UBS. \nJay Sole: Great. My question is about the full year guidance, specifically about the fourth quarter. When we get to the fourth quarter and get to January, we'll be lapping the stimulus that happened in January. How are you thinking about what impact that might have on the business in the fourth quarter? And how might fourth quarter sales and gross margin compared to what we saw this past year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I think we'll provide guidance as we move through the year. Right now, we typically provide guidance quarter-by-quarter. So we'll have more to say as we move through the year on the fourth quarter. \nJay Sole: Would you think that January sales will be down year-over-year? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't comment at this point. \nJay Sole: Got it. Okay. Well, then maybe if I can ask one more. Are you still seeing right now the impacts of stimulus? Is there any way to measure whether whatever you're seeing in May is sort of still a tailwind from the stimulus that was distributed in March and April? Or is now some other factor become a bigger driver here in May? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. We wouldn't -- as Barbara said at the beginning, we don't comment on -- it's our practice not to comment on intra-quarter trends. I can tell you, certainly in the first quarter, we think stimulus had a significant impact among other factors that we called out earlier. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: This is Krisztina Katai on for Paul. I just wanted to add my congrats on a great quarter. I wanted to circle back to merchandise margin and the strength that has been there for the last 3 quarters. How do you see the current environment evolving from just a buying perspective? And can you just speak to the sustainability of these trends to potentially drive pre-COVID gross profit margins if you essentially maintain these strong sales trends? \nTravis Marquette: Yes. In terms of the merchandise margin, again, the buying environment remains very dynamic. Margins will vary significantly based on our overall sales performance. We've talked, over the last several quarters, that the buying environment has been quite strong, and we benefited from that. Obviously, in the first quarter, we also benefited from significant above plan sales, which drove faster turns and fewer markdowns. So those were all positive. \n In terms of how long that sustains, we'll see. I mean we have our best guess built into the guidance, and we obviously hope to do better. And the extent we do, we'd expect to see some further benefit. \nKrisztina Katai: Got it. That's helpful. And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more what you're seeing as it relates to just general consumer willingness to return to your stores. Do you have any data on this? What portion of your pre-pandemic shoppers have returned to shop with you regularly? And are you seeing any demographic changes, perhaps older consumers are returning to your stores as vaccines are being rolled out here relatively quickly? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the consumer, what we are seeing is the consumer -- we've seen our consumer shop less, but they are buying more during their shopping trips the demographics of our customer base did skew younger during the peak of the pandemic given older customers hesitancy to shop in brick-and-mortar stores. We believe customers of all ages are returning to stores with the increased vaccination rates, and that's especially true with older customers where the vaccination rates are much higher. \n Overall, we know that she continues to prioritize value and convenience when deciding where to shop. And with the large number of retail closures, she obviously has fewer places to stop now. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citi. \nTracy Kogan: It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I had 2 questions. I was hoping, first, you could talk about the marketing spend in the quarter and whether you've leveraged that spend and what your expectations are for the year? And then, secondly, can you talk about the rent deals that you saw, I guess, for the deals you signed last year for the openings this year, and how that's trended as you're signing new deals right now? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the leases, the real estate market is good, both from a supply standpoint and what we're seeing in leases. I wouldn't say specifically on a call like this, but the significance of the rent favorability given the number of leases across the whole chain would not be significant on an overall leverage, for instance on sales. On marketing, for us, marketing continues to be a good reminder to our customers. Overall, our strategic investment here, it has been to move to more digital. I wouldn't provide more specifics on marketing on this call. \nTracy Kogan: Just going back to the real estate, any changes from what you were seeing last year versus this year, in terms of favorability? Is it getting better or worse? \nMichael Hartshorn: I'd say the story is still developing, Tracy. So we'll see how it develops over the next couple of years. Obviously, the availability is good, and we hope to take advantage of that given all the store closures. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Nice to see the progress. It was mentioned about dd's in the release, and I think a little bit at the beginning, what are you seeing in dd's? It sounds like it took an upturn for the better, both in terms of sales and operating profits. And anything to note there on store openings of dd's versus Ross and what you're seeing either in terms of favorability of leases, and also productivity this year to last -- this year to LLY? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, I would say that the story is very similar for dd's. We did see strong gains in sales and operating profits for the period versus our expectations. I would also say that dd's has the similar wage, freight and COVID cost expense pressures that we're seeing in Ross. And I would say we feel really good about dd's performance. \nTravis Marquette: In terms of new store productivity, we don't break out dd's specifically, but overall, new store productivity continues to be in the 60% to 65% range that we've talked about historically. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the real estate rollout, we would expect to beyond this year, dd's -- grow dd's at 20 to 25 stores per year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta from Barclays. \nPriya Ohri-Gupta: Great. I was hoping you could update us on your thoughts as to potentially continuing to bring down your debt balance given your -- where the cash balance currently stands? And any further thoughts on improving the balance sheet? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. Our expectation is that we're going to pay down our existing debt. So we're not going to refinance it. The timing, if it's economically advantageous to pay off early, we would consider it. But If not, we would expect to pay off our existing debt at maturity. \nOperator: That was our last question. I will turn the call over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Travis Marquette, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.  \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, first quarter sales significantly exceeded our expectations as we benefited considerably from a combination of government stimulus payments, ongoing vaccine rollout, easing of COVID restrictions and pent-up consumer demand. In addition, customers responded enthusiastically to the broad assortment of great bargains we offered throughout our stores.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021, grew 17% to $1.34 on net income of $476 million. This compares to $1.15 per share or net earnings of $421 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2019. Total sales for the quarter were $4.5 billion with comparable store sales up a robust 13% versus 2019. As previously announced, financial results and guidance throughout fiscal '21 will be compared against fiscal 2019. We believe the significant impact from the extended closure of our operations in the spring of 2020 and the disruptions caused by COVID-19 throughout last year make this a more relevant basis for comparison.\n For the first quarter, Home was the best-performing major merchandise area, while the Midwest was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS business trends significantly improved during the quarter. Results were far above our expectations with outstanding sales gains and a rebound in operating profits for the period. \n At quarter end, consolidated inventories were down 6% versus 2019. Packaway levels ended at 34% of the total compared to 44% for the same period in 2019 as we use a substantial amount of packaway merchandise to support ahead of planned sales. Average selling store inventories were down 1% relative to 2019. \n As noted in today's release, our Board authorized a new program to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock through fiscal 2022, with plans to buy back $650 million this year and $850 million in 2022. The reinstatement of our share repurchase program reflects the current strength of our balance sheet, confidence in the company's ability to generate excess cash after funding growth and other capital needs of the business and our long-standing commitment to enhancing stockholder value and return.\n Turning to store growth. Our 2021 expansion program is unchanged with plans to open approximately 20 total locations comprised of 40 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. As a reminder, our conservative opening plans this year, especially for the spring season, were set in 2020 during the onset of the pandemic when it was impossible to predict when the health crisis would subside.  \n Looking forward to 2022, we expect to return to our normal annual opening program of approximately 100 new stores. Now Travis Marquette will provide further details on our first quarter results, second quarter guidance and outlook for the year. Thank you, Travis. To sum up, we're optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year and hope to do better than our forecast. This confidence is based on our recent results and ongoing improvement in the macroeconomic environment bolstered by vaccine rollouts and the easing of pandemic-related restrictions. That said, it's difficult to predict the lasting impact from the factors that benefited our first quarter sales results, especially the recent government stimulus payments. \n As always, we'll remain nimble to address the dynamic consumer and retail landscape, while staying focused on delivering the great bargains our customer has come to expect from us. Longer term, we remain confident about our opportunity to gain market share as we expect to benefit significantly from a favorable competitive climate given the large number of retail store closures and bankruptcies in recent years. \n This, along with the consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience bodes well for our ability to achieve solid results into the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. Sure, Matthew. So let's start with category demand. There was really broad-based acceleration across all merchandise areas, with obviously Home having very strong performance for Ross and for other people across the country. But what we did see is a major improvement in apparel. And as we feel as the economy starts to open up, that apparel will continue to strengthen as time goes on. With a lot of change in trends, we're monitoring that. We're flexing and moving the business around based off of what the customer is telling us. So we feel -- in totality, we feel overall pretty good about the business going forward. \n In terms of traffic, Travis, do you want to take the traffic piece? Just relative -- the other part that you're asking about is relative to department stores. because they promoted less than AURs up, the pricing umbrella. Yes. So our AUR is up slightly. But compared -- so that is just -- we just offered a greater value to department store pricing at this point in time. The price value equation is the business that we're in, the relativity to it. But at this moment, our price values are actually stronger than they normally would be to department stores. Kimberly, I think we're thinking more about the first quarter and the lasting impact from some of those factors, the stimulus payments that were out there and what does that really mean as we go forward. So we're comfortable with the number of where we sit today. But that's really some of those pent-up demand, some of those things that we're not sure how that goes forward with completely at this point. Yes. Probably... Okay. So if you're talking about by merchandise category? Is that what... So we'll start there. So it was very broad-based. Obviously, Home is accelerated for everyone, and we still feel very good about Home as we go forward. But the additional acceleration really came out of -- really came out of apparel, and that was also very broad-based as the customer kind of came from just wearing activewear, moving into more real, what I would call, real apparel or even those casual, but still broader classifications of products. So -- and that was broad-based. And so that's why we feel good about apparel as we go forward. Sure. Availability in the better trending businesses, I would say, overall, the availability is there to chase. We have a large merchant team, and so they're out there looking for the goods constantly. I think there's 2 things about it. One is the trends are shifting. in front of us. So things are moving very, very quickly. So I should start with that. And the trends towards just say, like active apparel to other parts of sportswear are shifting quickly. And so far, I would say, yes, we have been able to chase the business, get what we need, get the availability if that's out there. It's more getting the combination of kind of getting ahead of the trend that as it's shifting in the outside world that we're shifting with it and that we get ahead of it. \n But yes, I feel comfortable that the availability is there in the businesses that the customer wants at this moment in time. And then say it again, Lorraine, what was the second question? We think we'll build packaway over time, closer to historical levels. But I do think it will take time as we are very much chasing the business. And if that chase were to continue, I think it would take us a little bit of time because packaway fluctuates also, it's not only that the availability is there. It's that it's the right product, the right value, the right -- it has to have all the right metrics to be going into packaway at the same time. \n So I do think it will take a little bit of time, but there is sufficient availability to be driving our business and to buy packaway and the total picture. Sure. Listen, department stores didn't promote as much for the first time in a very long time. And so I think we'd have to see what that looks like because they're promotional cadence. They've promoted for years and years, and years. So we've had one quarter under their belt where the AUR is probably higher and they haven't promoted. I think we have to see what happens in the future. \n And also, I think it's important while we can get great value to the customer, price value is absolutely critical to our customer. And so we're going to value the goods the way we think the customer expects them -- where the customer expects them to be. \n And so raising the AUR and changing your value equation is a very delicate thing. And so I think having one quarter underneath our belt with lots of money stimulus and lots of things going on in there, driving sales. I think it's a very, very much, remains to be seen, and it is very important in off-price and critical in our business model to offer that price value. The customer is very savvy and shopping all the time. \n So again, not sustained yet and department stores don't know how that's really going to land. And then with all the money in the stimulus out there, I don't know how to take that as a go-forward strategy to read at this moment in time. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a good day."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Mark, it's Michael Hartshorn. We're obviously optimistic about our prospects for the balance of the year, and we hope to do better than our sales and margin forecast. We do expect expense headwinds through the balance of the year. And if you break down the COVID cost at some point, those will not continue, but we expect them to be in place. Our guidance assumes that they're in place throughout the year. \n Wage cost, we would expect, to persist. And at some point, freight, we would expect to persist throughout the year, and we'll see how that balances out over the coming years. But overall, the recovery to 2019 margin levels, it's highly dependent on strong sales performance. And over time, and again, the persistence of the cost inflation we're seeing today, especially in things like freight. And then, Adrienne, on AUR. AUR was up slightly during the quarter. Adrienne, Michael Hartshorn again. We wouldn't give you specifics other than what we provided in the guidance other than to say both freight and wages, first on freight, given the robust overall economic rebound, there continues to be significant supply chain congestion and costs have increased versus our original expectations. And so our current guidance assumes additional escalation as we move through the year. \n On wages, that also remains very dynamic. We've made market-by-market adjustments in our stores as we always have to attract talent. Warehousing labor is very competitive, and we've made additional adjustments in all of our distribution centers, and that's also reflected in our guidance. And Kimberly, to answer your question on how long they last, those costs are not permanent. So as the pandemic resides, those costs would come back out of the business. And then just overall in the quarter, there's -- as Barbara mentioned in her opening comments, there are a number of factors that led to the increase. Obviously, the stimulus, very difficult to put a number on $400 billion of stimulus to the consumer that continues. We'll continue federal stimulus. There's also states that have stimulus, so that will continue through the second quarter, if not throughout the year with some of the child credits. \n There is the vaccine ramping up. And so customers are becoming more and more confident returning to brick-and-mortar stores. We expect that to continue as the vaccination rates increase. If you look at our regional performance, as we said in the commentary, Midwest was the top-performing region. Of our biggest states, California performance improved significantly versus the prior quarter as government restrictions eased and its comp was relatively similar to the chain -- same average.

In addition, like other retailers, we're incurring higher cost to move freight really both internationally and domestically, we're spending -- we have higher cost to land freight when expected. \n So given the robust overall economic rebound, As I said earlier in the call, we expect freight to -- cost to escalate for the remainder of the year, and that's included in our guidance. And then the flow-through on this guidance would look like it has historically. Well, I would say it's hard to say at this point. We've not seen this type of stimulus even in the first quarter in a very long time. As Travis said, we set a baseline, and we clearly hope we can do better than these -- the guidance that we put out. Yes. I think we'll provide guidance as we move through the year. Right now, we typically provide guidance quarter-by-quarter. So we'll have more to say as we move through the year on the fourth quarter. We wouldn't comment at this point. Yes. We wouldn't -- as Barbara said at the beginning, we don't comment on -- it's our practice not to comment on intra-quarter trends. I can tell you, certainly in the first quarter, we think stimulus had a significant impact among other factors that we called out earlier. On the consumer, what we are seeing is the consumer -- we've seen our consumer shop less, but they are buying more during their shopping trips the demographics of our customer base did skew younger during the peak of the pandemic given older customers hesitancy to shop in brick-and-mortar stores.

            "name": "Travis Marquette",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales increased 13% in the quarter, driven by a larger average basket. While traffic was down slightly compared to 2019, it accelerated significantly relative to the fourth quarter. Operating margin was well above plan at 14.2% compared to 14.1% for the same period in 2019. Cost of goods sold levered 35 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin was up 85 basis points and occupancy levered by 60. These improvements were partially offset by higher freight costs of 75 basis points, mainly driven by the ongoing industry-wide supply chain congestion.  \n In addition, distribution expenses grew 25 basis points primarily due to higher wages, while buying costs increased by 10. SG&A for the quarter delevered by 25 basis points, mainly due to the operating expenses associated with the pandemic and higher incentive costs given our better-than-expected first quarter results. Total net COVID-related expenses for the period were approximately 35 basis points, the vast majority of which impacted SG&A.\n Now let's discuss our guidance. As Barbara just mentioned, our projections compared to the same period in 2019. For the 13 weeks ended July 31, 2021, we are forecasting comparable store sales to be up 5% to 7%. Earnings per share for the second quarter are projected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.89. The operating statement assumptions that support our second quarter guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 9% to 12%. \n We are projecting operating margin to be 9.2% to 9.9% compared to 13.7% in 2019. This forecast reflects ongoing expense headwinds from increased freight costs and higher wages. In addition, COVID-related expenses are projected to negatively impact EBIT margins by approximately 100 basis points in the period as we return to pre-pandemic store operating standards, while still maintaining many of the extra cleaning routines.  \n We expect to open 30 stores during the second quarter, consisting of 22 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $19 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 355 million. For the full year, we are projecting annual comparable store sales gains of 7% to 9% versus 2019 and earnings per share of $3.93 to $4.20.\n Operating statement assumptions that support our fiscal 2021 guidance include the following: total sales are projected to grow 11% to 13%. We project that operating margin for 2021 will be in the range of 10.7% to 11.2% compared to 13.4% in 2019. The forecasted decline, again, reflects our expectations for continued freight, wage and COVID cost headwinds through the balance of the year. Net interest expense is estimated to be about $75 million. \n Our tax rate is projected to be approximately 24% to 25%, and we expect average diluted shares outstanding to be about 354 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes. Yes, just let me break down comp a little bit. I mentioned comp was 13%. It was driven by larger average basket size. That was partially offset by lower number of transactions. Traffic was down slightly compared to 2019, but it accelerated significantly compared to the fourth quarter. The increase in the average basket was driven by items per transaction as average unit retail was up slightly. And then I think your next question was around just the guidance, the operating margin guidance for Q2? Yes. I mean second quarter, again, we -- the overall guidance reflects a couple of things. One, obviously, the comp store gain is expected to be lower than what we saw in the first quarter, and therefore, we'll get a little bit less leverage on the business. \n In addition, on COVID costs, we expect to also be higher, although that will primarily impact SG&A. We also expect to see continued significant pressure on freight. We saw that in the first quarter, both in ocean freight as well as overall freight, and we think that will -- those pressures will continue. Yes. This is Travis. Let me just take a couple of those that you mentioned. One, just in terms of what's included in merchandise margin, when we say inbound freight, ocean freight is included in that number. And so that's embedded. And we had mentioned previously that we expected meaningful headwinds from ocean freight, and we saw those and expect those to continue as we move through the year. \n And then I think you also had a question about apparel versus non-apparel and sort of the mix. We saw broad-based improvements across the store. But non-apparel Home continued to be the strongest category, but we definitely saw an improvement in apparel as well as we move through the quarter. Kimberly, this is Travis. Let me just kind of do a little bit of a reset remind folks kind of how we talk about COVID costs. We report COVID costs as net, which is to say that they include pandemic-related increases in cost for things like personal protective equipment, extra cleaning, but there are offsets within that number as well for cost savings that we took for things like travel and when we closed our fitting rooms. \n As the pandemic subsides, apparel is becoming more important, we think it's important to take some actions, including reopening our fitting rooms, which is going to eliminate some of the cost savings that we had before, and it drives up the overall COVID cost number. \n For Q1, as we reported, the COVID costs were about 35 basis points on the quarter. For Q2 and going forward, we're estimating those that they will be around 100 basis points for the balance of the year. Again, that assumes where we are today that we have not removed and we -- not built in to the plan to remove any of the additional cleaning activities and protocols that we put into place. \n Having said that, we will continue to monitor guidance from the CDC and other health experts. We'll continue to prioritize the health and safety of our associates and our customers. But to the extent that, that guidance changes, then we'll -- we could reevaluate some of those protocols and adjust those plans. Yes. There's -- no go ahead, Barbara. And this is Travis. In terms of the operating margin flow-through on above sales above plan, we continue to expect comp outperformance to drive increased operating margin flow-through compared to the guidance that we've provided. But I don't think we would necessarily expect it to be quite as strong as we saw in Q1, but we do expect operating margin improvements as comp exceeds our plans. Yes. This is Travis. I can talk a bit about just trends. Again, generally, we don't provide sort of detailed traffic trends by month. But given the timing of tax refunds and stimulus payments, you can imagine that sales were stronger later in the quarter than at the beginning. In terms of traffic trends, again, traffic for us is transactions, it mirrors pretty close to our sales trends. The comp sales guide? No, again, I think Michael, we've talked about it, there are a number of factors that drove the Q1 performance, be it stimulus, pent-up demand, vaccine rollouts, et cetera. And it's difficult to precisely predict how long some of those will last. And so we took that into account and projected forward what we think is our current plan and best guess for Q2, and we certainly hope to do better. Yes. In terms of the merchandise margin, again, the buying environment remains very dynamic. Margins will vary significantly based on our overall sales performance. We've talked, over the last several quarters, that the buying environment has been quite strong, and we benefited from that. Obviously, in the first quarter, we also benefited from significant above plan sales, which drove faster turns and fewer markdowns. So those were all positive. \n In terms of how long that sustains, we'll see. I mean we have our best guess built into the guidance, and we obviously hope to do better. And the extent we do, we'd expect to see some further benefit. In terms of new store productivity, we don't break out dd's specifically, but overall, new store productivity continues to be in the 60% to 65% range that we've talked about historically."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler. Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for 2023. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, during a very competitive holiday season, our fourth quarter sales and earnings results exceeded our guidance due to customers' positive response to our improved assortment and stronger value offerings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the  13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021. \n For the 2022 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, with comparable store sales down 4% versus a robust 13%  increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.\n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, shoes was the best-performing merchandise area, while Florida was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved compared to the prior quarter but continue to trail Ross' results primarily due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are continuing to have a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of 2022 with consolidated inventories down 11% versus last year. Average store inventories during the quarter were down slightly compared to 2021 holiday period, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace.\n As noted in today's release, the company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March of 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023. Our Board also recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% and to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023. Our stock repurchase and increased dividend program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2023. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 1% for the quarter on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. This slight increase was due to growth in the size of the average basket as traffic was relatively flat compared to last year. As Barbara discussed earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 10.7% was up 90 basis points from 9.8% in 2021. Cost of goods sold grew 15 basis points versus last year due to a combination of factors. Distribution expenses rose 90 basis points primarily due to timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center earlier in the year, while domestic freight and occupancy delevered by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these costs with higher merchandise margin, which grew by 15 basis points as the benefit from lower ocean freight costs more than offset somewhat higher markdowns. Buying expenses also improved by 85 basis points due to lower incentive compensation. SG&A for the period levered by 105 basis points, again, primarily due to lower incentive expense.\n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023. As Barbara noted in our press release, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business. While we hope to do better for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. It is important to note that fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the extra week.\n Our guidance assumptions for the 2023 year include the following: Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 5% for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are planned to be relatively flat. Based on these sales plans, Operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7%. This reflects the resetting of the baseline for incentive compensation, higher wages, the deleveraging effect on flattish same-store sales and lower freight costs. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 20 basis points from the 53rd week.\n For 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $570 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $339 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2023 are planned to be approximately $810 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.\n Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. Elevated inflation continues to impact our low to moderate income customer. As such, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be up 1% to 4% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 9.6% to 9.9% compared to 10.8% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect of same-store sales perform in line with our plan, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Further, merchandise margin is forecast to benefit from lower freight costs. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $28 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about $341 million.\n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. To sum up, over the past 3 years, we have faced a wide range of unprecedented challenges from the COVID pandemic, supply chain disruptions as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds. These factors have not only negatively impacted our own business, but also our customers' household budgets, their discretionary income and their shopping behaviors. As a result, our shoppers today are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, our merchants are fine-tuning our assortments with an increased focus on delivering the most competitive bargains available while continuing to adjust our product mix based on our customers' evolving preferences. Looking ahead, we have significantly increased our focus on strictly controlling inventory and operating expenses throughout the company. We strongly believe that these measures will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in 2023 and beyond.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I wanted to ask about freight, both of the components within gross margin. How much recovery do you have baked into your guidance for this year versus pre-COVID levels? And then how much opportunity remains for the next year and the year after? \nAdam Orvos: Yes. So Lorraine, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. related to merchandise margin, Q1 and fiscal 2023 will clearly benefit from lower ocean freight costs as we anniversary the significantly higher cost from last year. While these costs will drop, they'll likely still be higher than pre-pandemic levels in the short term. But on the ocean side, they've clearly dropped dramatically and we'll harvest a significant portion of the increase we've faced over the last 3 years. On the domestic side, because of wages -- elevated wages and still higher fuel cost than pre-pandemic, we'll harvest back some of the domestic freight, but not as tangible in 2023 as it will be on the ocean side. \nLorraine Maikis: So you'd say some  opportunity will remain for fiscal '24? \nAdam Orvos: Probably not prudent to go that far ahead, but it clearly will be a tailwind on both sides for us in 2023. And depending on how much they move in 2023. That I'll kind of see what's left for 2024. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter. So Barbara, on fourth quarter same-store sales inflecting back to positive territory, maybe can you just speak to the cadence of traffic that you saw during the quarter? And then on the outlook for flat comps in both 1Q and for the year relative to historically a 1% to 2% starting plan. Have you seen a material change in customer behavior post-holiday? Or is this more just taking a prudent stance given the volatility that you cited? \nMichael Hartshorn: Matthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the guidance for the first quarter, as we said in our commentary, with the lasting inflation and highly uncertain macro economy ahead of us, we firmly believe it's prudent to be conservative in planning the business. Internally, this puts us in a chase mode to start the year, both from an inventory open-to-buy perspective and in managing the underlying cost in the business. It's a playbook that we're familiar with. We know well and believe it will allow us to, as we said in the commentary, maximize both the top line and the bottom line in an uncertain environment, and we'll have to see how it plays out for the year. In terms of traffic data, as we said in the commentary, traffic was relatively flat in the quarter, and that was relatively consistent across the fourth quarter. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on gross margin. So if we exclude the freight recovery, how are you thinking about underlying merchandise margins within this year's guide? Meaning, is there any impact we need to think about with some of the changes in mix that you cited? Maybe how best to think about price. I mean, what I'm really trying to get at is beyond this year, do you think there's any structural underlying change to double-digit earnings growth in this model if we can get back to that 3% to 4% comp algorithm? \nMichael Hartshorn: Let me talk a little bit about the long-term operating model. We certainly, with ocean freights coming down, we'd expect to see a big benefit this year. Longer term, the margin improvements will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth, but also, as we mentioned, to a large extent, the persistence and the inflationary costs in the business. We, again, expect to see ocean freight costs preceding this year, but they still remain above pre-pandemic levels and a number of transportation lanes. So that could be a benefit beyond 2023.\n We also expect to see lower domestic freight rates this year, and that's embedded in our guidance. But we see these pressures easing over a longer horizon and is somewhat dependent on fuel costs. Wage costs have risen, but are growing at a slower pace than they did during the pandemic. We expect from a wage perspective that it will be an ongoing pressure, but we are finding ways to be more efficient in the business that's offsetting some of those costs. So all of those taken together, we believe we can grow our EBIT margins and profitability over time, but it will be very important to drive top line sales growth in that equation. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: In terms of the competitive backdrop, some of the bigger general merchandise retailers look leaner on inventory, especially apparel and discretionary categories heading into the spring. Just curious how that's incorporating into your thinking on comps and potential for some recapture of market share cycling last year? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. I think -- then pulling back on general merchandise potentially gives sense gives us an opportunity to grow those businesses since it's such a big part of our business. But I really think regaining, capturing market share, however we want to say that, it really depends on driving sales, and we think that the best way to drive sales is for us to continue to focus on value for our customer. I mean that's really what helped us perform in the fourth quarter is really making sure that we're delivering the best brand of organ possible throughout the entire store. And that really is our focus. That compounded with the fact that there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, which will enable us to do that. I think that's really what will help us gain back that market share, whether it's coming from a big box or it's coming from other parts of retail departmental stores whatever it is. I think that's really the key for our success go forward to drive top line sales. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Are you seeing any signs of a trade-down customers showing up in your stores? I know you said transactions traffic was flat, but curious if the customer base is changing at all or maybe you're seeing some higher income folks show up, maybe some of the lower income folks shop less. I'm also curious how you're thinking about the drivers of comp in F '23 from a traffic versus ticket perspective. \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, on the trade-down customer, there isn't what we see in our data, a material shift in spending trends across the different income demographics. So at this point for us, we don't see any evidence that the trade down -- that there is the trade down customers impacting our business. On how we're thinking about the business going forward. We don't typically plan the business based on the components of the transaction. As Barbara said, our focus is on value and off-price value will lead to a better traffic, it will lead to a higher basket if you offer great deals to the customer, and that's how we're thinking about the business going forward. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And can you just share what your home versus apparel comps were in 4Q? Also curious about California, Florida, Texas performance. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. The home sales were slightly above the chain average. And then overall, apparel, non-apparel performance was relatively similar. And the thing that part of what's really drove home is that Home has the highest penetration of gifting and that part of our business performed well. \nAdam Orvos: And Paul, on the geography side, Florida, as we mentioned, it was the strongest market. Regarding our other large markets, California performed slightly above the chain average and Texas tracked in line with the change average. With all that said, we did not see a lot of deviation in the numbers by geographic area. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Could you unpack how you're thinking about the merch margin, excluding the freight here for the year, I guess, the product margin. Just trying to think -- just trying to marry up what you guys are seeing on inventory buys and how pricing can lead us to the product margin this year? And then I guess, pretty simple one, Michael, when you guys think about the puts and takes on -- or Michael or Adam, I should say, puts and takes on the margins and the buckets that you pointed to resetting the incentive comp, the higher wages, the flat same-store sales impact and the lower freight cost. Can you speak to how the upside would flow through on 1 point of comp this year? I know you always give us some -- the framework of about 15 basis points, I think, for memory, what's better in the composition of the model this year? What's worse than normal on a 1 point of upside in the comp? \nMichael Hartshorn: Michael, you got it exactly right. 1 point of comp is approximately 10 to 15 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. So that hasn't changed. \nAdam Orvos: And Michael, I'll jump in. So like on operating margin, the moving parts in 2023. So first of all, we're planning the flat comp, which will cause some amount of deleverage. As you mentioned, we have to reset our incentive cost at target levels. So 2022 was clearly an underperforming year for us, and that was on top of a 2021 where we significantly overperformed our plan. So for 2023, we will reset that baseline at target levels. Michael mentioned earlier, we've seen wage increases, both in our stores and our distribution centers. And while that's easing we've not been able to fully mitigate those increases within the stores by driving other efficiencies. And then my earlier comments on freight, we expect good news on both sides but more dramatic improvement on the ocean side. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of buying, Michael, I know you know there's a lot of merchandise out in the marketplace. But the way we're way we're looking at that now is we are really highly focused on value and giving our customers the best value possible. And -- so that very much depends on our mix on the buys, what we're doing and really driving broad-based across the company. I can't emphasize this enough, the best value possible that we can because that really -- our customer is under such inflationary pressures that it definitely is impacting on her spend and so her discretionary spend. And so that's really how we're thinking about that, making sure that our values are correct and that we have a good, better, best strategy and that she really feels great about what she buys and that it's compelling to come to the store. And so those AUR since it would take us down the path of AUR is not a direct opening price point strategy. It really is good, better, best strategy based on brands that we have out there so that she can really get the value that she's come to expect from us. \nMichael Binetti: Barb, could I chase that with a question on how you think about what are the biggest opportunities that you see to go after some market share this year to help -- if there is an opportunity to drive comp above flat, maybe it's from the ability to compete better, anything that stands out to you early in the year? \nBarbara Rentler: I think -- well, I think there's a few things. Just internally, we had our own internal issues, obviously, last year within our assortments. So correcting those issues right now is important to us just from a balance and mix perspective. Based off of the carrier issues and the things that went wrong last year, I think that's probably first and foremost, getting that corrected and then really rightsizing again, our values that we're offering the customer and understanding what our pricing strategy really is and hitting all 3 customers.\n Then outside of that is if we execute better, history would tell us and we chase, which is what we do best, in a time where there's a lot of merchandise in the market, which there is, we should be able to drive sales and take market share. And that market share, as you know, can come from any bucket of merchandising now since everyone is -- whether it's big boxes or everyone is in the game now. So I think that's kind of the formula for us to correct our issues from last year to get our value straight and so that the customer really is getting a great deal maximizing those closeouts in the market. \n And listen, remember, we have a very large merchant team. We have 900 merchants. And so -- and strong relationships in the market. So now is the time for us to maximize on that and to really give the customer what she's come to expect from us and to get ourselves set. And if we do those things, then I think we'll get ourselves on the track we want to be on and continue to grow and gain market share. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: It sounds like sales recovery is key to returning to pre-COVID margin and the earnings algorithm, but are you exploring ways to kind of offset that while top line growth is underperforming that typical algorithm? Maybe put differently, what specific levers do you have in COGS or SG&A to offset some of the freight and wage headwinds you're seeing this year? I know you mentioned some efficiencies, but any examples there -- levers broadly would be helpful to hear. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. You'll see in our capital spend this year, we have about $810 million included in that and one of the biggest increases there are technology investments that we're making. And some examples of that would be automation in our distribution centers. It would be looking at store level activities and providing technology to make those more efficient in all of our stores, for instance, how our associates mark down goods, how they receive in the back room and making sure we can continue to have associates focusing on customer facing and activities. So those are a few of those examples. And we have -- as we have over the years, have a road map of efficiencies that will continue to work on as an organization and drive into the P&L. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nJesse Sobelson: This is Jesse Sobelson on for Ike. I believe at the beginning of last year's first quarter, the buying environment was just beginning to turn into a tailwind for you guys. So how does the environment look today versus this time last year and then versus maybe 6 months ago? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. The buying environment right now is very good. I mean there's a lot of merchandise. It's very broad-based. It's across all different classifications and types of products. So the buying environment is probably as good as it gets right now. I would say that, that environment has been there, though for the last few months and started at the beginning of last year, just timed perhaps differently depending upon what type of product it was and when it came in, all going back to the carrier issue, right? So everyone was kind of -- vendors were kind of late in receiving their goods because people couldn't really control the way the freight came in. So it's been here for a while. I would think at this point in time, a lot of stores have promoting to get their inventories in line in-store, but the vendor community still has a lot of merchandise that they'd like to move through and take them forward to newness to the next year. \n So I think it's I think it's very good now. I think it's been good, and I think it will be good for a while as the vendors are trying to work through that and understand what that looks like and then understand what kind of inventory position they want to take go forward as opposed to having a result and that coming from the carrier issues that everybody kind of felt at the same time. So... \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. First, just a housekeeping. Is it fair to use $200 million to $250 million in sales for that 53rd week? And then Barbara, I think, maybe this for you. What is the issue with sort of the packaway timing. And I know packaway ended up at 40% but that's still below kind of run rate norm. And I'm just thinking if the environment is super conducive, would you not want to kind of have that short stay because I know you guys do it more on a 4-month or less or whatever shorter duration. \n And then last one is for the shrink. I think you do it once a year, but what shrink as a percent of sales in a normal backdrop, where is it today? Sorry to interrupt. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. No problem. So the packaway is 40%, overall deals that we feel very, very good about. And you have to remember that in the beginning of last year, and you'll see this as we go along, we had all those late goods that were home goods that we took into our  DCs,  which would have increased part of our packaway. The 40% that we have in there right now, we feel very good about. And buying packaway is an art, you can buy a lot of packaway time you want, right? But the packaway you put in there, you have to feel it's great product at great values. And right now, with the buying environment being very favorable with really, quite frankly, broad access to some really key brands, you're going to be very judicious about what you put in packaway and how you time that and what that looks like. So I'd say we feel good about the position we're in today. We have a tremendous amount of liquidity and we really feel like we're in a good place. \nMichael Hartshorn: Adrienne, on shrink. So our strength, we don't disclose what it is externally, but it is a place where we constantly invest, whether it's security tags or no equipment in the stores. If you've been in our stores, you see we have people in front of the store and our shrink was slightly higher this year as we closed out the year. \nAdam Orvos: And Adrienne... \nBarbara Rentler: Yes, go ahead. \nAdam Orvos: Well, I was just going to jump in on the 53rd week. So a little bit higher than what you said. You can think about it as an additional week, somewhat pro rata, but then downward calibrated a little bit that it's, call it, in January, February week and lighter than an average week. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Curious if stores in higher demographic markets performed better and store in lower income demographic markets. And a second follow-up, there's a lot of talk about SNAP cuts next month and lower tax refunds this year versus last. Curious how much of a potential headwind that could be for you guys over the next couple of months. \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes, we'll have to see. On the tax refunds, they just started to come out last week, and that does have an impact, especially for our dd's business, but we'll have to see how that plays out. We certainly where we're coming into it, the tax refunds could be lower. So we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly, that is a customer that can be impacted by both the tax refunds and the SNAP benefits. On your other question, I think you asked a question around demographics. And I think I answered this earlier with Paul, we have not seen a material shift in spending across different income demographics. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: Barbara, it sounds like you continue to see opportunities to rightsize the value that you offer the consumer to go after that market share that's available to you and that you're still looking to optimize that value. Can you talk a little bit more about the actions that your buying team can take to ensure that you're offering that value? And can you contextualize that with the higher rate of markdowns that you also saw in the quarter? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Well, obviously, when there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, the buyers are out looking for really great deals. So it starts with being in the market, having good relationships and really getting the deals at the prices that the customer wants and then offering that value to the customer. So I think that's critical for what's going on in the world today. It's always been critical for us delivering branded bargains. And I think today it's even more important than it's been before. \n In terms of just -- rightsizing the value just as a concept of rightsizing the value. I think that's really from putting things out there and watching things turn, watching things -- watching the customer vote and then making the adjustments based off of what she's telling us, whether it's in the assortment and the products that she want or whether it's in the retail that we put it in. And Brooke, what was the second question? \nBrooke Roach: The second question was just how to think about the time line of getting that from a markdown perspective. It sounds like making those adjustments does require some markdown. And so does the markdown have to increase year-on-year as you move through 2023? \nBarbara Rentler: We took -- okay, I understood. So we took somewhat slightly higher markdowns in the fourth quarter. And we made sure that when we came out of the fourth quarter that we really came out of everything clean that we took everything. And if the value wasn't right, we didn't wait, we took markdowns, they were somewhat higher, they weren't that much higher, they were somewhat higher. And so if you're rightsizing your values going forward, you wouldn't expect to be taking additional markdowns. The key is to drive receipts, which drives sales. So if we have the right values and return quick enough, we'll drive receipts, which will drive sales, which will put us in a healthy position. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the real estate portfolio in the stores, we obviously have heard about some of the space availabilities from the Bed Bath or a Party City. Is this an opportunity for you? And does it all change the cadence of store openings or the locations or regions for either 2023 or 2024 in your outlook? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, certainly, Bed Bath, Beyond and Party City, like they have been historically, any time there's retail bankruptcies that's provided us opportunities for new store locations. I would say at this point, it hasn't changed our outlook. We will review potential new site on a store-by-store basis. And if it's appropriate for Ross  and  dd's location, we can certainly add it to our portfolio. But as we think about 2023, as we said in the commentary, we think it's about 100 new locations, about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. \nDana Telsey: Got it. And then, Barbara, just on the category mix, what was the weakest? And what do you see as opportunities on the category side as we go through 2023? \nBarbara Rentler: The business  pretty much performed at the same level. I mean, obviously, some things are better. I mean home and gifting was very good, shoes was very good. If I look at shoes from a 2-year basis, the year before we had carrier issues, which also helped us to drive some sales this year. I think the key is to get the category mix balance to what the customer wants. And I think last year with the carrier issues and with some of the things that went on in our assortments, that we didn't have that. So I think now it's really identifying what she wants, making those move to ensure that we are delivering the products that she's moving towards as things continue to evolve in her assortment and just being on target with that, making sure we're making moves quick enough, fast enough and the advantage when there's a lot of goods in the marketplace, it allows you to do more of these things and oftentimes, sometimes be able to make some bolder moves.\n So I think that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about just getting our inventories and classifications in line and then more fine-tuning to what -- if we were talking about this a few months ago, we would be saying people now want career pants versus casual, right? But I'm thinking more broader that with all the carriers that went on and  delivery issues and everything else, that things were not exactly the way we would like them to have been even if we wanted them to be there. It just -- it wasn't balanced. \n So I think that's our number 1 thing is getting ourselves back in line. We made a lot of those moves into the fourth quarter and getting ourselves repositioned to where we want to be. And then going again hand-in-hand with making sure we come in clean -- into the year clean from an inventory position and then giving ourselves the flexibility to go in the market and buy it the way the customer wants it and sees it. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Could you discuss what like-for-like AUR look like versus mix shift driven AUR maybe? And then a dumb question. I think interest income came in nicely higher this quarter. And if I heard correctly, I think you're expecting a pretty nice jump or a nice number this year as well. Is that just a function of higher rates? And does it impact your capital return strategy? And maybe just given how large the cash balance is, any broader thoughts on your use of cash with all the moving pieces? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. The interest income is entirely driven by our cash balances. That's invested in government-backed securities. So as interest rates have risen, we're getting a benefit there. In terms of how we're thinking about use of cash, and I guess just general capital allocation, we will, as we always do, first invest in the business to support profitable growth. We also plan to pay down COVID-related debt that begins to mature over the next few years in '24 and '25 as when those first tranches mature. And then we'd expect to grow our shareholder payouts as the business grows, as I said, deliberately over time, and we do that in a very deliberate and reliable manner over time. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of our AUR, our AUR has been relatively flat despite all the different shifts and moving parts in the business. So some of that comes from valuing some areas differently or products differently in other businesses coming up because obviously, shoes has a higher AUR than some of our other businesses. So that's really where we stand today, how we're thinking about it. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: Great. I'm wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on some of the higher wages that you mentioned as a driver of the EBIT margin in the first quarter this year. Can you just talk about the impact on what you're seeing at the store level versus like, say, a warehousing level versus at a corporate level, that would be helpful. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. I mean it's been a competitive market across all 3 of those for some time. What we saw during COVID is the biggest pressure we had was in the distribution center, line item and that we've seen the pressure there slow down considerably. And for the stores, we continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing them and increasing wages where appropriate. In addition, as you know, there's growing statutory minimum wages for us in almost half of our store base, and that includes both statewide and local municipality minimum wages. But overall, it's really driven at this point by those minimum wages -- wage increases. I would say we feel good about the workforce in totality and are confident about what we have in place for the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: Crossing my fingers, you'll answer this one, but are you currently trending in line with your first quarter guide? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't. Our practice is, Laura, to not comment on inter-quarter trends. \nLaura Champine: Understood. Is the guidance for the full year comp to be flat would that assume that traffic is roughly flat this year? \nMichael Hartshorn: We -- again, we don't plan the business around traffic or transaction. Our view has always been if we provide the great branded bargains to the customer, that will be a combination of, one, bringing more customers to the store and two, when they're in the store, increasing the size of the average basket. What's happened over the last several years is that basket has grown and even into last year, on top of the stimulus year the customer is buying more when they're coming to the store. \nLaura Champine: Let me see if I can get this one. The gross margin, and this is last -- the gross margin commentary that you've made, is that consistent with taking more markdowns this year for the year as a whole compared to last year? \nAdam Orvos: Laura, we don't guide really at that component level of merchandise margin, but obviously, our markdown levels will be highly dependent on if we deliver our sales plan and by the right goods. The biggest moving part as we said, in merchandise margin will be the ocean freight cost reductions that we're seeing in the marketplace. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: So the comp guidance for the full year implies a 4-year stack of 10 a CAGR of just over  2%,  which is quite a bit lower than your historical pre-COVID performance. Are you still -- do you still believe in the medium term, algo being kind of a little bit higher than that around the 3% comp algo? Or is there something structural about the comps that you think will decelerate even beyond this year? \n And then, Michael, you talked about the sensitivity of margins to comp, but with higher wages now embedded into your cost structure, has that sensitivity changed? Or is it still a similar sensitivity as what you've talked about in the past? \nMichael Hartshorn: Aneesha, on the guidance, it's hard to comment on structural in this environment. As we guide the year, it's really a function of us wanting to be very conservative in a blasting inflationary environment and a macro economy that we'll see how that plays out later in the year. So I don't think there's anything to read into that at this point. Obviously, we hope to beat the guidance. We think it's a good way to run our business in an uncertain environment. In terms of the long-term algorithm, it certainly doesn't change as I said earlier, that a beat to comp is 10 to 15 basis points upside. And then longer term, we think if we can grow the 3% to 4% comp as we did historically prior to COVID that we'll be able to leverage the P&L. \nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: You mentioned that shoes had done pretty well a few times. Is there any way to parse out maybe whether it was in formal or casual, what did better? And then I know availability is quite robust, but across your good, better, best strategy, is there any particular segment within those 3 that's maybe you're seeing a little bit better availability. And then just lastly, on CapEx. Historically, you're usually around, I think, like $500 million or so in CapEx. And now I think in this year, you're expecting to do $800 million and in this coming year as well, another $800 million. So could you just parse out maybe what the incremental spend is really going to be? I know you talked a little bit about automation, but just curious what else there is in there. \nBarbara Rentler: So let me start with shoes. So the shoe business is pretty broad based. I would say that athletic performed slightly better than brand shoes, but the shoe business, again, the shoes industry had issues delivering, we remember that in 2021 with the whole carrier issue. So it is pretty broad-based and meeting customers' demands that they want not just athletic, but other brands shoes to wear. That's the first thing. In terms of a good, better, best, the availability is pretty broad-based in all 3 buckets. So I think that's a little unusual, but that is what -- that's kind of going on out there right at this moment. \nAdam Orvos: And Corey, on CapEx. So our $810 million will roughly be 40% new in existing stores, 40% distribution centers and about 20% technology and other investments. And I would say with our new store opening plan of 100 new stores, that's -- those levels are consistent with pre-pandemic levels from a mix standpoint, the distribution line, probably a little bit inflated as we ramp up capacity to support our long-term growth and then the technology side is a ramp-up as we're making investments not only from a customer convenience standpoint in the stores, but also building capabilities and additional tools in the merchandising organization. \nOperator: And at this time, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thanks joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: That concludes our conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "content": "Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for 2023. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, during a very competitive holiday season, our fourth quarter sales and earnings results exceeded our guidance due to customers' positive response to our improved assortment and stronger value offerings. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.31 on net income of $447 million. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.04 on net earnings of $367 million for the  13 weeks ended January 29, 2022. Sales for the fourth quarter of 2022 were $5.2 billion with comparable store sales up 1% on top of a 9% increase for the same period in 2021. \n For the 2022 fiscal year, earnings per share were $4.38 on net income of $1.5 billion compared to $4.87 per share on net earnings of $1.7 billion in 2021. Sales for 2022 were $18.7 billion, with comparable store sales down 4% versus a robust 13%  increase in the prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was 10.7% compared to 9.8% in 2021. This improvement was mainly driven by lower freight and incentive costs that were partially offset by unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses.\n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, shoes was the best-performing merchandise area, while Florida was the strongest region. Similar to Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends improved compared to the prior quarter but continue to trail Ross' results primarily due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are continuing to have a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of 2022 with consolidated inventories down 11% versus last year. Average store inventories during the quarter were down slightly compared to 2021 holiday period, while packaway merchandise represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. We also believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the numerous buying opportunities in the marketplace.\n As noted in today's release, the company repurchased a total of 2.1 million and 10.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $231 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March of 2022. We expect to complete the $950 million remaining under this authorization in fiscal 2023. Our Board also recently increased our quarterly cash dividend by 8% and to $0.335 per share to be payable on March 31, 2023, to stockholders of record as of March 14, 2023. Our stock repurchase and increased dividend program reflects our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns as well as our confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and projected future cash flows.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2023. Thank you, Adam. To sum up, over the past 3 years, we have faced a wide range of unprecedented challenges from the COVID pandemic, supply chain disruptions as well as ongoing inflationary headwinds. These factors have not only negatively impacted our own business, but also our customers' household budgets, their discretionary income and their shopping behaviors. As a result, our shoppers today are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, our merchants are fine-tuning our assortments with an increased focus on delivering the most competitive bargains available while continuing to adjust our product mix based on our customers' evolving preferences. Looking ahead, we have significantly increased our focus on strictly controlling inventory and operating expenses throughout the company. We strongly believe that these measures will enable us to maximize our potential for both sales and profit growth in 2023 and beyond.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. Sure. I think -- then pulling back on general merchandise potentially gives sense gives us an opportunity to grow those businesses since it's such a big part of our business. But I really think regaining, capturing market share, however we want to say that, it really depends on driving sales, and we think that the best way to drive sales is for us to continue to focus on value for our customer. I mean that's really what helped us perform in the fourth quarter is really making sure that we're delivering the best brand of organ possible throughout the entire store. And that really is our focus. That compounded with the fact that there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, which will enable us to do that. I think that's really what will help us gain back that market share, whether it's coming from a big box or it's coming from other parts of retail departmental stores whatever it is. I think that's really the key for our success go forward to drive top line sales. Sure. The home sales were slightly above the chain average. And then overall, apparel, non-apparel performance was relatively similar. And the thing that part of what's really drove home is that Home has the highest penetration of gifting and that part of our business performed well. And then in terms of buying, Michael, I know you know there's a lot of merchandise out in the marketplace. But the way we're way we're looking at that now is we are really highly focused on value and giving our customers the best value possible. And -- so that very much depends on our mix on the buys, what we're doing and really driving broad-based across the company. I can't emphasize this enough, the best value possible that we can because that really -- our customer is under such inflationary pressures that it definitely is impacting on her spend and so her discretionary spend. And so that's really how we're thinking about that, making sure that our values are correct and that we have a good, better, best strategy and that she really feels great about what she buys and that it's compelling to come to the store. And so those AUR since it would take us down the path of AUR is not a direct opening price point strategy. It really is good, better, best strategy based on brands that we have out there so that she can really get the value that she's come to expect from us. I think -- well, I think there's a few things. Just internally, we had our own internal issues, obviously, last year within our assortments. So correcting those issues right now is important to us just from a balance and mix perspective. Based off of the carrier issues and the things that went wrong last year, I think that's probably first and foremost, getting that corrected and then really rightsizing again, our values that we're offering the customer and understanding what our pricing strategy really is and hitting all 3 customers.\n Then outside of that is if we execute better, history would tell us and we chase, which is what we do best, in a time where there's a lot of merchandise in the market, which there is, we should be able to drive sales and take market share. And that market share, as you know, can come from any bucket of merchandising now since everyone is -- whether it's big boxes or everyone is in the game now. So I think that's kind of the formula for us to correct our issues from last year to get our value straight and so that the customer really is getting a great deal maximizing those closeouts in the market. \n And listen, remember, we have a very large merchant team. We have 900 merchants. And so -- and strong relationships in the market. So now is the time for us to maximize on that and to really give the customer what she's come to expect from us and to get ourselves set. And if we do those things, then I think we'll get ourselves on the track we want to be on and continue to grow and gain market share. Sure. The buying environment right now is very good. I mean there's a lot of merchandise. It's very broad-based. It's across all different classifications and types of products. So the buying environment is probably as good as it gets right now. I would say that, that environment has been there, though for the last few months and started at the beginning of last year, just timed perhaps differently depending upon what type of product it was and when it came in, all going back to the carrier issue, right? So everyone was kind of -- vendors were kind of late in receiving their goods because people couldn't really control the way the freight came in. So it's been here for a while. I would think at this point in time, a lot of stores have promoting to get their inventories in line in-store, but the vendor community still has a lot of merchandise that they'd like to move through and take them forward to newness to the next year. \n So I think it's I think it's very good now. I think it's been good, and I think it will be good for a while as the vendors are trying to work through that and understand what that looks like and then understand what kind of inventory position they want to take go forward as opposed to having a result and that coming from the carrier issues that everybody kind of felt at the same time. So... Okay. No problem. So the packaway is 40%, overall deals that we feel very, very good about. And you have to remember that in the beginning of last year, and you'll see this as we go along, we had all those late goods that were home goods that we took into our  DCs,  which would have increased part of our packaway. The 40% that we have in there right now, we feel very good about. And buying packaway is an art, you can buy a lot of packaway time you want, right? But the packaway you put in there, you have to feel it's great product at great values. And right now, with the buying environment being very favorable with really, quite frankly, broad access to some really key brands, you're going to be very judicious about what you put in packaway and how you time that and what that looks like. So I'd say we feel good about the position we're in today. We have a tremendous amount of liquidity and we really feel like we're in a good place. Yes, go ahead. Sure. Well, obviously, when there's a lot of merchandise in the marketplace, the buyers are out looking for really great deals. So it starts with being in the market, having good relationships and really getting the deals at the prices that the customer wants and then offering that value to the customer. So I think that's critical for what's going on in the world today. It's always been critical for us delivering branded bargains. And I think today it's even more important than it's been before. \n In terms of just -- rightsizing the value just as a concept of rightsizing the value. I think that's really from putting things out there and watching things turn, watching things -- watching the customer vote and then making the adjustments based off of what she's telling us, whether it's in the assortment and the products that she want or whether it's in the retail that we put it in. And Brooke, what was the second question? We took -- okay, I understood. So we took somewhat slightly higher markdowns in the fourth quarter. And we made sure that when we came out of the fourth quarter that we really came out of everything clean that we took everything. And if the value wasn't right, we didn't wait, we took markdowns, they were somewhat higher, they weren't that much higher, they were somewhat higher. And so if you're rightsizing your values going forward, you wouldn't expect to be taking additional markdowns. The key is to drive receipts, which drives sales. So if we have the right values and return quick enough, we'll drive receipts, which will drive sales, which will put us in a healthy position. The business  pretty much performed at the same level. I mean, obviously, some things are better. I mean home and gifting was very good, shoes was very good. If I look at shoes from a 2-year basis, the year before we had carrier issues, which also helped us to drive some sales this year. I think the key is to get the category mix balance to what the customer wants. And I think last year with the carrier issues and with some of the things that went on in our assortments, that we didn't have that. So I think now it's really identifying what she wants, making those move to ensure that we are delivering the products that she's moving towards as things continue to evolve in her assortment and just being on target with that, making sure we're making moves quick enough, fast enough and the advantage when there's a lot of goods in the marketplace, it allows you to do more of these things and oftentimes, sometimes be able to make some bolder moves.\n So I think that's kind of how I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about just getting our inventories and classifications in line and then more fine-tuning to what -- if we were talking about this a few months ago, we would be saying people now want career pants versus casual, right? But I'm thinking more broader that with all the carriers that went on and  delivery issues and everything else, that things were not exactly the way we would like them to have been even if we wanted them to be there.

And then going again hand-in-hand with making sure we come in clean -- into the year clean from an inventory position and then giving ourselves the flexibility to go in the market and buy it the way the customer wants it and sees it.

In terms of a good, better, best, the availability is pretty broad-based in all 3 buckets.

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose 1% for the quarter on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. This slight increase was due to growth in the size of the average basket as traffic was relatively flat compared to last year. As Barbara discussed earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 10.7% was up 90 basis points from 9.8% in 2021. Cost of goods sold grew 15 basis points versus last year due to a combination of factors. Distribution expenses rose 90 basis points primarily due to timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center earlier in the year, while domestic freight and occupancy delevered by 20 and 5 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these costs with higher merchandise margin, which grew by 15 basis points as the benefit from lower ocean freight costs more than offset somewhat higher markdowns. Buying expenses also improved by 85 basis points due to lower incentive compensation. SG&A for the period levered by 105 basis points, again, primarily due to lower incentive expense.\n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2023. As Barbara noted in our press release, the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments remain highly uncertain. As a result, we believe it is prudent to remain conservative when planning our business. While we hope to do better for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we are planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2023 to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.95 compared to $4.38 in fiscal 2022. It is important to note that fiscal 2023 is a 53-week year. Incorporated in this guidance range is an estimated benefit to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the extra week.\n Our guidance assumptions for the 2023 year include the following: Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 5% for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are planned to be relatively flat. Based on these sales plans, Operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 10.3% to 10.7%. This reflects the resetting of the baseline for incentive compensation, higher wages, the deleveraging effect on flattish same-store sales and lower freight costs. Also incorporated in this operating margin guidance is an estimated benefit of about 20 basis points from the 53rd week.\n For 2023, we expect to open approximately 100 new locations comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 older stores. Net interest income is estimated to be $115 million. Depreciation and amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $570 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $339 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2023 are planned to be approximately $810 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business.\n Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. Elevated inflation continues to impact our low to moderate income customer. As such, we are also planning comparable store sales to be relatively flat for the 13 weeks ending April 29, 2023. This compares to a 7% decrease and a 13% gain in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, respectively. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2023 to be $0.99 to $1.05 versus $0.97 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are planned to be up 1% to 4% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 9.6% to 9.9% compared to 10.8% last year. The expected decline reflects the deleveraging effect of same-store sales perform in line with our plan, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher wages. Further, merchandise margin is forecast to benefit from lower freight costs. We plan to add 19 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $28 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecast to be about $341 million.\n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. Yes. So Lorraine, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. related to merchandise margin, Q1 and fiscal 2023 will clearly benefit from lower ocean freight costs as we anniversary the significantly higher cost from last year. While these costs will drop, they'll likely still be higher than pre-pandemic levels in the short term. But on the ocean side, they've clearly dropped dramatically and we'll harvest a significant portion of the increase we've faced over the last 3 years. On the domestic side, because of wages -- elevated wages and still higher fuel cost than pre-pandemic, we'll harvest back some of the domestic freight, but not as tangible in 2023 as it will be on the ocean side. Probably not prudent to go that far ahead, but it clearly will be a tailwind on both sides for us in 2023. And depending on how much they move in 2023. That I'll kind of see what's left for 2024. And Paul, on the geography side, Florida, as we mentioned, it was the strongest market. Regarding our other large markets, California performed slightly above the chain average and Texas tracked in line with the change average. With all that said, we did not see a lot of deviation in the numbers by geographic area. And Michael, I'll jump in. So like on operating margin, the moving parts in 2023. So first of all, we're planning the flat comp, which will cause some amount of deleverage. As you mentioned, we have to reset our incentive cost at target levels. So 2022 was clearly an underperforming year for us, and that was on top of a 2021 where we significantly overperformed our plan. So for 2023, we will reset that baseline at target levels. Michael mentioned earlier, we've seen wage increases, both in our stores and our distribution centers. And while that's easing we've not been able to fully mitigate those increases within the stores by driving other efficiencies. And then my earlier comments on freight, we expect good news on both sides but more dramatic improvement on the ocean side. And Adrienne... Well, I was just going to jump in on the 53rd week. So a little bit higher than what you said. You can think about it as an additional week, somewhat pro rata, but then downward calibrated a little bit that it's, call it, in January, February week and lighter than an average week. Laura, we don't guide really at that component level of merchandise margin, but obviously, our markdown levels will be highly dependent on if we deliver our sales plan and by the right goods. The biggest moving part as we said, in merchandise margin will be the ocean freight cost reductions that we're seeing in the marketplace. And Corey, on CapEx. So our $810 million will roughly be 40% new in existing stores, 40% distribution centers and about 20% technology and other investments. And I would say with our new store opening plan of 100 new stores, that's -- those levels are consistent with pre-pandemic levels from a mix standpoint, the distribution line, probably a little bit inflated as we ramp up capacity to support our long-term growth and then the technology side is a ramp-up as we're making investments not only from a customer convenience standpoint in the stores, but also building capabilities and additional tools in the merchandising organization."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Matthew, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the guidance for the first quarter, as we said in our commentary, with the lasting inflation and highly uncertain macro economy ahead of us, we firmly believe it's prudent to be conservative in planning the business. Internally, this puts us in a chase mode to start the year, both from an inventory open-to-buy perspective and in managing the underlying cost in the business. It's a playbook that we're familiar with. We know well and believe it will allow us to, as we said in the commentary, maximize both the top line and the bottom line in an uncertain environment, and we'll have to see how it plays out for the year. In terms of traffic data, as we said in the commentary, traffic was relatively flat in the quarter, and that was relatively consistent across the fourth quarter. Let me talk a little bit about the long-term operating model. We certainly, with ocean freights coming down, we'd expect to see a big benefit this year. Longer term, the margin improvements will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth, but also, as we mentioned, to a large extent, the persistence and the inflationary costs in the business. We, again, expect to see ocean freight costs preceding this year, but they still remain above pre-pandemic levels and a number of transportation lanes. So that could be a benefit beyond 2023.\n We also expect to see lower domestic freight rates this year, and that's embedded in our guidance. But we see these pressures easing over a longer horizon and is somewhat dependent on fuel costs. Wage costs have risen, but are growing at a slower pace than they did during the pandemic. We expect from a wage perspective that it will be an ongoing pressure, but we are finding ways to be more efficient in the business that's offsetting some of those costs. So all of those taken together, we believe we can grow our EBIT margins and profitability over time, but it will be very important to drive top line sales growth in that equation. Paul, on the trade-down customer, there isn't what we see in our data, a material shift in spending trends across the different income demographics. So at this point for us, we don't see any evidence that the trade down -- that there is the trade down customers impacting our business. On how we're thinking about the business going forward. We don't typically plan the business based on the components of the transaction. As Barbara said, our focus is on value and off-price value will lead to a better traffic, it will lead to a higher basket if you offer great deals to the customer, and that's how we're thinking about the business going forward. Michael, you got it exactly right. 1 point of comp is approximately 10 to 15 basis points of EBIT margin expansion. So that hasn't changed. Sure. You'll see in our capital spend this year, we have about $810 million included in that and one of the biggest increases there are technology investments that we're making. And some examples of that would be automation in our distribution centers. It would be looking at store level activities and providing technology to make those more efficient in all of our stores, for instance, how our associates mark down goods, how they receive in the back room and making sure we can continue to have associates focusing on customer facing and activities. So those are a few of those examples. And we have -- as we have over the years, have a road map of efficiencies that will continue to work on as an organization and drive into the P&L. Adrienne, on shrink. So our strength, we don't disclose what it is externally, but it is a place where we constantly invest, whether it's security tags or no equipment in the stores. If you've been in our stores, you see we have people in front of the store and our shrink was slightly higher this year as we closed out the year. Yes, we'll have to see. On the tax refunds, they just started to come out last week, and that does have an impact, especially for our dd's business, but we'll have to see how that plays out. We certainly where we're coming into it, the tax refunds could be lower. So we'll have to see how it plays out. But certainly, that is a customer that can be impacted by both the tax refunds and the SNAP benefits. On your other question, I think you asked a question around demographics. And I think I answered this earlier with Paul, we have not seen a material shift in spending across different income demographics. Dana, certainly, Bed Bath, Beyond and Party City, like they have been historically, any time there's retail bankruptcies that's provided us opportunities for new store locations. I would say at this point, it hasn't changed our outlook. We will review potential new site on a store-by-store basis. And if it's appropriate for Ross  and  dd's location, we can certainly add it to our portfolio. But as we think about 2023, as we said in the commentary, we think it's about 100 new locations, about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. Sure. The interest income is entirely driven by our cash balances. That's invested in government-backed securities. So as interest rates have risen, we're getting a benefit there. In terms of how we're thinking about use of cash, and I guess just general capital allocation, we will, as we always do, first invest in the business to support profitable growth. We also plan to pay down COVID-related debt that begins to mature over the next few years in '24 and '25 as when those first tranches mature. And then we'd expect to grow our shareholder payouts as the business grows, as I said, deliberately over time, and we do that in a very deliberate and reliable manner over time. Sure. I mean it's been a competitive market across all 3 of those for some time. What we saw during COVID is the biggest pressure we had was in the distribution center, line item and that we've seen the pressure there slow down considerably. And for the stores, we continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing them and increasing wages where appropriate. In addition, as you know, there's growing statutory minimum wages for us in almost half of our store base, and that includes both statewide and local municipality minimum wages. But overall, it's really driven at this point by those minimum wages -- wage increases. I would say we feel good about the workforce in totality and are confident about what we have in place for the year. We wouldn't. Our practice is, Laura, to not comment on inter-quarter trends. We -- again, we don't plan the business around traffic or transaction. Our view has always been if we provide the great branded bargains to the customer, that will be a combination of, one, bringing more customers to the store and two, when they're in the store, increasing the size of the average basket. What's happened over the last several years is that basket has grown and even into last year, on top of the stimulus year the customer is buying more when they're coming to the store. Aneesha, on the guidance, it's hard to comment on structural in this environment. As we guide the year, it's really a function of us wanting to be very conservative in a blasting inflationary environment and a macro economy that we'll see how that plays out later in the year. So I don't think there's anything to read into that at this point. Obviously, we hope to beat the guidance. We think it's a good way to run our business in an uncertain environment. In terms of the long-term algorithm, it certainly doesn't change as I said earlier, that a beat to comp is 10 to 15 basis points upside. And then longer term, we think if we can grow the 3% to 4% comp as we did historically prior to COVID that we'll be able to leverage the P&L."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business.\n These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, ma'am. Please go ahead. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger values throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 9.8% versus 11.4% last year, reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, were $1 on net income of $342 million. This compares to $1.09 per share or net earnings of $385 million for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021. Total sales for the quarter were $4.6 billion, in line with the prior year, with comparable sales down 3% on top of a robust 14% gain in the third quarter of 2021.\n For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.08 on net earnings of $1.1 billion compared to $3.82 per share on net income of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2021. Sales for the year-to-date period totaled $13.5 billion with comparable store sales down 5% versus a strong 14% increase last year.\n For the third quarter at Ross, shoes was the best-performing business, while Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions as they were bolstered by the outperformance of border and tourist locations.\n At dd's DISCOUNTS, sales trends improved versus the first half, but continued to trail Ross' results due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of the year, with total consolidated inventories at the end of the quarter up 12% compared to last year.\n Average store inventories during the quarter were up 4% versus 2021 and down compared to pre-pandemic levels. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of the total compared to 31% last year when we used packaway merchandise to fuel robust sales gains.\n Turning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2022 with the addition of 28 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter. For the year, we added a total of 99 locations comprised of 71 Ross and 28 dd's DISCOUNTS. We now expect to end the year with 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 92 stores.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were down 3% in the quarter. Although traffic improved from the second quarter, it still declined versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these declines was a higher average basket size.\n Operating margin of 9.8% for the third quarter was down 160 basis points from last year. Cost of goods sold grew by 230 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin declined 165 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns.\n Distribution costs were up 140 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy delevered by 20 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by a 75 basis point decrease in buying costs, mainly from lower incentives.\n Lastly, pressure from domestic freight expenses eased in the third quarter and improved 20 basis points as we anniversaried the freight headwinds that began in the second half of last year.\n SG&A for the period improved by 70 basis points as deleverage from the negative comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentives. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $244 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low- to moderate-income customers. That said, we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance, given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.\n For the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2023, we now expect comparable store sales to be flat to down 2% on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. As a result, earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.26. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to be flat to up 3%. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 9.7% to 10.5% versus 9.8% last year.\n This mainly reflects the anniversarying of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives, partially offset by the deleveraging effect from lower same-store sales, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher markdowns.\n Net interest income is estimated to be about $14 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 342 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now projected to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.34 compared to $4.87 last year.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. Despite the many challenges over the last few years, coupled with today's uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2,000 locations.\n With consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience, this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on a nice quarter. It's great to see the return to beat and raise. So Barbara, maybe relative to your internal expectations, what did you see from traffic? Or maybe could you speak to the cadence of comp trends as the third quarter progressed? And then could you just elaborate on the improved holiday assortments that you cited in the release? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the traffic trends, as we mentioned -- this is Michael Hartshorn, Matt. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, with the comp down 3%, as we mentioned, traffic did improve for the quarter, but it still declined versus the prior year. So offsetting the traffic decline was a higher average basket.\n The basket was driven by higher AURs, while UPTs were flattish. The increase in the average basket was more than offset by the decline in the number of transactions. As we move through the quarter, what we saw on a stacked basis, so compared to 2019, our trends improved as we progressed through the quarter. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then just a follow-up. Maybe relative to the third quarter, could you just elaborate on maybe the macro or the competitive landscape assumptions that you embedded in your fourth quarter comp guide? It does embed a moderation? Is that prudence? Is it something that you've seen? Or are you embedding more competitive backdrop and maybe a deterioration in the macro in the fourth quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: I would say the -- from our point of view, the macroeconomic environment obviously remains uncertain, but we do think that the holiday period is going to be very promotional. So that's what we've embedded into the guidance. And then just as a reminder, last year, sales at the end of the quarter did trail off. It's our easiest quarterly compare. Trailed off for 2 main reasons. One was the spike in Omicron cases. And then at this point last year, the supply chain continued to be a real challenge for us and other retailers. \nMatthew Boss: Great color. Congrats again. Sorry. Go ahead, Barbara. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. The holiday assortment, so look, we believe our holiday assortment this year, we really have an improved offering of both branded bargains based off of availability in the marketplace and also particularly our gift giving, because of the imbalances we had from the supply chain congestion, as Michael just alluded to. So we feel between the 2 of those, we'd be able to offer great brands, strong values and a broader assortment. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: Great. Just as it relates to the updated guidance, perhaps could you kind of talk about what the key swing factors are there that could drive you either to the higher or the lower end of that new range? \nAdam Orvos: Yes, sure. Alex, this is Adam. So given our guidance of flat to minus 2% comps, we'll have some deleverage impact from sales. Markdowns will be higher than last year in fourth quarter, but not as impactful as in third quarter. Domestic freight, we see as slightly neutral, seeing some benefit in rate, but offset by still elevated fuel prices. Ocean freight will probably be the most tangible tailwind for us.\n As you remember, last year, we were getting into the period where rates were escalating significantly, demand was high. So that will be a tailwind for us. And then given our outperformance last year and our underperformance this year, incentive costs will be lower in Q4 versus last year. And then finally, depending how the end of the year plays out, we'll likely see some pressure from packaway timing in fourth quarter also. \nAlexandra Straton: Great. That's super helpful. Maybe could I just follow up on your inventory levels? I think you said they were up low double digits year-over-year exiting the quarter, which seems like a pretty lean level. So maybe could you tell us, do you feel like you have enough heading into the fourth quarter? Or how are you feeling about the levels and then just the broader assortment? \nMichael Hartshorn: Overall, we feel really good about where we are at the end of the third quarter. As we said in the prepared remarks, we ended up about 12%, which was a big improvement when we -- from the second quarter when we were up 55%. And the increase over the last year is really packaway inventory. So we were at 41% versus 31% last year. And last year was relatively low versus our historical levels because we used a substantial amount of our packaway to chase sales that were well above our plan. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Robert W. Baird. \nMark Altschwager: What do you view as the key drivers to the improving comp trends you saw this quarter? Are you seeing evidence that the trade-down is now occurring? Do you think this is a reflection of the AUR strategy you outlined last quarter? Just if you could expand on your overall assessments there, that would be great. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. From the second quarter to the third quarter, from an assortment perspective, we went in and reset our values and got them to where we believe they need to be in this very promotional environment. So we rightsized our values through some markdowns in some places. And in some places, we rightsized some of our inventory as we were watching shifts go on in the business.\n And the other big shift is apparel and home for us in the quarter performed relatively the same, but our shoe business, which was our best performing business, was really, really fueled by strong values on branded products and availability in the market. \nMichael Hartshorn: And in terms of the trade-down customer, with so many moving parts in the economy, it's difficult to parse out the individual drivers of the improvement. We have not seen a material shift with spending trends across different income demographics, but delivering better bargains to our consumer likely played the most significant role as it typically does. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I was just hoping you could square a couple of comments for us. You talked about resetting values and really focusing on the sharp price points, and your AUR was up. So can you talk about the drivers of AUR in the quarter and then your views on the pricing strategy on a go-forward basis? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So Lorraine, value and price are 2 different things. So the merchants are out constantly assessing what's going on from pricing and competitive shopping and seeing what that is. So in some places, where we felt that our AUR was just too high, we went in and took markdowns. But in other places, based off of assortments and opportunities that we've gotten in the marketplace, the AUR might be higher, but the value is different.\n And then the last component would be some of the shift in the mix of some of the businesses themselves. So for example, our shoe business has been strong. And shoes, obviously, runs a much higher AUR. So there's a variety of things.\n But what I would say in total is that, with back to being such a highly promotional environment that we're in, the merchants will be in the market, really assessing where the values are moving and what that looks like and trying to stay ahead of that. So with -- again, back to the AUR question, that could depend on mix, and that can depend on brand. So there's a variety of issues involved there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: You called out Florida and Texas as being strong regions, but you didn't call out California, which is a little bit surprising, given the checks that were sent out in the month of October. So I just wonder if you could just give us a little bit more color on geographic performance in the quarter. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. This is Adam, Chuck. Yes, Florida and Texas clearly outperformed for us. We're seeing the benefit in border locations. We're seeing the benefit in tourism locations. And those were clearly the outperformers. On the flip side, California underperformed in the quarter. \nMichael Hartshorn: And on California, the checks didn't come out till the end of the quarter, so it didn't have a material impact on Q3. In California, fuel prices have remained significantly more elevated than the rest of the country. That is, we believe, squeezing the lower- to moderate-income customer. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious on what's going on from a shrink perspective. We've had a couple of companies call out, I think, a drag from shrink. I think you guys usually do a physical count in 3Q. So curious what you're seeing on that front.\n And then also just on inventory. Typically, third quarter inventory is a few hundred million bucks above 2Q. Now that's a few hundred million below. So I'm just kind of curious about what your thinking is in terms of quantity and quality and how you're thinking about inventory levels relative to sales going forward. \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, on physical inventory, we did take a physical inventory during the third quarter, and it was slightly higher than last year. And then on inventory levels in Q2, we were -- we believe we had too much inventory, which is why it's down versus the second quarter. \nPaul Lejuez: And then go forward, Michael? \nMichael Hartshorn: I wouldn't comment on the -- on year-end, but it's going to be dependent on packaway opportunities in the marketplace. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: Barbara, I was wondering if you could contemplate and reflect on -- based on the availability of branded goods in the market today, can you talk to the outlook that you see for merch margins for the next few quarters? How are you thinking about taking that mark on and passing that along through the P&L versus passing that value on to the consumer and competing for additional comp opportunity over the next few quarters? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. As you know, there's a lot of availability in the market, and it's really broad-based. And all categories, all brands, it's really broad. In terms of margin, I think the way we think about it now is the customer, our customer, especially the moderate- to low-income customer, is really focused on value. So we'll look at every brand based off of how that brand sits in the world and the competitive nature of the pricing of that brand, and then we'll value it appropriately.\n Because that's really what the customer told us when we went in and we rightsized some of our values that we weren't as competitive as we would have been historically. So I would look at it more from the opportunity of getting great brands on the floor, putting better values out there to make -- to please the customer and then, ultimately, to drive sales. \nBrooke Roach: Great. And then just one quick follow-up. I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned a sequential improvement at dd's. Can you talk to the drivers of that and any change that you're seeing in the behavior of your low-income customer versus maybe more of a middle- to high-income customer within your portfolio? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On dd's, the improvement from Q2 to Q3 was similar than Ross, although it continued to trail. As a reminder, the dd's customers' average household income is $40,000 to $45,000 versus $60,000 to $65,000 for Ross. So very similar improvement between Q2 and Q3. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter. You guys are typically really conservative when it comes to the forward guidance. And others today and yesterday have spoken to a softer start to fourth quarter. Michael, I know you won't speak specifically about intra-quarter, but you mentioned maybe that fuel is going to neutralize some of the stimulus benefit in your biggest market, [ a few of your ] macro thoughts there. But what gives you the confidence to raise in the fourth quarter, knowing what we know about the industry here, a little different than how you approached a couple of the most recent quarters?\n And then, I guess, Michael, you've also saw spoken to us in the past about what your view is of a normal algorithm for this business, what flow-through looks like on your normal sales target. Any initial thoughts on how flow-through could look next year, if we're lucky enough to be back to a conducive market for a normal comp? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On what gives us confidence on the guidance, so the multiyear stack in the Q4 is lower than what we actually achieved in the third quarter. We're confident about the assortment that we have for the holidays. And any conservatism would be based on the macroeconomic environment and what we think is going to be a very, very promotional holiday.\n In terms of the flow-through for next year, as you would expect, operating margin improvements will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth over time and then how quickly some of the inflationary cost pressures subside. But I'd say, over the longer term, we think we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability.\n As for 2023 specifically, we're in the midst of our budgeting process for next year currently. And we'll be able to provide an update on our year-end call when we'll have a better sense of the macro economy entering the year and to the opportunities we have in places like ocean and domestic freight.\n I would say also, keep in mind, with lower incentive costs that had benefited our profitability this year, will reset the baseline next year. And thus, incentives will be a headwind in SG&A. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, can you talk about the buying environment and how much better it has gotten perhaps in the past 60 to 90 days since last quarter? And then how long does it take from, say, a contract negotiation to being able to get that product ready and available for sale in your stores? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Yes, the buying environment has gotten even better, broader, more brands, [ more ] classification. So it has -- absolutely, in the last 60 to 90 days, more vendors want to move more merchandise and also some new resources that perhaps we weren't doing business with before also want us to purchase the merchandise. So yes, there's a lot of supply out there. Adrienne, just say the second part of your question again. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes. I was wondering from the time that you actually negotiated... \nBarbara Rentler: Well, it depends how quickly a vendor can ship, right? So assuming I buy the goods on Monday and the vendor could ship in a week, probably takes about 3 to 4 weeks, depending upon what -- there's a lot of variables here, Adrienne, where they're shipping from, what DC, but basically as a general rule, I would say, somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Okay. Fantastic. Best of luck for holiday. Congrats. \nOperator: And Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: I'm interested in the contrast between what looks like more promotional department stores this year versus last and the off-price kind of effort to raise the ring a bit. How is your pricing umbrella holding up versus those mall-based stores this year? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, Laura, we went in and actually went in and rightsized some of our values, and we'll continue to do that in the fourth quarter, which is why we're saying, built into our guidance, we have some additional markdowns in there. The promotional calendar, I mean, you know what's going on out there, you can see it as everyone is trying to move through inventory.\n And some places, that -- the promotional calendar looks as sharp as '19, as deep as '19. A couple of businesses, you say to yourself, it's a little deeper than '19. But -- so the merchants are out there assessing that. And then we're either buying to the values that we think we need to be based off of all the supply that's out there, or we are going in and revaluing some of the things that we have that we think we need to get to the right price value.\n But it is just as promotional as it's been historically. And so that's kind of the heads-up the merchants have as they're out there now making purchases in the outside world. And then, of course, the logic of every value is dependent upon the brand and how that fits in the outside world. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations on a great quarter, and best of luck for holiday. If you could just -- I know you're not giving guidance yet for '23, but is it fair to assume that store openings will be about the same for next year? Or is there any change to your thinking on dd's, given the environment?\n And then I think, Barbara, just wanted to chase a little bit more into the improved mix you said for the holiday season. Clearly, there's a lot of product out there. But were you referring to improved mix versus '21, versus the first half, versus the third quarter or just in general, there's so much inventory and we're having a good time? \nMichael Hartshorn: Marni, on the real estate front, we remain very confident in both chains and currently have no changes to our expansion plans. Certainly, we'll provide more details for '23 when we report year-end earnings. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. And in terms of the mix, Marni, I would say, going back to Q4, we missed a lot of gifting opportunity last year because of the whole supply chain carrier issues. So specifically to Q4, that's one piece of it. In terms of versus the entire year, there's just a lot more brands out there. So I think it's a combination of both, being able to get really great closeouts and better pricing and better brands and the other piece of where there are just holes -- literally holes in our assortment. So it's both. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Congrats on the momentum into holiday. So Michael, if we look at your sales productivity just simply through sales per square foot, sales per store, it's above pre-COVID levels. The operating margin obviously is below, but it seems like there's momentum into the fourth quarter and next year, and you might have line of sight in terms of how to get back to pre-COVID levels of operating margin.\n What do you think is -- where do you have the clearest line of sight in terms of -- is it freight? Is it merchandise margin? Is it SG&A leverage? What do you think creates the clearest path back to pre-COVID levels of profitability? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, sales, number one. There are structural changes in wages across the U.S., but I don't think you're going to get that back to the labor that you had pre-COVID. Certainly, ocean freight is going to be a tailwind for us going into 2023. I would say domestic freight should be a tailwind as well, but that will be partly dependent on diesel fuel prices that are above $5 now. And so it will be partly dependent on what happens with fuel. But most importantly, it will depend on top line sales. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: My question is just, with all the inventory out there, not just in terms of apparel and footwear, but many categories, are you seeing any opportunities to expand the business into some new areas and new categories that maybe you have it before just because the buys are so good? \nBarbara Rentler: Look, I would say, the merchants are out there looking for all kinds of buys. And yes, that does happen. Often you wind up opening up some new resources, which we have, as there's availability and the vendors are looking to partner with people. So it's both. I mean we're absolutely doing that, and that's a piece of it. \nJay Sole: And Barbara, do you think that can continue? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, I think once you open up a resource or even start shopping a resource, even if the resource doesn't have merchandise that minute, usually, things over time, if you keep going back, you'll open the resource up. I think after this supply double really, really died down, and we do expect it to go into next year because there is so much merchandise, then I think there's a lot of -- we don't really have full line of sight to what will be full product set that's in front of us since this November.\n Yes. I just -- I think there's just -- yes, I don't know if -- I think there's opportunities and there are some businesses we could go into in some different categories, not whole businesses, but categories within businesses that we could expand upon. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nJesse Sobelson: This is Jesse Sobelson on for Ike. We were just wondering, as we look to pre-COVID margins, I think it was mentioned a little bit earlier in the Q&A, you're hovering around 13% pre-COVID. But you mentioned some higher structural costs such as wages. This pre-COVID margin is still attainable sometime over the next few years? Or should we be thinking about a recovery, but maybe landing somewhere below those pre-COVID levels? How are you guys thinking about it? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Jesse. I wouldn't predict where it's going to land other than any return would happen over a number of years and wouldn't happen overnight. We would expect it to have improved profitability over time is the way I'd answer that question. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: Barbara, on your point about resetting the value proposition, have you seen turns pick up sequentially through the quarter? And is that what drove the in-store inventories to be so lean as you continued to lean in on markdowns?\n And then, Adam, you mentioned earlier on an expectation of an easing of markdowns in Q4. Should we interpret that you're now reaching the level of turns that continue to be strong through the quarter and now you're happy with where your value proposition is? Have you seen the turns stay strong kind of exiting the quarter and into Q4? \nMichael Hartshorn: Aneesha, on absolute inventory levels, these are the inventory levels we've been running throughout the year. We always prefer to be in the chase. And this is the way we'll -- we typically run the model and will continue to do so going forward. But the inventory levels, again, in-store, in front of the customer were up over last year, but down versus pre-pandemic level. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. And, Aneesha, building on that a little bit. Your question about the markdowns, we've layered some additional markdowns versus last year into our fourth quarter guidance. And that's really largely driven. We know this is going to be a highly promotional environment, and we'll see how highly promotional it is, but just want to be prepared for that. \nAneesha Sherman: But can I clarify, Adam, so it's up versus last year, but is it right to say that it's easing sequentially versus where you were this quarter? \nAdam Orvos: Yes, absolutely. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Congrats on the quarter. So on new stores, I was wondering if you -- I know you talked about completing your 2022 store growth plans. I was wondering if you could discuss a little bit about new store productivity, how that's looking versus what your benchmarks are and any additional color that you can add specifically on just the new store performance. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. So for us, a new store overall in the fleet of stores will typically come out of the box at 60% to 65% of the chain average. And that continues to be the case, even on the new store openings over the last couple of years. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. \nRobert Drbul: Just 2 quick questions. On, I guess, dd's versus Ross, are the state performances, Texas, Florida versus California, what you said, is that holding true for both formats in terms of the sales performance? And then just on the other side of it, in terms of your mix or your opportunity in categories, what do you think in terms of where you outperformed your expectation in the third quarter, like which categories surprised you the most, I would say? Could you share that with us? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the dd's question, we typically -- the state performance is really on a consolidated basis, which is what we discussed. We don't get into the dd's -- again, I would just reiterate that overall, dd's improvement, I would say, across the board was very similar to Ross, but continued to trail. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of merchandise mix of performance, it outperformed -- I mean shoes really outperformed. The other businesses that outperformed would be some of the standard core businesses. From a term perspective, [ that would be ] the plan. \nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nDaniel Stroller: This is Dan Stroller on for Simeon. On the topic of margin recapture, I think in the past, you've talked about leveraging added technology in-store or at the DCs for efficiency and cost reductions. Just wondering where you stand in that regard, or if there's more to come, basically what inning you're in, in that chapter. \nMichael Hartshorn: I would answer that by saying we're constantly in the third or fourth inning. So we always have new investments we're making. Those include automation in the DCs, in stores. They're ranging from automated robotics in the DCs. We're piloting self-checkout in the stores, and also in the stores, more efficient ways to check inventory and take markdowns for our store associates. And we constantly have investments where we're trying to be more productive and efficient in the business. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And now I would like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance, followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, third quarter results were above our expectations as we delivered stronger values throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 9.8% versus 11.4% last year, reflecting the deleveraging effect from the comparable sales decline as well as pressure from higher markdowns and unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 29, 2022, were $1 on net income of $342 million. This compares to $1.09 per share or net earnings of $385 million for the 13 weeks ended October 30, 2021. Total sales for the quarter were $4.6 billion, in line with the prior year, with comparable sales down 3% on top of a robust 14% gain in the third quarter of 2021.\n For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.08 on net earnings of $1.1 billion compared to $3.82 per share on net income of $1.4 billion for the same period in 2021. Sales for the year-to-date period totaled $13.5 billion with comparable store sales down 5% versus a strong 14% increase last year.\n For the third quarter at Ross, shoes was the best-performing business, while Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions as they were bolstered by the outperformance of border and tourist locations.\n At dd's DISCOUNTS, sales trends improved versus the first half, but continued to trail Ross' results due to ongoing inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. Inventory levels moderated significantly from the first half of the year, with total consolidated inventories at the end of the quarter up 12% compared to last year.\n Average store inventories during the quarter were up 4% versus 2021 and down compared to pre-pandemic levels. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of the total compared to 31% last year when we used packaway merchandise to fuel robust sales gains.\n Turning to store growth. We completed our expansion program for 2022 with the addition of 28 new Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS in the third quarter. For the year, we added a total of 99 locations comprised of 71 Ross and 28 dd's DISCOUNTS. We now expect to end the year with 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd's DISCOUNTS locations for a net increase of 92 stores.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. Thank you, Adam. Despite the many challenges over the last few years, coupled with today's uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we remain optimistic about our future growth prospects. Our top priority is and always will be delivering fresh and exciting named brand merchandise at compelling discounts every day in our growing store base of over 2,000 locations.\n With consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience, this bodes well for our ability to expand our market share and profitability in the future. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. Okay. The holiday assortment, so look, we believe our holiday assortment this year, we really have an improved offering of both branded bargains based off of availability in the marketplace and also particularly our gift giving, because of the imbalances we had from the supply chain congestion, as Michael just alluded to. So we feel between the 2 of those, we'd be able to offer great brands, strong values and a broader assortment. Sure. From the second quarter to the third quarter, from an assortment perspective, we went in and reset our values and got them to where we believe they need to be in this very promotional environment. So we rightsized our values through some markdowns in some places. And in some places, we rightsized some of our inventory as we were watching shifts go on in the business.\n And the other big shift is apparel and home for us in the quarter performed relatively the same, but our shoe business, which was our best performing business, was really, really fueled by strong values on branded products and availability in the market. Sure. So Lorraine, value and price are 2 different things. So the merchants are out constantly assessing what's going on from pricing and competitive shopping and seeing what that is. So in some places, where we felt that our AUR was just too high, we went in and took markdowns. But in other places, based off of assortments and opportunities that we've gotten in the marketplace, the AUR might be higher, but the value is different.\n And then the last component would be some of the shift in the mix of some of the businesses themselves. So for example, our shoe business has been strong. And shoes, obviously, runs a much higher AUR. So there's a variety of things.\n But what I would say in total is that, with back to being such a highly promotional environment that we're in, the merchants will be in the market, really assessing where the values are moving and what that looks like and trying to stay ahead of that. So with -- again, back to the AUR question, that could depend on mix, and that can depend on brand. So there's a variety of issues involved there. Sure. As you know, there's a lot of availability in the market, and it's really broad-based. And all categories, all brands, it's really broad. In terms of margin, I think the way we think about it now is the customer, our customer, especially the moderate- to low-income customer, is really focused on value. So we'll look at every brand based off of how that brand sits in the world and the competitive nature of the pricing of that brand, and then we'll value it appropriately.\n Because that's really what the customer told us when we went in and we rightsized some of our values that we weren't as competitive as we would have been historically. So I would look at it more from the opportunity of getting great brands on the floor, putting better values out there to make -- to please the customer and then, ultimately, to drive sales. Sure. Yes, the buying environment has gotten even better, broader, more brands, [ more ] classification. So it has -- absolutely, in the last 60 to 90 days, more vendors want to move more merchandise and also some new resources that perhaps we weren't doing business with before also want us to purchase the merchandise. So yes, there's a lot of supply out there. Adrienne, just say the second part of your question again. Well, it depends how quickly a vendor can ship, right? So assuming I buy the goods on Monday and the vendor could ship in a week, probably takes about 3 to 4 weeks, depending upon what -- there's a lot of variables here, Adrienne, where they're shipping from, what DC, but basically as a general rule, I would say, somewhere between 3 to 4 weeks. Well, Laura, we went in and actually went in and rightsized some of our values, and we'll continue to do that in the fourth quarter, which is why we're saying, built into our guidance, we have some additional markdowns in there. The promotional calendar, I mean, you know what's going on out there, you can see it as everyone is trying to move through inventory.\n And some places, that -- the promotional calendar looks as sharp as '19, as deep as '19. A couple of businesses, you say to yourself, it's a little deeper than '19. But -- so the merchants are out there assessing that. And then we're either buying to the values that we think we need to be based off of all the supply that's out there, or we are going in and revaluing some of the things that we have that we think we need to get to the right price value.\n But it is just as promotional as it's been historically. And so that's kind of the heads-up the merchants have as they're out there now making purchases in the outside world. And then, of course, the logic of every value is dependent upon the brand and how that fits in the outside world. Okay. And in terms of the mix, Marni, I would say, going back to Q4, we missed a lot of gifting opportunity last year because of the whole supply chain carrier issues. So specifically to Q4, that's one piece of it. In terms of versus the entire year, there's just a lot more brands out there. So I think it's a combination of both, being able to get really great closeouts and better pricing and better brands and the other piece of where there are just holes -- literally holes in our assortment.

Well, I think once you open up a resource or even start shopping a resource, even if the resource doesn't have merchandise that minute, usually, things over time, if you keep going back, you'll open the resource up. I think after this supply double really, really died down, and we do expect it to go into next year because there is so much merchandise, then I think there's a lot of -- we don't really have full line of sight to what will be full product set that's in front of us since this November.\n Yes. I just -- I think there's just -- yes, I don't know if -- I think there's opportunities and there are some businesses we could go into in some different categories, not whole businesses, but categories within businesses that we could expand upon.

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales were down 3% in the quarter. Although traffic improved from the second quarter, it still declined versus the prior year. Partially offsetting these declines was a higher average basket size.\n Operating margin of 9.8% for the third quarter was down 160 basis points from last year. Cost of goods sold grew by 230 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin declined 165 basis points, primarily due to higher markdowns.\n Distribution costs were up 140 basis points, mainly due to unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy delevered by 20 basis points. These higher expenses were partially offset by a 75 basis point decrease in buying costs, mainly from lower incentives.\n Lastly, pressure from domestic freight expenses eased in the third quarter and improved 20 basis points as we anniversaried the freight headwinds that began in the second half of last year.\n SG&A for the period improved by 70 basis points as deleverage from the negative comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentives. During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $244 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to expect a very promotional holiday selling season and ongoing inflationary headwinds to pressure our low- to moderate-income customers. That said, we face our easiest sales and earnings comparisons in the fourth quarter and are raising our guidance, given our third quarter sales momentum and improved holiday assortments.\n For the 13 weeks ending January 28, 2023, we now expect comparable store sales to be flat to down 2% on top of a 9% gain in the prior year. As a result, earnings per share are forecasted to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.26. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to be flat to up 3%. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 9.7% to 10.5% versus 9.8% last year.\n This mainly reflects the anniversarying of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives, partially offset by the deleveraging effect from lower same-store sales, unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs and higher markdowns.\n Net interest income is estimated to be about $14 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. And weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 342 million. Based on our year-to-date results and fourth quarter guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now projected to be in the range of $4.21 to $4.34 compared to $4.87 last year.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes, sure. Alex, this is Adam. So given our guidance of flat to minus 2% comps, we'll have some deleverage impact from sales. Markdowns will be higher than last year in fourth quarter, but not as impactful as in third quarter. Domestic freight, we see as slightly neutral, seeing some benefit in rate, but offset by still elevated fuel prices. Ocean freight will probably be the most tangible tailwind for us.\n As you remember, last year, we were getting into the period where rates were escalating significantly, demand was high. So that will be a tailwind for us. And then given our outperformance last year and our underperformance this year, incentive costs will be lower in Q4 versus last year. And then finally, depending how the end of the year plays out, we'll likely see some pressure from packaway timing in fourth quarter also. Yes. This is Adam, Chuck. Yes, Florida and Texas clearly outperformed for us. We're seeing the benefit in border locations. We're seeing the benefit in tourism locations. And those were clearly the outperformers. On the flip side, California underperformed in the quarter. Yes. And, Aneesha, building on that a little bit. Your question about the markdowns, we've layered some additional markdowns versus last year into our fourth quarter guidance. And that's really largely driven. We know this is going to be a highly promotional environment, and we'll see how highly promotional it is, but just want to be prepared for that. Yes, absolutely."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "On the traffic trends, as we mentioned -- this is Michael Hartshorn, Matt. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, with the comp down 3%, as we mentioned, traffic did improve for the quarter, but it still declined versus the prior year. So offsetting the traffic decline was a higher average basket.\n The basket was driven by higher AURs, while UPTs were flattish. The increase in the average basket was more than offset by the decline in the number of transactions. As we move through the quarter, what we saw on a stacked basis, so compared to 2019, our trends improved as we progressed through the quarter. I would say the -- from our point of view, the macroeconomic environment obviously remains uncertain, but we do think that the holiday period is going to be very promotional. So that's what we've embedded into the guidance. And then just as a reminder, last year, sales at the end of the quarter did trail off. It's our easiest quarterly compare. Trailed off for 2 main reasons. One was the spike in Omicron cases. And then at this point last year, the supply chain continued to be a real challenge for us and other retailers. Overall, we feel really good about where we are at the end of the third quarter. As we said in the prepared remarks, we ended up about 12%, which was a big improvement when we -- from the second quarter when we were up 55%. And the increase over the last year is really packaway inventory. So we were at 41% versus 31% last year. And last year was relatively low versus our historical levels because we used a substantial amount of our packaway to chase sales that were well above our plan. And in terms of the trade-down customer, with so many moving parts in the economy, it's difficult to parse out the individual drivers of the improvement. We have not seen a material shift with spending trends across different income demographics, but delivering better bargains to our consumer likely played the most significant role as it typically does. And on California, the checks didn't come out till the end of the quarter, so it didn't have a material impact on Q3. In California, fuel prices have remained significantly more elevated than the rest of the country. That is, we believe, squeezing the lower- to moderate-income customer. Well, on physical inventory, we did take a physical inventory during the third quarter, and it was slightly higher than last year. And then on inventory levels in Q2, we were -- we believe we had too much inventory, which is why it's down versus the second quarter. I wouldn't comment on the -- on year-end, but it's going to be dependent on packaway opportunities in the marketplace. Sure. On dd's, the improvement from Q2 to Q3 was similar than Ross, although it continued to trail. As a reminder, the dd's customers' average household income is $40,000 to $45,000 versus $60,000 to $65,000 for Ross. So very similar improvement between Q2 and Q3. Sure. On what gives us confidence on the guidance, so the multiyear stack in the Q4 is lower than what we actually achieved in the third quarter. We're confident about the assortment that we have for the holidays. And any conservatism would be based on the macroeconomic environment and what we think is going to be a very, very promotional holiday.\n In terms of the flow-through for next year, as you would expect, operating margin improvements will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth over time and then how quickly some of the inflationary cost pressures subside. But I'd say, over the longer term, we think we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability.\n As for 2023 specifically, we're in the midst of our budgeting process for next year currently. And we'll be able to provide an update on our year-end call when we'll have a better sense of the macro economy entering the year and to the opportunities we have in places like ocean and domestic freight.\n I would say also, keep in mind, with lower incentive costs that had benefited our profitability this year, will reset the baseline next year. And thus, incentives will be a headwind in SG&A. Marni, on the real estate front, we remain very confident in both chains and currently have no changes to our expansion plans. Certainly, we'll provide more details for '23 when we report year-end earnings. Well, sales, number one. There are structural changes in wages across the U.S., but I don't think you're going to get that back to the labor that you had pre-COVID. Certainly, ocean freight is going to be a tailwind for us going into 2023. I would say domestic freight should be a tailwind as well, but that will be partly dependent on diesel fuel prices that are above $5 now. And so it will be partly dependent on what happens with fuel. But most importantly, it will depend on top line sales. Sure, Jesse. I wouldn't predict where it's going to land other than any return would happen over a number of years and wouldn't happen overnight. We would expect it to have improved profitability over time is the way I'd answer that question. Aneesha, on absolute inventory levels, these are the inventory levels we've been running throughout the year. We always prefer to be in the chase. And this is the way we'll -- we typically run the model and will continue to do so going forward. But the inventory levels, again, in-store, in front of the customer were up over last year, but down versus pre-pandemic level. Sure. So for us, a new store overall in the fleet of stores will typically come out of the box at 60% to 65% of the chain average. And that continues to be the case, even on the new store openings over the last couple of years. Sure. On the dd's question, we typically -- the state performance is really on a consolidated basis, which is what we discussed. We don't get into the dd's -- again, I would just reiterate that overall, dd's improvement, I would say, across the board was very similar to Ross, but continued to trail. I would answer that by saying we're constantly in the third or fourth inning. So we always have new investments we're making. Those include automation in the DCs, in stores. They're ranging from automated robotics in the DCs. We're piloting self-checkout in the stores, and also in the stores, more efficient ways to check inventory and take markdowns for our store associates. And we constantly have investments where we're trying to be more productive and efficient in the business."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. \n These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2022 performance, followed by our updated outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our sales results, which were impacted by the mounting inflationary pressures our customers faced as well as an increasingly promotional retail environment. Earnings came in above our guidance range, primarily due to lower incentive costs resulting from the below-plan top line performance. \n Total sales for the period were $4.6 billion versus $4.8 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales were down 7% compared to a robust 15% increase in last year's second quarter, which was our strongest period of 2021. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022, were $1.11 on net income of $385 million. These results compared to $1.39 per share on net earnings of $494 million for last year's second quarter. \n For the first 6 months, earnings per share were $2.08 on net income of $723 million. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.73 on net earnings of $971 million in the first half of 2021. \n Sales for the 2022 year-to-date period were $8.9 billion with comparable sales down 7% versus a strong 14% gain in the first half of 2021. Shoes and men's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter. Both Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions, mainly due to the outperformance of our border and tourist locations. We are making merchandising adjustments to meet changing customer demand. That said, the actions we have taken thus far were unable to offset the mounting financial pressures on our low- to moderate-income consumers and the impact on our business from an increasingly promotional retail environment. \n Similar to the first quarter, dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the second quarter continued to be well below Ross's, mainly due to today's escalating inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 55% versus the same period in 2021. While average store inventory during the quarter were up 15% versus last year, we operated with very similar levels when compared to pre-pandemic. \n Packaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventory versus 30% in the same period of the prior year when we used a substantial amount of packaways to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion continued to ease during the second quarter, resulting in above-plan early receipts of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores throughout the fall season.  Looking ahead, we expect these early receipts to wane and to have the appropriate inventory levels in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 21 new Ross and 8 dd\u2019s DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as a decline in the number of transactions versus the prior year was partially offset by an increase in the size of the average basket. Second quarter operating margin was 11.3% compared to 14.1% in 2021. This decline was due to a combination of deleveraging effect on expenses from the decrease in same-store sales, higher markdowns and ongoing headwinds from higher freight costs that did not begin to escalate until the second half of 2021. \n These expense pressures were partially offset by lower incentive costs that were much higher last year when we significantly outperformed our plans. We also saw a decline in COVID expenses versus last year's second quarter. Cost of goods sold during the period increased by 320 basis points. Merchandise margin declined 205 basis points due to both higher ocean freight costs and markdowns. Distribution costs increased 85 basis points due to a combination of unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy and domestic freight rose by 55 and 35 basis points, respectively. \n Partially offsetting these higher costs were buying expenses that improved by 60 basis points, again due to lower incentives. SG&A for the period levered by 40 basis points as deleverage from the lower comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentive and COVID costs. \n During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $235 million. As previously announced, we expect to buy back $950 million of common stock during fiscal 2022 under our 2-year $1.9 billion repurchase program that extends through fiscal 2023. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our recent results as well as the increasingly unpredictable macroeconomic landscape in today's more promotional retail environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending October 29, 2022, to decline 7% to 9% on top of a strong 14% gain last year. \n For the fourth quarter, same-store sales are planned to be down 4% to 7% versus a 9% increase in the last quarter of 2021. As noted in our press release, if the second half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $0.72 to $0.83 versus $1.09 last year and $1.04 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.04 in 2021. Based on our first half results and second half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now planned to be in the range of $3.84 to $4.12 versus $4.87 last year. \n Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2022. Total sales are forecasted to decline 4% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 41 locations during the quarter, including 29 Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 7.8% to 8.7% range versus 11.4% in 2021, primarily reflecting the deleverage on the same-store sales decline. In addition, merchandise margin is forecast to be pressured by ongoing increases in ocean freight costs. We are also projecting higher markdowns to right-size our inventory levels given the lower revenue forecast and adjust pricing as we expect an increasingly promotional retail environment. \n Lastly, third quarter operating margin also reflects unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $400,000. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 345 million. \n Finally, I want to emphasize that Ross continues to be in a strong financial position with significant resources to manage through today's challenging economic and retail landscape. Our healthy balance sheet includes $5.2 billion in total liquidity with $3.9 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in untapped borrowing capacity. We also continue to return large amounts of cash to stockholders with a cumulative total of $1.4 billion expected to be paid out under our stock repurchase and dividend programs in 2022. Now I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. We are facing a very difficult and uncertain macroeconomic environment that we expect will continue to strain our customers' discretionary spending. Though 2022 will likely remain a challenging year for our company, we believe our value-focused business model and our strong financial position will enable us to manage through these economic pressures and rebound over time. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: So you've included a better fourth quarter comp versus 3Q in your guidance. Can you talk about the areas of opportunity that you see in the fourth quarter? And also, what gives you confidence that things will improve? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's Michael Hartshorn. First, on the fourth quarter guidance alone, if you look at the multiyear compare, we did a 9% last year. So it's one of the easiest compares, which is really the driver of the 4% to 7% comp this year in guidance. \nBarbara Rentler: So Lorraine, in terms of opportunities in terms of the fourth quarter, I think that would be around gifting -- that we didn't maximize some of our gifting areas last year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Sorry if I missed it, but curious about the performance of home versus apparel and if there were any notable trends in those categories, how they trend throughout the quarter, get worse, get better. And I'm also curious if you think the comp shortfall was all macro driven or if you attribute any sort of execution issues that might have also factored in. \nBarbara Rentler: Home sales are relatively in line with the chain average and the performance of home and apparel was pretty similar for the quarter. Both businesses had areas of business that were strong and areas of business that were weaker, so they were relatively in line. \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, on the macro, I mean, of course, there are things that we know we could have done better in the business. In terms of trends during the quarter, we outperformed earlier in the quarter, both on a single-year and a multiyear basis.  \n And I think if you looked across retail, I think people weakened in the back half of the quarter. Obviously, fuel prices peaked in June so a portion of the performance is certainly driven by the macroeconomic environment. \nPaul Lejuez: I think some have also seen a little bit of an improvement at the end of July into August. Anything you can share on that front? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. We wouldn't comment on trends within this next quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Okay. Great. Barbara, on the last call, you talked about the very significant shift you were seeing in the kinds of categories and the types of products that Ross shoppers were buying and how much that had changed by April and May compared to when we started the year.  \n I know you were working here through the second quarter to reposition inventory and sort of pivot toward those categories. I'm wondering if you can just talk about where you are on that journey, the progress you made in the second quarter and what -- where you sit today, what's your evaluation of the progress? And is there still more to go in the second half of the year? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. The pivot was to take us out of casual product into more things that the customer wanted. So more wear-to-work in men's and ladies, more social, more going out-type products, whether that would have been in shoes or ready-to-wear.  \n That's really where the main shift was on the apparel side. We've made some progress there, but we certainly have a longer way to go. But I feel much better about where we were -- from where we were in Q1 to where we are now because we've really been able to expand some of those assortments when I felt like we were a little bit behind.  \n So -- and then in terms of go forward, we're going to meet whatever the customer demand is. So with everything that is so difficult out there, a highly promotional environment, we're going to see where the customer tells us, where and when what she wants, and then we'll make the shift from there. But we feel like we're in a better state of balance between, let's say, casual and more wear-to-work products in men's and ladies. \nKimberly Greenberger: Fantastic. That's really helpful, Barbara. And just one follow-up on the product. Are you starting to see new vendors come to Ross? Maybe vendors that you didn't work with last year or in 2020?  I'm just wondering if the more robust buying environment is yielding an opportunity to maybe work with additional vendors that you haven't seen for the last year or 2. \nBarbara Rentler: The answer to that is yes. Both new vendors or vendors that perhaps, we hadn't seen availability from for an extended period of time, the availability out there is pretty broad-based right now in all products and a good -- better basket. There's just a lot of merchandise in the country.  \n And so I think vendors themselves are looking to expand their business. And if they haven't been doing business with us, at least it was an opportunity. So yes, I think that -- and I think that probably will continue based on the amount of inventory that's in the country. \nKimberly Greenberger: Terrific. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Barbara, how do you balance taking advantage of the great deals in the marketplace today versus waiting for better deals down the road?  Because I imagine the deals today look a lot better than they did a few months ago than those you're getting today. And I guess as a follow-up, when should we expect those to start showing up in the P&L for you, guys? Is that a third and fourth quarter phenomenon? Or do we start to see that in '23? \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. Just first, in terms of the deals, it was a good deal today just to get better as we go. The merchants are really out there in the market shopping to see what's out there, shopping to see what the availability is. And to assess where the product is the best product is [ going to happen ]. There is a lot of product out there. What you really want to do is get the best product at the best price, so the merchants are out there assessing what that looks like. And then you really want to get the most desirable product, right?  \n So if it's the best product and you think that's a really sharp price and something you haven't been able to really get or [ deploy ], you're going to pull the trigger and buy it. If there's a lot of -- if there's products where there's lots and lots of availability, you might buy some metered in, you might pack some away for the following year.  \n I mean, it's not just one kind of cookie-cutter answer here. I think that the key thing now for the merchants is really to be out there understanding the promotional environment, right? So when you're buying goods now, what you really have to be attuned to is what is the right value.  \n So the buyers have to be very strategic in terms of buying the right merchandise at the appropriate value for customers, given the current inflationary environment. So I think it's supply, and it's really studying what's going on in the outside world with so much inventory sitting in retail stores, with the inflated inventory and a more promotional environment, which I think we all believe is probably going to get more heightened in the fourth quarter.  \n So there's a variety of things that need to happen there, so I don't think it's quite the cookie-cutter. So to get to, I think we'll see some for this year. I think there'll be some packaway for spring, and there may even potentially be some packaway for fall. But we have to wait and see what that looks like. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Great. Barbara, so larger picture, on the mounting inflationary pressure that you cited on your customer, how does this affect the value and convenience elements of your model? Or is there anything that you're seeing today that's different than past times of consumer disruption where your model actually outperforms over time?  \n And then Adam, while sales are below your target model today, are there any structural underlying changes to the models margin as we think about multiyear in your view? \nBarbara Rentler: So Matthew, in terms of mounting inflation, I think over the last few months, we had initially made strategic price increases. And I think with the slowing consumer demand and the escalating inflationary pressures, it all comes down to value. And so for us to be successful, we really need to make sure that we understand the value of what's going on around us and get ourselves really highly focused on that because that really, in the end, is what will make us successful.  \n Our customer is looking for branded bargains, great values every day. That's what she's come to expect for 40 years, and that's what she expects from us now. So I think that really comes down to the merchants being in the market, understanding the availability, understanding what's going on and then knowing when to pull the trigger and to drive it because that's what helped us from 2008 to 2009. \n And I think that, that will help -- what will help us here also in getting ourselves in the right value when the customer is under so much pressure with all the macroeconomic issues that are out there. \nAdam Orvos: And Matthew, this is Adam. So we don't see anything structurally different in our model, still feel bullish about the environment, the retail environment in our model going forward. When we talk about multiyear and think about 2023, specifically, I think the key is we're going to have to see how the inflationary aspects play out in the second half.  That's obviously a critical variable. How we plan sales next year, profitability will be highly dependent on that kind of top line assumption. \nMichael Hartshorn: Matthew, just to add to that, obviously, since the pre-pandemic, the changes have been really around the cost in the business, and those are acutely in 2 different places with wages and transportation, whether domestically or on imports. I think what we expect to see is both the domestic and import costs to come down over time.  \n We're already starting to see some break in those costs here in the back half, especially on the import costs. So I think those will come down, which will be a benefit to us. On the wage front, I think the increases we saw during COVID are structural at the current levels and are at least at this level.  \n What I'd say about the wage market right now is it's still tight, but it is stable, which is much different from where we were last year when we were getting people back to work and there was frenzied demand in the U.S.  \n So I think there is going to be some opportunity in cost as the transportation comes down with the lower demand in the U.S. \nMatthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. Barbara,  this is sort of more of an opinion question for you. I'm wondering if you believe that the aggressive discretionary promotions at Walmart and Target are maybe temporarily taking some market share away.  \n And I guess in the past, when they aren't as promotional, might that alleviate kind of some of the kind of market share shifts that are going on? So that's my first question. \n And then for Michael, can you talk about any price pass-through attempts, if any?  And I know that you guys have been very, very careful about that. And what does your average unit cost look like at this point kind of heading into holiday? \nBarbara Rentler: Adrienne, as it pertains to Walmart, look, I think we look at everyone as a competitor, whether it's Walmart, whether it's the other off-pricers, whether it's Macy's. I think there's a lot of opportunities for the consumer to buy bargains now and whether it's Walmart or Target, whoever it is, and so it's hard for us to measure that.  \n I think the most important thing that we can do now is really, we need to understand value. And we need to understand where we need to be on the value equation with the customer. And that is a shift from where we were. So I think it's very -- it's hard for us to measure that.  \n But again, it's more competition. And they have both been very aggressive in their pricing, as we all know, to move through some goods. So that's our job to understand it. \nMichael Hartshorn: On pricing, what we saw during the quarter on AUR, so AURs were up during the quarter. As we said in the commentary, the minus 7% comp was a function of lower traffic and higher basket. The basket was really driven by a higher AUR.  \n What we'd expect for the fall season with us really trying to drive value and with our additional markdowns, we'd expect AURs to moderate versus the first half over the balance of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: I guess for Michael or Adam, the sales outlook is slightly better in Q4 versus Q3, though the magnitude of the implied margin inflection, I think, is fairly significant if I'm reading it all correctly.  \n Is that primarily markdowns in Q3 that are expected to be kind of cleared through by Q4? Or are there kind of other things that are going on there? \nMichael Hartshorn: Just on Q4, as I mentioned in Lorraine's question, that was our lowest comp last year, and that was a function of, one, with supply chain congestion, we didn't get all the goods we wanted to in the stores before the holiday, and there was also an Omicron spike leading up to Christmas that dampened traffic a bit.  So that should be a benefit versus last year. \n And then the fourth quarter was the peak of our cost increases, including incentives, and cost in the business, whether it was ocean freight or wage increases to staff in the store and the DCs for holiday. So we're up against that, and that will be a benefit versus last year. \nAdam Orvos: And Mark, this is Adam. Just to build on that, I think when you look at timing in third quarter versus fourth quarter, ocean freight probably is still headwinds as we move into third quarter just based on the comparison to LY and then probably some favorability, specifically in ocean freight in fourth quarter, and then probably a little bit more timing impact from our packaway cost in third quarter versus fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: Barbara, I'd like to ask you if you're seeing any evidence of trade-down in your business. Are you seeing any new customer acquisition above and beyond traditional levels from customers that typically don't shop Ross Stores?  \n And then maybe as a follow-up, you commented on plans to adjust pricing and markdowns in the third quarter. Can you comment on the magnitude and the time line to achieve a more normalized markdown level and when you might be a little bit more clean? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the consumer, we're not seeing any change, certainly. Since -- if I take the first to the second quarter with our comps, they've been relatively consistent. The composition of comps have been relatively consistent. If I compare it to when we started to lap the stimulus from last year, and our customer surveys and our own performance would suggest that where we're really seeing pressure is the lower-end consumer.  But on the trade-down customer, there's no indication that is in our data that would suggest that that's happening. \nBarbara Rentler: But we do serve a wide range of customers. Today, we serve a wide range of customers. So we're going to watch trends closely and then we'll make merchandising adjustments accordingly. So it would probably take us some time to see because our range of customers is so broad. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: I just want to make sure I have -- I understand. I'm thinking alongside you guys on the model. I think that as we look at like the 3-year growth rate in third quarter -- in the fourth quarter, take like a 2- to 3-point step down in the way that you're guiding fourth quarter is -- but you're expecting markdowns to ramp, which I would assume are going to give you a good shot of bringing in a new customer.  \n Is that deceleration? I'm curious what the deceleration is based on. Is that based on your insights for the industry slowing? Or Barb, you just mentioned you're hopeful that trade-down can start to happen after some period of time. Do you not bake that in, in fourth quarter? Maybe some help on how you're thinking about that deceleration. \nMichael Hartshorn: Michael, it's really a function -- it's our biggest quarter. It bodes -- serves us well to be very cautious, especially after missing 2 quarters in a row on top line, so we are being cautious in the fourth quarter. And we do think it's going to be a very promotional environment, so that's what it's based on. \nBarbara Rentler: Right. And also, based off the supply lines in the world, if, in fact, the trends line turns out to be better than we think it is, we're going to be able to chase some of that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: I just want to talk about the packaway inventory, up in year-over-year as a percent of inventory and in dollars, up pretty meaningfully. I know you're not going to go into specifics. But just curiously, maybe at a high level, can you talk about the buying margins, the closeout margins you guys are basically seeing today versus, I don't know, 12 months ago, 18 months ago? Are they starting to ramp up?  \n Where -- how does that look maybe versus, again, like I said, 12 months ago or maybe versus history? Just any kind of color at a high level would be interesting. \nMichael Hartshorn: Ike, first, on the -- on what we have in packaway. We are up as a percentage of total inventory, but that is up against last year when we were using a lot of our packaway in the frenzied demand in the second quarter, which was our top comp for 2021.  \n And then also, packaway right now includes early receipts of merchandise, and that's mainly home product. And what happened there is that last year, we're experiencing longer lead times. We were having difficulty getting products on time and on plan. So what we did this year is extended our lead times coming into the first quarter in our ordering cycle.  \n What we saw in the first quarter is those -- surprisingly, lead times improved, but we kept the longer lead times in the second quarter because we were concerned about port labor negotiations in L.A. and also COVID -- continuing COVID shutdowns in China.  \n Neither of those risks played out and with lower demand in the U.S., lead times actually improved. So we have stored in packaway early receipts of home that will flow in the back half of the year. \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of margins on closeouts and upfront, it's hard to compare 1 year to another based on -- it's hard to compare what I bought this year versus what I had historically, so it's not necessarily quite as simple as just as going, here's the pitch on it.\n So I think it remains to be seen on the closeout rates. We've seen what kind of values we need to put on the floor and what availability, when people want to move it. It's a measured balance. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: Great. I just want to dig into the AUR strategy for the back half of the year. Are you saying that you're going to use AUR as a lever to try to take share and alleviate some of the traffic issue that you've had recently? \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Listen, we're in the value business. And in the last couple of quarters, we've really -- we've made some strategic price increases. And the customer, based on slowing demand and inflationary pressures, has voted that she doesn't necessarily think the value is where it needs to be.  \n So yes, if we could get -- we want to get our AUR more in line, and we want to offer the customer more value. And the AUR can move around based off of mix, right, because it doesn't necessarily mean depending upon what types of products you have on the floor, the AUR can move.  \n I think the word we're looking here is for value. And clearly, the more value we offer the customer, history would tell us that we would perform better. So that is our strategy. I mean based off of where she is and the pressure that the customer is under, that's really what we need to do. We need to understand what the outside world is doing and we need to offer better value. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Good afternoon, everyone. As you see the differences between the Ross and the dd's chain, what are the differences between the 2? And whether it's traffic or whether it's product sell-through and what you're saying? And is your AUR strategy at all different with dd's and Ross in terms of magnitude for the back half of the year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana on dd's, so similar to Q1, dd's performance in Q2 continued to be well below Ross, although up against very robust comps last year. The inflationary pressure here has even a larger impact on the dd's low-income customer.  \n dd's average household income is $40,000 to $45,000. Therefore, this customer is obviously more sensitive to the pressures in fuel and food costs and other inflationary purchases. I would say like Ross, our focus is on delivering the best bargains, but we need to even provide greater value to the dd's customer. And like Ross, we built in higher markdowns in the back half of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: I've got a couple. So when do you think that logistics costs will start to ease? And then secondly, you mentioned more clearance activity in Q3. When do you think that inventories come more in line with sales trends, assuming that's a goal given the packaway opportunities you see? \nMichael Hartshorn: Laura, it's Mike. On logistics cost, we're already seeing them. They already seemed to have peaked and have started to come down. I think it's different between domestic and ocean freight. I think ocean freight, there are a lot of long-term contracts that it may take some time to come down. But certainly, the current noncontract market is below the contract rate. So we're starting to see some movement even on contract rates. \n Domestic, at least for us, we expect domestic costs to be relatively neutral in the back half because we started seeing them rising in the back half of last year. But I suspect over time, both of them will come down and maybe not to the levels that we saw pre-pandemic though. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of the inventory level coming down, we see that moving as it goes throughout the fall. But with that, we have liquidity, and we're comfortable with our liquidity. And so we have -- open to buy to take advantage of opportunities. So it's kind of 2 things going on at the same time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: So if I heard it right, the in-store inventory levels at the moment are about in line with what you saw pre-pandemic. So just trying to understand the rationale for the higher markdowns you're doing now as well as into the second half. Is it about your product mix and you're seeing slowing trends in certain categories in the rebalancing?  Or is it more about benchmarking to the external environment that's becoming more promotional? What's the bigger driver of the markdowns you expect? \nBarbara Rentler: I think it's a combination of both. But I think the promotional environment has gotten so aggressive in such a short period of time that we need to make the move on the goods. Otherwise, we're not offering the customer the value that she wants and needs, and so that's played a big part of it.  \n And then there's always -- there always is. There's always businesses that aren't good or they need to take markdowns more aggressively. But that's really -- it's the promotional cadence and just really watching where the AUR is in the outside world and being very, very conscious of that and understanding that.  So getting -- the faster we get to the value equation that she really wants, the better our performance will be. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Barbara, you mentioned realigning the value equation to where you think it needs to be. And with that, are there any cost savings initiatives that you have in place to help to kind of underpin the profitability and the profit goals that you have for the remainder of this year? \nMichael Hartshorn: I would say from an expense structure standpoint, we absolutely have put in places, whether using technology in the stores or automation in our distribution centers, which is our big pockets of expense, we've continued to add new capabilities in stores and in the distribution centers to increase efficiency and reduce costs. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. And then as it relates to the store opportunity and real estate and the rent structures and your lease renewals, are you seeing anything incrementally helpful on the expense side there as well? \nMichael Hartshorn: I wouldn't say there's anything material in that renewal process, but we will continue to open stores. As we said in the comment, we'll open 100 stores this year.  \n And at this point, don't see any changes in our expansion plans. But I would say overall on the renewals and the new rents, there's nothing that I'd call out specifically. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. Very helpful. Best of luck. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Did you or could you, I guess, qualify like-for-like AUR versus maybe the mix shifts-driven AUR? Just trying to align the AUR with the markdown color. And then sorry for what's probably a dumb question, but just can you help parse out the comment, that earnings beat, because of the lower incentive cost on the lower sales?\n I guess -- just trying to understand what it means that you made more money on the bottom line because sales missed plan and how to think about maybe what levers you have at your disposal if top line pressures get worse. \nMichael Hartshorn: On the comment on incentive costs, it was a function of lower earnings. If we would have been at this comp level, we would have been fairly close to the low end of the earnings range. \n In terms of cost structure, certainly, there are other things we can do in the cost structure if we saw a greater decline in sales. They probably wouldn't be great decisions for the long term or going into 2023, but we could certainly get more stark with our expense structure. \nBarbara Rentler: And could you just repeat the first question about the AUR markdowns? Could you just say that again? \nSimeon Siegel: Yes, sure. So just within AUR, I guess, any way to think through like-for-like is tough given your product offering. But just if AUR -- how much may have been driven by mix shift versus like-for-like? \nBarbara Rentler: Part of it was driven by mix shift because there were businesses that we didn't maximize last year because of supply lines or, for example, things like shoes, which runs a higher AUR. So part of it comes from mix, where we couldn't get the supply we needed last year fast enough to drive the sales higher.  \n But the other part of it just comes from -- strategically, we strategically increased some prices where we have other, potentially, assortment shifts within the mix. And so it's kind of hard to really quantify that in saying because we're comparing casual product to wear-to-work product now. Wear-to-work product has higher AURs than active wear. So I would -- all I could tell you really is it's a mix. It's really a mix of both.  \n Certainly, apparel raises the AUR compared to casual. And definitely, shoes helped to raise the AUR because it's just a different product base, and we couldn't get the supply we needed last year. So those would be my 2 main call-outs on that. \nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Can you just give a quick update? Are there any changes on the store openings for this year? And then, Barbara, I have a bigger picture question just about the use of packaways in back-to-school. As kids are going back to school, do you think you are well set up in uniform and what they need for back-to-school?\n And are you seeing a difference in the way she's shopping? Meaning is she buying what she needs and holding off on what she wants? Maybe the new fashion top, but her kids are getting her back-to-school clothing. \nMichael Hartshorn: Marni, on real estate, no change. We expect to open 100 locations, and that's 41 stores over the balance of the year. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of back-to-school, I would -- she bought -- she's buying definitely the necessities. She is buying uniforms and backpacks and all of those products. I also think that part of what she bought for back-to-school was she might have bought her child shorts when people started taking markdowns on, let's say, denim shorts earlier.  \n So I think it's kind of a mixed bag. But I think if we were historically talking about back-to-school over time, the customer has bought merchandise much closer to the time they go to school or immediately after they get in school. It's hard to tell now with the pandemic, right? So that would also [indiscernible] and so I think it's a combination of both. But it's been very hard to read without having 2 or 3 years of any real history on it. So... \nMarni Shapiro: Right. I guess that makes sense. It feels like it's going to be a later back-to-school this year anyway with pressure on her. And so it feels like she's buying what she needs, and everything else could kind of take a pause. And so maybe there's a break in weather or whatever it is. \n And then just one last. On holiday traffic, last year, you had -- your inventories were clean. But also, we had Omicron hit at some point in December. And so it feels like there's a real opportunity even in just driving traffic to the stores for gifting and -- during that period of time, assuming there's not some, I don't know, new variant, the gamma 5 variant or whatever it is. \nMichael Hartshorn: You're right, Marni. Last year, we were impacted, especially approaching Christmas with Omicron. And then within our own performance, we had difficulty getting good  holiday goods through the supply chain. \nMarni Shapiro: Okay. I just wanted to confirm. Great. Best of luck, guys, with the rest of back-to-school and fall. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2022 performance, followed by our updated outlook for the second half and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our sales results, which were impacted by the mounting inflationary pressures our customers faced as well as an increasingly promotional retail environment. Earnings came in above our guidance range, primarily due to lower incentive costs resulting from the below-plan top line performance. \n Total sales for the period were $4.6 billion versus $4.8 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales were down 7% compared to a robust 15% increase in last year's second quarter, which was our strongest period of 2021. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022, were $1.11 on net income of $385 million. These results compared to $1.39 per share on net earnings of $494 million for last year's second quarter. \n For the first 6 months, earnings per share were $2.08 on net income of $723 million. These results compared to earnings per share of $2.73 on net earnings of $971 million in the first half of 2021. \n Sales for the 2022 year-to-date period were $8.9 billion with comparable sales down 7% versus a strong 14% gain in the first half of 2021. Shoes and men's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter. Both Florida and Texas were the top-performing regions, mainly due to the outperformance of our border and tourist locations. We are making merchandising adjustments to meet changing customer demand. That said, the actions we have taken thus far were unable to offset the mounting financial pressures on our low- to moderate-income consumers and the impact on our business from an increasingly promotional retail environment. \n Similar to the first quarter, dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the second quarter continued to be well below Ross's, mainly due to today's escalating inflationary pressures that are having a larger impact on dd's lower-income customers. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 55% versus the same period in 2021. While average store inventory during the quarter were up 15% versus last year, we operated with very similar levels when compared to pre-pandemic. \n Packaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventory versus 30% in the same period of the prior year when we used a substantial amount of packaways to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion continued to ease during the second quarter, resulting in above-plan early receipts of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores throughout the fall season.  Looking ahead, we expect these early receipts to wane and to have the appropriate inventory levels in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 21 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. Now Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Thank you, Adam. We are facing a very difficult and uncertain macroeconomic environment that we expect will continue to strain our customers' discretionary spending. Though 2022 will likely remain a challenging year for our company, we believe our value-focused business model and our strong financial position will enable us to manage through these economic pressures and rebound over time. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. So Lorraine, in terms of opportunities in terms of the fourth quarter, I think that would be around gifting -- that we didn't maximize some of our gifting areas last year. Home sales are relatively in line with the chain average and the performance of home and apparel was pretty similar for the quarter. Both businesses had areas of business that were strong and areas of business that were weaker, so they were relatively in line. Sure. The pivot was to take us out of casual product into more things that the customer wanted. So more wear-to-work in men's and ladies, more social, more going out-type products, whether that would have been in shoes or ready-to-wear.  \n That's really where the main shift was on the apparel side. We've made some progress there, but we certainly have a longer way to go. But I feel much better about where we were -- from where we were in Q1 to where we are now because we've really been able to expand some of those assortments when I felt like we were a little bit behind.  \n So -- and then in terms of go forward, we're going to meet whatever the customer demand is. So with everything that is so difficult out there, a highly promotional environment, we're going to see where the customer tells us, where and when what she wants, and then we'll make the shift from there. But we feel like we're in a better state of balance between, let's say, casual and more wear-to-work products in men's and ladies. The answer to that is yes. Both new vendors or vendors that perhaps, we hadn't seen availability from for an extended period of time, the availability out there is pretty broad-based right now in all products and a good -- better basket. There's just a lot of merchandise in the country.  \n And so I think vendors themselves are looking to expand their business. And if they haven't been doing business with us, at least it was an opportunity. So yes, I think that -- and I think that probably will continue based on the amount of inventory that's in the country. Okay. Just first, in terms of the deals, it was a good deal today just to get better as we go. The merchants are really out there in the market shopping to see what's out there, shopping to see what the availability is. And to assess where the product is the best product is [ going to happen ]. There is a lot of product out there. What you really want to do is get the best product at the best price, so the merchants are out there assessing what that looks like. And then you really want to get the most desirable product, right?  \n So if it's the best product and you think that's a really sharp price and something you haven't been able to really get or [ deploy ], you're going to pull the trigger and buy it. If there's a lot of -- if there's products where there's lots and lots of availability, you might buy some metered in, you might pack some away for the following year.  \n I mean, it's not just one kind of cookie-cutter answer here. I think that the key thing now for the merchants is really to be out there understanding the promotional environment, right? So when you're buying goods now, what you really have to be attuned to is what is the right value.  \n So the buyers have to be very strategic in terms of buying the right merchandise at the appropriate value for customers, given the current inflationary environment. So I think it's supply, and it's really studying what's going on in the outside world with so much inventory sitting in retail stores, with the inflated inventory and a more promotional environment, which I think we all believe is probably going to get more heightened in the fourth quarter.  \n So there's a variety of things that need to happen there, so I don't think it's quite the cookie-cutter. So to get to, I think we'll see some for this year. I think there'll be some packaway for spring, and there may even potentially be some packaway for fall. But we have to wait and see what that looks like. So Matthew, in terms of mounting inflation, I think over the last few months, we had initially made strategic price increases. And I think with the slowing consumer demand and the escalating inflationary pressures, it all comes down to value. And so for us to be successful, we really need to make sure that we understand the value of what's going on around us and get ourselves really highly focused on that because that really, in the end, is what will make us successful.  \n Our customer is looking for branded bargains, great values every day. That's what she's come to expect for 40 years, and that's what she expects from us now. So I think that really comes down to the merchants being in the market, understanding the availability, understanding what's going on and then knowing when to pull the trigger and to drive it because that's what helped us from 2008 to 2009. \n And I think that, that will help -- what will help us here also in getting ourselves in the right value when the customer is under so much pressure with all the macroeconomic issues that are out there. Adrienne, as it pertains to Walmart, look, I think we look at everyone as a competitor, whether it's Walmart, whether it's the other off-pricers, whether it's Macy's. I think there's a lot of opportunities for the consumer to buy bargains now and whether it's Walmart or Target, whoever it is, and so it's hard for us to measure that.  \n I think the most important thing that we can do now is really, we need to understand value. And we need to understand where we need to be on the value equation with the customer. And that is a shift from where we were. So I think it's very -- it's hard for us to measure that.  \n But again, it's more competition. And they have both been very aggressive in their pricing, as we all know, to move through some goods. So that's our job to understand it. But we do serve a wide range of customers. Today, we serve a wide range of customers. So we're going to watch trends closely and then we'll make merchandising adjustments accordingly. So it would probably take us some time to see because our range of customers is so broad. Right. And also, based off the supply lines in the world, if, in fact, the trends line turns out to be better than we think it is, we're going to be able to chase some of that. In terms of margins on closeouts and upfront, it's hard to compare 1 year to another based on -- it's hard to compare what I bought this year versus what I had historically, so it's not necessarily quite as simple as just as going, here's the pitch on it.\n So I think it remains to be seen on the closeout rates. We've seen what kind of values we need to put on the floor and what availability, when people want to move it. It's a measured balance. Yes. Listen, we're in the value business. And in the last couple of quarters, we've really -- we've made some strategic price increases. And the customer, based on slowing demand and inflationary pressures, has voted that she doesn't necessarily think the value is where it needs to be.  \n So yes, if we could get -- we want to get our AUR more in line, and we want to offer the customer more value. And the AUR can move around based off of mix, right, because it doesn't necessarily mean depending upon what types of products you have on the floor, the AUR can move.  \n I think the word we're looking here is for value. And clearly, the more value we offer the customer, history would tell us that we would perform better. So that is our strategy. I mean based off of where she is and the pressure that the customer is under, that's really what we need to do. We need to understand what the outside world is doing and we need to offer better value. And then in terms of the inventory level coming down, we see that moving as it goes throughout the fall. But with that, we have liquidity, and we're comfortable with our liquidity. And so we have -- open to buy to take advantage of opportunities. So it's kind of 2 things going on at the same time. I think it's a combination of both. But I think the promotional environment has gotten so aggressive in such a short period of time that we need to make the move on the goods. Otherwise, we're not offering the customer the value that she wants and needs, and so that's played a big part of it.  \n And then there's always -- there always is. There's always businesses that aren't good or they need to take markdowns more aggressively. But that's really -- it's the promotional cadence and just really watching where the AUR is in the outside world and being very, very conscious of that and understanding that.  So getting -- the faster we get to the value equation that she really wants, the better our performance will be. And could you just repeat the first question about the AUR markdowns? Could you just say that again? Part of it was driven by mix shift because there were businesses that we didn't maximize last year because of supply lines or, for example, things like shoes, which runs a higher AUR. So part of it comes from mix, where we couldn't get the supply we needed last year fast enough to drive the sales higher.  \n But the other part of it just comes from -- strategically, we strategically increased some prices where we have other, potentially, assortment shifts within the mix. And so it's kind of hard to really quantify that in saying because we're comparing casual product to wear-to-work product now. Wear-to-work product has higher AURs than active wear. So I would -- all I could tell you really is it's a mix. It's really a mix of both.  \n Certainly, apparel raises the AUR compared to casual. And definitely, shoes helped to raise the AUR because it's just a different product base, and we couldn't get the supply we needed last year. So those would be my 2 main call-outs on that. And in terms of back-to-school, I would -- she bought -- she's buying definitely the necessities. She is buying uniforms and backpacks and all of those products.

It's hard to tell now with the pandemic, right? So that would also [indiscernible] and so I think it's a combination of both. But it's been very hard to read without having 2 or 3 years of any real history on it. So... Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as a decline in the number of transactions versus the prior year was partially offset by an increase in the size of the average basket. Second quarter operating margin was 11.3% compared to 14.1% in 2021. This decline was due to a combination of deleveraging effect on expenses from the decrease in same-store sales, higher markdowns and ongoing headwinds from higher freight costs that did not begin to escalate until the second half of 2021. \n These expense pressures were partially offset by lower incentive costs that were much higher last year when we significantly outperformed our plans. We also saw a decline in COVID expenses versus last year's second quarter. Cost of goods sold during the period increased by 320 basis points. Merchandise margin declined 205 basis points due to both higher ocean freight costs and markdowns. Distribution costs increased 85 basis points due to a combination of unfavorable timing of packaway-related expenses and deleverage from our new distribution center, while occupancy and domestic freight rose by 55 and 35 basis points, respectively. \n Partially offsetting these higher costs were buying expenses that improved by 60 basis points, again due to lower incentives. SG&A for the period levered by 40 basis points as deleverage from the lower comparable sales was more than offset by lower incentive and COVID costs. \n During the second quarter, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $235 million. As previously announced, we expect to buy back $950 million of common stock during fiscal 2022 under our 2-year $1.9 billion repurchase program that extends through fiscal 2023. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our recent results as well as the increasingly unpredictable macroeconomic landscape in today's more promotional retail environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending October 29, 2022, to decline 7% to 9% on top of a strong 14% gain last year. \n For the fourth quarter, same-store sales are planned to be down 4% to 7% versus a 9% increase in the last quarter of 2021. As noted in our press release, if the second half performs in line with these updated sales assumptions, earnings per share for the third quarter is projected to be $0.72 to $0.83 versus $1.09 last year and $1.04 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.04 in 2021. Based on our first half results and second half guidance, earnings per share for fiscal 2022 are now planned to be in the range of $3.84 to $4.12 versus $4.87 last year. \n Now let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2022. Total sales are forecasted to decline 4% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 41 locations during the quarter, including 29 Ross and 12 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the third quarter is planned to be in the 7.8% to 8.7% range versus 11.4% in 2021, primarily reflecting the deleverage on the same-store sales decline. In addition, merchandise margin is forecast to be pressured by ongoing increases in ocean freight costs. We are also projecting higher markdowns to right-size our inventory levels given the lower revenue forecast and adjust pricing as we expect an increasingly promotional retail environment. \n Lastly, third quarter operating margin also reflects unfavorable timing of packaway-related costs. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $400,000. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 345 million. \n Finally, I want to emphasize that Ross continues to be in a strong financial position with significant resources to manage through today's challenging economic and retail landscape. Our healthy balance sheet includes $5.2 billion in total liquidity with $3.9 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in untapped borrowing capacity. We also continue to return large amounts of cash to stockholders with a cumulative total of $1.4 billion expected to be paid out under our stock repurchase and dividend programs in 2022. Now I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments. And Matthew, this is Adam. So we don't see anything structurally different in our model, still feel bullish about the environment, the retail environment in our model going forward. When we talk about multiyear and think about 2023, specifically, I think the key is we're going to have to see how the inflationary aspects play out in the second half.  That's obviously a critical variable. How we plan sales next year, profitability will be highly dependent on that kind of top line assumption. And Mark, this is Adam. Just to build on that, I think when you look at timing in third quarter versus fourth quarter, ocean freight probably is still headwinds as we move into third quarter just based on the comparison to LY and then probably some favorability, specifically in ocean freight in fourth quarter, and then probably a little bit more timing impact from our packaway cost in third quarter versus fourth quarter."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "It's Michael Hartshorn. First, on the fourth quarter guidance alone, if you look at the multiyear compare, we did a 9% last year. So it's one of the easiest compares, which is really the driver of the 4% to 7% comp this year in guidance. Paul, on the macro, I mean, of course, there are things that we know we could have done better in the business. In terms of trends during the quarter, we outperformed earlier in the quarter, both on a single-year and a multiyear basis.  \n And I think if you looked across retail, I think people weakened in the back half of the quarter. Obviously, fuel prices peaked in June so a portion of the performance is certainly driven by the macroeconomic environment. Yes. We wouldn't comment on trends within this next quarter. Matthew, just to add to that, obviously, since the pre-pandemic, the changes have been really around the cost in the business, and those are acutely in 2 different places with wages and transportation, whether domestically or on imports. I think what we expect to see is both the domestic and import costs to come down over time.  \n We're already starting to see some break in those costs here in the back half, especially on the import costs. So I think those will come down, which will be a benefit to us. On the wage front, I think the increases we saw during COVID are structural at the current levels and are at least at this level.  \n What I'd say about the wage market right now is it's still tight, but it is stable, which is much different from where we were last year when we were getting people back to work and there was frenzied demand in the U.S.  \n So I think there is going to be some opportunity in cost as the transportation comes down with the lower demand in the U.S. On pricing, what we saw during the quarter on AUR, so AURs were up during the quarter. As we said in the commentary, the minus 7% comp was a function of lower traffic and higher basket. The basket was really driven by a higher AUR.  \n What we'd expect for the fall season with us really trying to drive value and with our additional markdowns, we'd expect AURs to moderate versus the first half over the balance of the year. Just on Q4, as I mentioned in Lorraine's question, that was our lowest comp last year, and that was a function of, one, with supply chain congestion, we didn't get all the goods we wanted to in the stores before the holiday, and there was also an Omicron spike leading up to Christmas that dampened traffic a bit.  So that should be a benefit versus last year. \n And then the fourth quarter was the peak of our cost increases, including incentives, and cost in the business, whether it was ocean freight or wage increases to staff in the store and the DCs for holiday. So we're up against that, and that will be a benefit versus last year. On the consumer, we're not seeing any change, certainly. Since -- if I take the first to the second quarter with our comps, they've been relatively consistent. The composition of comps have been relatively consistent. If I compare it to when we started to lap the stimulus from last year, and our customer surveys and our own performance would suggest that where we're really seeing pressure is the lower-end consumer.  But on the trade-down customer, there's no indication that is in our data that would suggest that that's happening. Michael, it's really a function -- it's our biggest quarter. It bodes -- serves us well to be very cautious, especially after missing 2 quarters in a row on top line, so we are being cautious in the fourth quarter. And we do think it's going to be a very promotional environment, so that's what it's based on. Ike, first, on the -- on what we have in packaway. We are up as a percentage of total inventory, but that is up against last year when we were using a lot of our packaway in the frenzied demand in the second quarter, which was our top comp for 2021.  \n And then also, packaway right now includes early receipts of merchandise, and that's mainly home product. And what happened there is that last year, we're experiencing longer lead times. We were having difficulty getting products on time and on plan. So what we did this year is extended our lead times coming into the first quarter in our ordering cycle.  \n What we saw in the first quarter is those -- surprisingly, lead times improved, but we kept the longer lead times in the second quarter because we were concerned about port labor negotiations in L.A. and also COVID -- continuing COVID shutdowns in China.  \n Neither of those risks played out and with lower demand in the U.S., lead times actually improved. So we have stored in packaway early receipts of home that will flow in the back half of the year. Dana on dd's, so similar to Q1, dd's performance in Q2 continued to be well below Ross, although up against very robust comps last year. The inflationary pressure here has even a larger impact on the dd's low-income customer.  \n dd's average household income is $40,000 to $45,000. Therefore, this customer is obviously more sensitive to the pressures in fuel and food costs and other inflationary purchases. I would say like Ross, our focus is on delivering the best bargains, but we need to even provide greater value to the dd's customer. And like Ross, we built in higher markdowns in the back half of the year. Laura, it's Mike. On logistics cost, we're already seeing them. They already seemed to have peaked and have started to come down. I think it's different between domestic and ocean freight. I think ocean freight, there are a lot of long-term contracts that it may take some time to come down. But certainly, the current noncontract market is below the contract rate. So we're starting to see some movement even on contract rates. \n Domestic, at least for us, we expect domestic costs to be relatively neutral in the back half because we started seeing them rising in the back half of last year. But I suspect over time, both of them will come down and maybe not to the levels that we saw pre-pandemic though. I would say from an expense structure standpoint, we absolutely have put in places, whether using technology in the stores or automation in our distribution centers, which is our big pockets of expense, we've continued to add new capabilities in stores and in the distribution centers to increase efficiency and reduce costs. I wouldn't say there's anything material in that renewal process, but we will continue to open stores. As we said in the comment, we'll open 100 stores this year.  \n And at this point, don't see any changes in our expansion plans. But I would say overall on the renewals and the new rents, there's nothing that I'd call out specifically. On the comment on incentive costs, it was a function of lower earnings. If we would have been at this comp level, we would have been fairly close to the low end of the earnings range. \n In terms of cost structure, certainly, there are other things we can do in the cost structure if we saw a greater decline in sales. They probably wouldn't be great decisions for the long term or going into 2023, but we could certainly get more stark with our expense structure. Marni, on real estate, no change. We expect to open 100 locations, and that's 41 stores over the balance of the year. You're right, Marni. Last year, we were impacted, especially approaching Christmas with Omicron. And then within our own performance, we had difficulty getting good  holiday goods through the supply chain."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores First Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.  \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2021 Form 10-K and fiscal 2022 8-Ks on file with the SEC.  \n Now I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, ma'am. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.  \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our lower-than-expected first quarter results. We knew 2022 would be a difficult year to predict, especially the first half when we were facing last year's record levels of government stimulus and significant customer pent-up demand as COVID restrictions eased. The external environment has also proven extremely challenging as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated inflationary pressures on the consumer not seen in 40 years. As a result of these factors, our first quarter results underperformed our expectations.  \n Total sales for the first quarter were $4.3 billion with comparable store sales down 7% on top of a robust 13% gain in the first quarter of 2021 that were versus 2019. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022, were $0.97 on net income of $338 million.  \n The quarter includes an approximate benefit of $0.06 per share from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. These results compared to $1.34 per share on net earnings of $476 million for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021.  \n Men's was the strongest merchandise area during the quarter, while Florida was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter trailed that of Ross, as the significant benefit of last year's stimulus and escalating inflationary pressures had a larger impact on lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 57% versus the same period in 2021, mainly from higher packaway inventory.  \n Packaway merchandise represented 43% of total inventories versus 34% last year when we used a substantial amount of packaway to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion eased somewhat during the first quarter, resulting in the early receipt of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores later in the year. Average store inventories during the quarter were up, though we still operated with significantly less inventory in store than we did pre-pandemic.  \n Turning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores.  \n Now Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as average basket growth was more than offset by the decline in transactions versus the prior year. First quarter operating margin of 10.8% was down from 14.2% in 2021, mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the same-store sales decline, along with ongoing cost pressures from higher freight and wages that began to escalate in the second half of 2021.  \n As Barbara commented earlier, the quarter benefited from the favorable timing of expenses, most of which were in gross margin. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter increased by 295 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin declined 170 basis points, primarily due to higher ocean freight costs. Domestic freight rose 80 basis points while occupancy delevered 40 basis points on the same-store sales decline. Distribution costs increased 25 basis points, mainly due to wage actions taken last year. These unfavorable items were partially offset by buying expenses that improved by 20 basis points. SG&A for the period rose 50 basis points due to higher wages and the deleveraging effect of lower comparable sales. \n During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $240 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.  \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our first quarter results and today's increasingly uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2022, to decrease 4% to 6% on top of a very strong 15% gain in the prior year period. Second quarter earnings per share are projected to be $0.99 to $1.07 versus $1.39 last year.  \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2022 include the following: Total sales are forecast to decline 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 29 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 10.4% to 10.8% range, down from 2021 due to deleverage on lower same-store sales and ongoing expense headwinds that are expected to continue through the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 348 million.  \n For the full year, we are now planning comparable store sales to decline 2% to 4% and earnings per share in the range of $4.34 to $4.58. As Barbara mentioned, this reflects our continued expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the balance of the year.  \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. Looking ahead, while the landscape in early 2022 has been tougher than expected and the year may prove to be more difficult than initially anticipated, we remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate through this period. We have shown in the past that our value-focused business model has served us well in both healthy and more uncertain external climates and believe the current challenging conditions will be no different. Despite the slower-than-expected start to 2022, we operate in an attractive sector of retailing. Our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. As demonstrated by our long successful track record, we believe our steadfast focus on the execution of this core strategy will be the key driver of our success.  \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. \nKimberly Greenberger: Barbara, I wanted to ask about product and merchandise execution. Could you just comment on how you feel the team is executing in merchandising? And how did merchandise margin perform here in the quarter, if you exclude, let's say, inbound freight and domestic transportation costs? Are there any pockets of inventory where you wish you had a little bit more and how in aggregate are you feeling about your overall inventory position? \nAdam Orvos: And Barbara, this is Adam. I can jump in on the merchandise margin question, and then throw it back to you.  So Kimberly merchandise margin, as stated in the comments, has dropped 170 basis points versus last year. But we would have been flat versus last year's significant gain without the impact of ocean freight. \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of -- let's start with the pockets of inventory in aggregate. At this stage, Kimberly, in the market, there's a lot of availability. And it's very broad based, whether it's in home or whether it's in apparel, there's a lot of supply out there. So I wouldn't really say that there are problems in any pockets of inventory that we have.  \n In terms of execution in products -- in merchandise, here's what I would say. I would say that we didn't execute at the level that we're capable of. We're digging into the business now and we feel that we can improve the assortments and we can improve our execution. So at this point, it's really about us. It's about us taking different actions in some of our assortments overall, I would say. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Obviously, a very tough environment out there, especially for lower-income consumers. We've heard from other retailers that the initial shock of inflation following Russia and Ukraine led to a pause. Curious if you've seen any notable change in trend, a positive change in trend as you move through April and into May.\n And then bigger picture, Ross has navigated weaker economic environments in the past, benefited from the trade down to value. Just how do you view the potential for that as the year unfolds? \nMichael Hartshorn: Mark,  it's Michael Hartshorn. On our trend during the quarter, ours was, we -- following a fairly strong start to the period -- the start to the quarter, for us, sales underperformed over the balance of the quarter. And I think, most importantly, there was us anniversarying the government stimulus and customer pent-up demand last year. We also didn't see a pickup during Easter that we had planned into the business. And we wouldn't comment on inter-quarter trends at this point.  \n On the trade-down customer, it's hard to say. Obviously, with higher fuel and food prices, discretionary spending for the lower-end customer is being squeezed. We saw customers at both chains pull back on spending in the first quarter.  \n In terms of trade down, the best proxy we would have, although every recession is different, would be 2008, when the fall of 2008 was very difficult and we started to see some improvement in the first half of 2009. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: I wanted to follow up on your comment, Barbara, that sales and profitability -- within your guidance, sales and profitability will improve as the year progresses. Can you just provide us with just some context on what gets you comfortable, especially on the top line, that things will improve as the year goes on? \nMichael Hartshorn: Lorraine, on the top line, the guidance assumes a fairly steady pace. In the fourth quarter, we know -- for instance, we have opportunity because we're up against Omicron, and we had supply chain congestion that we know we lost business in the fourth quarter last year.  \n In terms of profitability, as we said, when we started the year, we do have -- we did make wage increases in the back half of 2021. And we also -- that is also where we started to see the freight increases. So the guidance assumes that we lap those increases from last year.  \n Overall, what you see in our changed guidance is really just sales. We haven't changed our expense assumptions. When we came into the year, we thought we had a good grasp on freight, ocean freight, wages. And the only thing that's slightly changed there is fuel, but we've been able to offset those in other costs in the business. So the updated guidance really is a sales flow-through. \nBarbara Rentler: And Lorraine, in terms of the assortment, what happened last year is that merchandise slid, as I'm sure it did for all retailers. Different product categories created real gaps in the assortment. So as you get into fall and the inventories catch up with where those gaps were gives you the confidence in certain businesses that the performance should be better. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Barbara, on the magnitude of the comp slowdown as the quarter progressed, I guess, were there any notable changes by category or specific geographical call-outs as you dissect the first quarter? And then just looking back, if we take maybe a broader picture thought process, are there any time frames that you'd compare the magnitude of this sharp slowdown? How many quarters or how long did it take for your model to respond? Just kind of thinking about the duration in the past, and then the subsequent improvement that you're baking in as the year progresses? \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of a slowdown, Michael, from one quarter to another, I can't really think of a period of time were we baked in that other than in 2016, where we had difficulty in the ladies business, where we had a slowdown... \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I mean, Matthew, we knew there was going to be a slowdown, at least on a comp level with all the government stimulus that came out last year. So we had actually planned that in the business and also with the customer pent-up demand as COVID restrictions ease. \n So even in our initial guidance, the low end of the range was a minus 4, so we missed that by about 3 points. In terms of where in the business has slowed down, it was pretty broad-based. We did see pockets of opportunity. If you look at our larger markets, Texas and Florida outperformed. We had expected, as the border opened up, that we'd see improvement there. We, in fact, did in Florida as tourism and travel started to increase. We had planned increases there, and we saw improvement. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of the assortment, apparel outperformed home. We were up against very large comps in home in Q1. And so that's really where we saw a large difference in performance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. \nMichael Binetti: So I guess as we look at the quarter on paper, this is -- it looks pretty far from where we were on the narrative in early April. I think there's been a pretty consistent narrative that you felt good on inventory. And I think you felt like it came into spring with the right mix of goods for the categories. The consumer is clearly drawing the line between wanting back-office apparel dresses for women, those kinds of things. So it does sound like demand was the issue. \n I think you did, however, talk about, in the initial guidance, an acceleration through the year. And I think at the time, one of the inputs was, by 2Q last year, once stimulus kind of cleaned out some of the inventory, you were in chase mode on some real meat and potatoes items that were just stocked out. And I think that fueled a lot of your optimism baked into the acceleration through the year. \n So it seems like the demand line has changed quite a bit here and that just having inventory may not be sufficient at this point. But how do you true that up and bring that forward and say, \"Look, we were missing some categories a year ago in 2Q versus the expectation for sales to continue to be very, very slow here in the second quarter?\" \nMichael Hartshorn: Michael, I would just say overall, I mean, it serves us well to be given our underperformance in Q1 to be cautious with the rest of the year. And that's why you saw us bring down the guidance. And that's true from buying inventory to running the company with lower expenses. So we'll see how it plays out. I mean it's very uncertain out there. The inflationary environment was much more than we expected when we entered the year, and we're going to put ourselves in a position to chase business and to chase trends, and we think that will allow us to maximize our potential in this environment. \nBarbara Rentler: And as we dig into the opportunities of the businesses that we did miss and that we didn't have last year, that would be part of what we're looking at to improve the business. So making the shift in your example into more dress versus casual and making the appropriate move. So we're digging into that piece now. \nMichael Binetti: Okay. And can I -- if I could follow that. Is it safe to say the AUR strategy you might have rolled it back a little bit given some of the commentary we've heard across the space at this point? And it sounds like a sharper focus on value versus what you were thinking from the consumer. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. The AUR strategy, we strategically increased prices. So we didn't do it just straight across the board. So what we really did was make sure that there was appropriate price separation from traditional retailers. And so we monitor that very, very closely. \n And so the merchants can see on the term line every single week whether something is working or not. And so that piece will continue to do in both companies really with a high focus on value, right? So that a slightly higher AUR might be a very strong value based on what's going on in the rest of the world. So I think the value equation, to your point, is really what our customer looks for and comes to expect from us. And so we are highly focused on the value equation. But that doesn't mean that potentially an AUR could be higher. So they're not mutually exclusive. It could be both ways. You really have to know where and what. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: It seems like the buying environment is about to turn from just okay to potentially extremely good given where retail inventory levels are going to exit the first quarter, particularly in home. So I'm curious how quickly the merchant buying teams can take advantage of this? And have you baked any of that into the guide for 2Q and beyond? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, the merchants can take advantage of the closeout opportunities as they become available. And there are closeouts in home, and that's more unusual than it is in apparel. Supply lines right now are very broad-based based of all the things that you know. Goods coming in early. People bringing in fall early. So it's kind of all collided at the same time into the marketplace. But the merchants can take advantage of that as quickly as possible, if it's the right merchandise and right product. So there's nothing in their way to keep them from doing that. \nMichael Hartshorn: And we -- on your question on the guidance, we have not built any upside on that into our guidance. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Just 2 quick ones. Just on the merchandise margin in the quarter, so 170 was fully ocean freight. Can you -- based on the contracts and the visibility you have, what should that headwind kind of look like big picture or specific as you guys can get as we move into Q2 and beyond? \n And then to Michael's question on AUR, can you kind of help us with the inventory? I mean it looks heavy, but it's hard to kind of read between the lines sometimes. Are you guys comfortable with your inventory position? Do you see a need to maybe need to clear more product in Q2? Just kind of trying to make -- trying to understand where exactly your comfort is on the inventory right now? \nMichael Hartshorn: I'll start with the -- your last question first on inventory there. So overall, the growth in inventories was really packaway. We ended with 43% of the total inventories versus 34% last year. And if you can remember from last year, we used a substantial amount of that packaway to backstop the demand we saw at the end of the first quarter when the stimulus came out. So the 34% was lower than our historical levels. \n The second piece relates to supply chain congestion. When we came into the year, we planned longer lead times based on what we saw in the fourth quarter. So what that meant for us, for businesses where we directly import mainly in home, what happened in Q1 is the supply chain eased somewhat and we received early second quarter goods in home, and we stored them in packaway and will flow them later in the year. \n As far as in-store inventories, we operated up from last year, but remember, again, they were lower than we had anticipated with the frenzied demand, but well below pre-pandemic levels. And so I would say, overall, we're happy with our overall inventory levels. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. And touching on the ocean freight question, they will remain elevated throughout the balance of 2022. But as we anniversary that spike that we had in the second half last year, they remain elevated but improved through the balance of the year. \n And on the domestic freight side, as Michael commented, fuel costs are higher than our expectations at the beginning of the year, but we've offset that in the guidance that we've provided to you. And by the second half, we don't really -- we don't see any pressure on domestic freight. \nBarbara Rentler: In terms of packaway, we're very comfortable with the content of packaway also. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: A few quick ones, if possible. Do you know inventory growth in units versus dollars? And then what percent of the freight costs generally are ocean versus domestic? \nMichael Hartshorn: We wouldn't give you the unit growth. That's not something we disclose. \nSimeon Siegel: Okay. And freight costs, just ocean versus domestic in general? \nMichael Hartshorn: Can you repeat the question? \nSimeon Siegel: When you think about your total freight costs, just roughly what is the ocean versus domestic breakdown? So what percentage of your freight costs tend to be ocean versus domestic? \nMichael Hartshorn: We don't disclose that externally. \nSimeon Siegel: Okay. All right. I'll try one last one then. I think you talked about deleverage. What do you -- can you -- what do you expect for SG&A dollar growth to look like for the year, built into that or embedded in the comments you gave? \nMichael Hartshorn: Could you repeat that question? \nSimeon Siegel: Embedded -- yes, sure. So embedded in the full year guide, just how are you thinking about SG&A dollar growth? \nMichael Hartshorn: I don't know. Can we -- why don't we call you after the call and get specific modeling questions for you? \nSimeon Siegel: Sounds good. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I wanted to dig into the comment on kind of redirecting or reallocating some of the penetration. What is or was home penetration during the quarter maybe versus ladies apparel? Because I'm assuming that, that apparel piece was the stronger piece of it. And then secondly, how are store traffic trends over the -- pacing over the quarter? If you can help us with those 2, that would be great. \nMichael Hartshorn: In terms of overall home apparel, I think Barbara mentioned earlier that apparel outperformed home, although home was up against very strong comps last year. Adrienne, we also talked a little bit about the trend, and that was similar for traffic in that we had a strong start to the year, so year-over-year growth. And then that dropped in later in the quarter as we started to anniversary the stimulus and also customer pent-up demand. \nBarbara Rentler: And home penetration is around 25% of the company's... \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Similar to pre-pandemic, in that range. And then I guess on packaway, so there's a portion of the packaway -- so the number, I think, if I got it correctly, was 43% at the end of this quarter. Some of that is obviously the early receipts in home goods. Were you able to take advantage of any of the unfavorable kind of transition to spring? \n And I know you don't have a large exposure to the Northeast, but picking up some of those goods off of Northeast retailers. We've seen this happen in the past for you, where that short really does work to your benefit as you redeploy it in 2Q? Is that an opportunity? \nBarbara Rentler: I think that doesn't just come from Northeast retailers. I think there's a lot of spring goods that came into the country and spring -- last fall, plus early spring kind of all collided and came into the country pretty much at the same time. So part of it, I'm sure, comes from Northeast retailers. And part of it just comes in from the supply that came into the country as the congestion eased all at the same time. And we've been able to buy appropriately the things we want in spring products. So yes, there will be spring products that we can use from Q1 into Q2. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: One clarification. I think someone on the call mentioned you did not see the lift around Easter that you normally do. And I was curious if that was related to traffic or assortment? I'm just trying to think it through to other holidays that are coming up and the more traditional cadence of retail business getting back to where it was. \n And then if you could just talk a little bit about any excess you have going into the second quarter? Will it be liquidated in the second quarter? Or is it current enough that it doesn't have to be marked down? And is this contemplated in the operating margin guidance? \nMichael Hartshorn: Marni, on the inventory, we actually ended with store inventory where we wanted them. So there isn't any liquidation past the first quarter. \n And then on Easter -- I commented earlier on Easter, and that was versus our expectations. Typically, when there's a later Easter, you have less weather. So we missed our own expectations there in our plan. \nMarni Shapiro: Well, I'm just curious, do you think -- was that -- because overall traffic was lower? Or was it the assortments? Do you think it was more specific to just traffic in general and the late Easter or the assortments that you had in place for Easter? \nBarbara Rentler: What you would define as the Easter assortments, Marni, dresses, dress shoes, children's dresses, those just were fine. \nMarni Shapiro: So that was fine. So you had the lift for that, but the overall traffic lift, as people kind of have a little bit of time off or holidays coming up, that you didn't see? \nMichael Hartshorn: I would say, overall, the traffic is probably a large function of the consumer being squeezed with inflation. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: I have two, please. So I'm trying to square the model of your FY guide versus the Q2 guide, implies that you're modeling about flat comps in the second half of the year. And I'm trying to square that with your view of you're lapping assortment gaps last year, so you should be able to pick up more in the back half of the year. So how does that square with the view of flat comps? \n And then my next question is around packaway. So you picked up a lot of packaway in Q4. When does that start to flow through? Is that fall/winter assortment that we should start to see that margin benefit from that flowing through in the second half? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the back half, that it does include our easiest compare in the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter would be the stronger comp. On packaway, on average, packaway, we hold it for about 4 months. So that's the way you should think about the timing on when we typically flow goods. \nAneesha Sherman: But so just to follow up on the packaway. So if you -- the packaway that you're picking up in Q4, most of that will have already flowed through. Is that right? \nBarbara Rentler: It depends on the product. So the packaway that we picked up in Q4, so you're thinking it's like outerwear. So if it was outwear, it's seasonal. That packaway would obviously ship from the vendor when -- at the end of December, let's say, and would release in the fall season. But if you get -- there are other classifications of products like denim, like fleece, like knits or parts of home that are seasonless that can flow all along. So that can flow in Q1, can flow in Q2. A lot of packaway products are seasonless. So depending on the product itself. \nOperator: Your next comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory. \nDana Telsey: Last quarter, we had talked about taking price. Where are we in that journey given the slowdown? Is that being adjusted at all? What are you seeing? And how does it differ for dd's versus the Ross brand? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So as we've talked about before, we started to increase some of our AURs. Keeping in mind that it has to be the appropriate value separation from traditional retailers and in both companies. And we're strategically doing it. It's not just straight across the board and obviously examining that very closely, does it make sense or not. And you can do that simply by how quickly the goods turn and the markdown rate. \n So the merchants are managing that every week while they're going through their selling. And then we're reviewing it, obviously, at a higher level to make sure that, that hasn't been an issue. But in both companies and particularly in dd's where the customer is very price sensitive, we really look at that at a pretty low level. \nDana Telsey: Got it. And then just the health of your consumer, what are you seeing there? And how do you define the household income of dd's and Ross customers? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the -- first of all, our overall customer is very broad, age-wise, ethnicity, and income-wise. On average, the Ross customer makes between 60 -- household income, $60,000 to $65,000. And the dd's customer is south of that, in the $40,000, $45,000 range. But I would say the health of our customer, they're being squeezed. Food and fuel prices with inflation there means they have less to spend on discretionary items. \nDana Telsey: And then just lastly, as you think about the real estate portfolio, so then keep maintaining the same level of new store openings. Is there anything that would make you adjust your rate of new store openings? Or given that's a glide path for the future, no adjustment in the strong balance sheet that you have? How do you think of that real estate portfolio? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. At this point, Dana, we wouldn't change our glide path. We're planning to open 100 this year, and we will execute to that. And then we'll revisit our long-term plans. But we think there's market share available. We think there's market share opportunities. \n We think value will becoming increasingly important for the customer as it has over the last number of years. And we think we have a great opportunity ahead of us. So we would continue with our store opening plan. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: I'm wondering if weather had an impact on your comp this quarter. The strength of Florida would seem to point to that, but the comment that the comp decelerated as the quarter progressed sort of fights against that theory. \nMichael Hartshorn: Laura, the weather did not have a material impact on the business in the quarter. \nLaura Champine: How are your more mature markets, like some of the California markets holding up relative to the whole? \nMichael Hartshorn: California was relatively in line with the chain and then -- of our bigger markets, which you mentioned, Texas and Florida. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mauricio Serna with UBS. \nMauricio Serna Vega: I was wondering if you could comment on the divergence and performance between Ross stores and the dd's DISCOUNTS? Curious one on one began slowing down earlier than the other? \n And then maybe about a question on the second half. I'm looking into the numbers, it implies roughly second half of the year flat comp sales, but I think it also implies double-digit EPS growth. So I'm wondering like what are the puts and takes there to drive the EPS growth in the second half of the year? \nMichael Hartshorn: On dd's, dd's did trail Ross, but they were up against stronger gains last year, especially with the government stimulus that has an outsized impact on that consumer and also last year's stimulus, with -- at their income levels, they were also more impacted by inflation than the Ross customer. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. And later in the year, profitability improvement really on that flattish sales. We're going to go up against the anniversary of not only the wage side of it, but also domestic and ocean freight costs. So we'll anniversary those significant increases versus last year. So that's really providing the lift that you're seeing in the model. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: I believe in the prepared remarks, you talked about supply chain congestion easing somewhat. I was wondering if you could provide some incremental details about what you meant by that, what you witnessed in the quarter and then perhaps maybe what you're expecting going forward. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. We -- it's best to start from last year. So last year, the lead times degradated as we move through the year, so they got longer. So we planned the year based on what we saw in the fourth quarter. And what we saw in the first quarter is it did ease somewhat, which meant we received goods early. \n Expectations for going forward, I think, will be highly dependent on how China comes back from their shutdown. So we're watching that very closely. We're going to be very cautious with our lead times, but I think it's going to be dependent on whether when they open back up and the timing of when it opens back up, what type of congestion that causes. \nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Daniel Hofkin with William Blair. \nDaniel Hofkin: You may have addressed this earlier, so I apologize if this has already been asked. But when you talked about execution issues, is that strictly a matter of kind of not enough of -- better selling products, too much of slower selling product? Or are there other issues you would point to? And then second would be, how would you break down sales shortfall between execution and consumer slowing down? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes, I think what we're saying is we know we can do better. So in this environment -- inflationary environment, I mean, none of us have been in this for 40 years. So we know we can offer our customer better bargains, and we'll do that. So it's -- we wouldn't be able to break out execution versus the impact on inflation in the consumer. \nDaniel Hofkin: And then in terms of just the nature of the missed execution, was it all related to heaviness or how much of the better selling product you had are held or light on it or was it also pricing in some cases, just so we -- it would helpful understand that? \nBarbara Rentler: I think it goes back to what Michael was saying. It's not -- we had one major mistake or one major business that's really underperforming. We don't feel that we executed at the level that we're capable of. And so that might be something as simple as we should have bought more career versus casual, a shift of penetration of a few points, Filling up the delivery of something. It's just not quite as crisp as we normally are. There's no -- if the real question is, are there any real assortment issues in select businesses, there aren't. We need to execute at a higher level, and we need to -- to the level that we're capable of doing and that we have been doing. And so that's really what we need to do as an organization. \nOperator: And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I will now turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for final remarks. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations.  \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2022 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.  \n As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our lower-than-expected first quarter results. We knew 2022 would be a difficult year to predict, especially the first half when we were facing last year's record levels of government stimulus and significant customer pent-up demand as COVID restrictions eased. The external environment has also proven extremely challenging as the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated inflationary pressures on the consumer not seen in 40 years. As a result of these factors, our first quarter results underperformed our expectations.  \n Total sales for the first quarter were $4.3 billion with comparable store sales down 7% on top of a robust 13% gain in the first quarter of 2021 that were versus 2019. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022, were $0.97 on net income of $338 million.  \n The quarter includes an approximate benefit of $0.06 per share from the favorable timing of expenses that are expected to reverse in subsequent quarters. These results compared to $1.34 per share on net earnings of $476 million for the 13 weeks ended May 1, 2021.  \n Men's was the strongest merchandise area during the quarter, while Florida was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter trailed that of Ross, as the significant benefit of last year's stimulus and escalating inflationary pressures had a larger impact on lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 57% versus the same period in 2021, mainly from higher packaway inventory.  \n Packaway merchandise represented 43% of total inventories versus 34% last year when we used a substantial amount of packaway to meet robust consumer demand. Additionally, supply chain congestion eased somewhat during the first quarter, resulting in the early receipt of merchandise that we stored in packaway and will flow to stores later in the year. Average store inventories during the quarter were up, though we still operated with significantly less inventory in store than we did pre-pandemic.  \n Turning to store growth. Our 2022 expansion program is on schedule with the addition of 22 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNT locations in the first quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 100 locations this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores.  \n Now Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Thank you, Adam. Looking ahead, while the landscape in early 2022 has been tougher than expected and the year may prove to be more difficult than initially anticipated, we remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate through this period. We have shown in the past that our value-focused business model has served us well in both healthy and more uncertain external climates and believe the current challenging conditions will be no different. Despite the slower-than-expected start to 2022, we operate in an attractive sector of retailing. Our mission continues to be delivering the best bargains possible to leverage our favorable market position. As demonstrated by our long successful track record, we believe our steadfast focus on the execution of this core strategy will be the key driver of our success.  \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. In terms of -- let's start with the pockets of inventory in aggregate. At this stage, Kimberly, in the market, there's a lot of availability. And it's very broad based, whether it's in home or whether it's in apparel, there's a lot of supply out there. So I wouldn't really say that there are problems in any pockets of inventory that we have.  \n In terms of execution in products -- in merchandise, here's what I would say. I would say that we didn't execute at the level that we're capable of. We're digging into the business now and we feel that we can improve the assortments and we can improve our execution. So at this point, it's really about us. It's about us taking different actions in some of our assortments overall, I would say. And Lorraine, in terms of the assortment, what happened last year is that merchandise slid, as I'm sure it did for all retailers. Different product categories created real gaps in the assortment. So as you get into fall and the inventories catch up with where those gaps were gives you the confidence in certain businesses that the performance should be better. In terms of a slowdown, Michael, from one quarter to another, I can't really think of a period of time were we baked in that other than in 2016, where we had difficulty in the ladies business, where we had a slowdown... And then in terms of the assortment, apparel outperformed home. We were up against very large comps in home in Q1. And so that's really where we saw a large difference in performance. And as we dig into the opportunities of the businesses that we did miss and that we didn't have last year, that would be part of what we're looking at to improve the business. So making the shift in your example into more dress versus casual and making the appropriate move. So we're digging into that piece now. Sure. The AUR strategy, we strategically increased prices. So we didn't do it just straight across the board. So what we really did was make sure that there was appropriate price separation from traditional retailers. And so we monitor that very, very closely. \n And so the merchants can see on the term line every single week whether something is working or not. And so that piece will continue to do in both companies really with a high focus on value, right? So that a slightly higher AUR might be a very strong value based on what's going on in the rest of the world. So I think the value equation, to your point, is really what our customer looks for and comes to expect from us. And so we are highly focused on the value equation. But that doesn't mean that potentially an AUR could be higher. So they're not mutually exclusive. It could be both ways. You really have to know where and what. Well, the merchants can take advantage of the closeout opportunities as they become available. And there are closeouts in home, and that's more unusual than it is in apparel. Supply lines right now are very broad-based based of all the things that you know. Goods coming in early. People bringing in fall early. So it's kind of all collided at the same time into the marketplace. But the merchants can take advantage of that as quickly as possible, if it's the right merchandise and right product. So there's nothing in their way to keep them from doing that. In terms of packaway, we're very comfortable with the content of packaway also. And home penetration is around 25% of the company's... I think that doesn't just come from Northeast retailers. I think there's a lot of spring goods that came into the country and spring -- last fall, plus early spring kind of all collided and came into the country pretty much at the same time. So part of it, I'm sure, comes from Northeast retailers. And part of it just comes in from the supply that came into the country as the congestion eased all at the same time. And we've been able to buy appropriately the things we want in spring products. So yes, there will be spring products that we can use from Q1 into Q2. What you would define as the Easter assortments, Marni, dresses, dress shoes, children's dresses, those just were fine. It depends on the product. So the packaway that we picked up in Q4, so you're thinking it's like outerwear. So if it was outwear, it's seasonal. That packaway would obviously ship from the vendor when -- at the end of December, let's say, and would release in the fall season. But if you get -- there are other classifications of products like denim, like fleece, like knits or parts of home that are seasonless that can flow all along. So that can flow in Q1, can flow in Q2. A lot of packaway products are seasonless. So depending on the product itself. Sure. So as we've talked about before, we started to increase some of our AURs. Keeping in mind that it has to be the appropriate value separation from traditional retailers and in both companies. And we're strategically doing it. It's not just straight across the board and obviously examining that very closely, does it make sense or not. And you can do that simply by how quickly the goods turn and the markdown rate. \n So the merchants are managing that every week while they're going through their selling. And then we're reviewing it, obviously, at a higher level to make sure that, that hasn't been an issue. But in both companies and particularly in dd's where the customer is very price sensitive, we really look at that at a pretty low level. I think it goes back to what Michael was saying. It's not -- we had one major mistake or one major business that's really underperforming. We don't feel that we executed at the level that we're capable of. And so that might be something as simple as we should have bought more career versus casual, a shift of penetration of a few points, Filling up the delivery of something. It's just not quite as crisp as we normally are. There's no -- if the real question is, are there any real assortment issues in select businesses, there aren't. We need to execute at a higher level, and we need to -- to the level that we're capable of doing and that we have been doing. And so that's really what we need to do as an organization. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were down 7% for the quarter as average basket growth was more than offset by the decline in transactions versus the prior year. First quarter operating margin of 10.8% was down from 14.2% in 2021, mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the same-store sales decline, along with ongoing cost pressures from higher freight and wages that began to escalate in the second half of 2021.  \n As Barbara commented earlier, the quarter benefited from the favorable timing of expenses, most of which were in gross margin. Cost of goods sold in the first quarter increased by 295 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin declined 170 basis points, primarily due to higher ocean freight costs. Domestic freight rose 80 basis points while occupancy delevered 40 basis points on the same-store sales decline. Distribution costs increased 25 basis points, mainly due to wage actions taken last year. These unfavorable items were partially offset by buying expenses that improved by 20 basis points. SG&A for the period rose 50 basis points due to higher wages and the deleveraging effect of lower comparable sales. \n During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $240 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.  \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2022. As Barbara noted in today's press release, given our first quarter results and today's increasingly uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, we believe it is prudent to adopt a more conservative outlook for the balance of the year. We are now forecasting comparable sales for the 13 weeks ending July 30, 2022, to decrease 4% to 6% on top of a very strong 15% gain in the prior year period. Second quarter earnings per share are projected to be $0.99 to $1.07 versus $1.39 last year.  \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2022 include the following: Total sales are forecast to decline 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 29 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 10.4% to 10.8% range, down from 2021 due to deleverage on lower same-store sales and ongoing expense headwinds that are expected to continue through the first half of 2022. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $15 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 348 million.  \n For the full year, we are now planning comparable store sales to decline 2% to 4% and earnings per share in the range of $4.34 to $4.58. As Barbara mentioned, this reflects our continued expectation for sales and profitability to improve as we move through the balance of the year.  \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. And Barbara, this is Adam. I can jump in on the merchandise margin question, and then throw it back to you.  So Kimberly merchandise margin, as stated in the comments, has dropped 170 basis points versus last year. But we would have been flat versus last year's significant gain without the impact of ocean freight. Yes. And touching on the ocean freight question, they will remain elevated throughout the balance of 2022. But as we anniversary that spike that we had in the second half last year, they remain elevated but improved through the balance of the year. \n And on the domestic freight side, as Michael commented, fuel costs are higher than our expectations at the beginning of the year, but we've offset that in the guidance that we've provided to you. And by the second half, we don't really -- we don't see any pressure on domestic freight. Yes. And later in the year, profitability improvement really on that flattish sales. We're going to go up against the anniversary of not only the wage side of it, but also domestic and ocean freight costs. So we'll anniversary those significant increases versus last year. So that's really providing the lift that you're seeing in the model."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Mark,  it's Michael Hartshorn. On our trend during the quarter, ours was, we -- following a fairly strong start to the period -- the start to the quarter, for us, sales underperformed over the balance of the quarter. And I think, most importantly, there was us anniversarying the government stimulus and customer pent-up demand last year. We also didn't see a pickup during Easter that we had planned into the business. And we wouldn't comment on inter-quarter trends at this point.  \n On the trade-down customer, it's hard to say. Obviously, with higher fuel and food prices, discretionary spending for the lower-end customer is being squeezed. We saw customers at both chains pull back on spending in the first quarter.  \n In terms of trade down, the best proxy we would have, although every recession is different, would be 2008, when the fall of 2008 was very difficult and we started to see some improvement in the first half of 2009. Lorraine, on the top line, the guidance assumes a fairly steady pace. In the fourth quarter, we know -- for instance, we have opportunity because we're up against Omicron, and we had supply chain congestion that we know we lost business in the fourth quarter last year.  \n In terms of profitability, as we said, when we started the year, we do have -- we did make wage increases in the back half of 2021. And we also -- that is also where we started to see the freight increases. So the guidance assumes that we lap those increases from last year.  \n Overall, what you see in our changed guidance is really just sales. We haven't changed our expense assumptions. When we came into the year, we thought we had a good grasp on freight, ocean freight, wages. And the only thing that's slightly changed there is fuel, but we've been able to offset those in other costs in the business. So the updated guidance really is a sales flow-through. Yes. I mean, Matthew, we knew there was going to be a slowdown, at least on a comp level with all the government stimulus that came out last year. So we had actually planned that in the business and also with the customer pent-up demand as COVID restrictions ease. \n So even in our initial guidance, the low end of the range was a minus 4, so we missed that by about 3 points. In terms of where in the business has slowed down, it was pretty broad-based. We did see pockets of opportunity. If you look at our larger markets, Texas and Florida outperformed. We had expected, as the border opened up, that we'd see improvement there. We, in fact, did in Florida as tourism and travel started to increase. We had planned increases there, and we saw improvement. Michael, I would just say overall, I mean, it serves us well to be given our underperformance in Q1 to be cautious with the rest of the year. And that's why you saw us bring down the guidance. And that's true from buying inventory to running the company with lower expenses. So we'll see how it plays out. I mean it's very uncertain out there. The inflationary environment was much more than we expected when we entered the year, and we're going to put ourselves in a position to chase business and to chase trends, and we think that will allow us to maximize our potential in this environment. And we -- on your question on the guidance, we have not built any upside on that into our guidance. I'll start with the -- your last question first on inventory there. So overall, the growth in inventories was really packaway. We ended with 43% of the total inventories versus 34% last year. And if you can remember from last year, we used a substantial amount of that packaway to backstop the demand we saw at the end of the first quarter when the stimulus came out. So the 34% was lower than our historical levels. \n The second piece relates to supply chain congestion. When we came into the year, we planned longer lead times based on what we saw in the fourth quarter. So what that meant for us, for businesses where we directly import mainly in home, what happened in Q1 is the supply chain eased somewhat and we received early second quarter goods in home, and we stored them in packaway and will flow them later in the year. \n As far as in-store inventories, we operated up from last year, but remember, again, they were lower than we had anticipated with the frenzied demand, but well below pre-pandemic levels. And so I would say, overall, we're happy with our overall inventory levels. We wouldn't give you the unit growth. That's not something we disclose. Can you repeat the question? We don't disclose that externally. Could you repeat that question? I don't know. Can we -- why don't we call you after the call and get specific modeling questions for you? In terms of overall home apparel, I think Barbara mentioned earlier that apparel outperformed home, although home was up against very strong comps last year. Adrienne, we also talked a little bit about the trend, and that was similar for traffic in that we had a strong start to the year, so year-over-year growth. And then that dropped in later in the quarter as we started to anniversary the stimulus and also customer pent-up demand. Marni, on the inventory, we actually ended with store inventory where we wanted them. So there isn't any liquidation past the first quarter. \n And then on Easter -- I commented earlier on Easter, and that was versus our expectations. Typically, when there's a later Easter, you have less weather. So we missed our own expectations there in our plan. I would say, overall, the traffic is probably a large function of the consumer being squeezed with inflation. On the back half, that it does include our easiest compare in the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter would be the stronger comp. On packaway, on average, packaway, we hold it for about 4 months. So that's the way you should think about the timing on when we typically flow goods. Sure. On the -- first of all, our overall customer is very broad, age-wise, ethnicity, and income-wise. On average, the Ross customer makes between 60 -- household income, $60,000 to $65,000. And the dd's customer is south of that, in the $40,000, $45,000 range. But I would say the health of our customer, they're being squeezed. Food and fuel prices with inflation there means they have less to spend on discretionary items. Yes. At this point, Dana, we wouldn't change our glide path. We're planning to open 100 this year, and we will execute to that. And then we'll revisit our long-term plans. But we think there's market share available. We think there's market share opportunities. \n We think value will becoming increasingly important for the customer as it has over the last number of years. And we think we have a great opportunity ahead of us. So we would continue with our store opening plan. Laura, the weather did not have a material impact on the business in the quarter. California was relatively in line with the chain and then -- of our bigger markets, which you mentioned, Texas and Florida. On dd's, dd's did trail Ross, but they were up against stronger gains last year, especially with the government stimulus that has an outsized impact on that consumer and also last year's stimulus, with -- at their income levels, they were also more impacted by inflation than the Ross customer. Sure. We -- it's best to start from last year. So last year, the lead times degradated as we move through the year, so they got longer. So we planned the year based on what we saw in the fourth quarter. And what we saw in the first quarter is it did ease somewhat, which meant we received goods early. \n Expectations for going forward, I think, will be highly dependent on how China comes back from their shutdown. So we're watching that very closely. We're going to be very cautious with our lead times, but I think it's going to be dependent on whether when they open back up and the timing of when it opens back up, what type of congestion that causes. Yes, I think what we're saying is we know we can do better. So in this environment -- inflationary environment, I mean, none of us have been in this for 40 years. So we know we can offer our customer better bargains, and we'll do that. So it's -- we wouldn't be able to break out execution versus the impact on inflation in the consumer."

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and fiscal 2023 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. \n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2023 performance followed by our outlook for 2024. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above-plan sales were driven by our customers' positive response to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, were $1.82, up from $1.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year. \n Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $6 billion, driven by robust comparable store sales gain of 7%. For the 2023 fiscal year, earnings per share were $5.56, up from $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the fiscal 2023 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. \n Total sales for the year increased to $20.4 billion, up from $18.7 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2024, grew a solid 5%. As noted in our press release, the sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53rd week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share. Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in 2022. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same-store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher incentives. The 53rd week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points. \n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics, home and Children's were the best-performing merchandise areas, while geographic results were broad-based. Dd's discount sales trends slightly trailed Ross' growth. While dd's top line results were respectable in fiscal 2023, we are disappointed with the performance in newer markets. \n We are currently conducting an in-depth analysis of dd's to better understand and address the different wants and needs of their diverse customer base, particularly as we expand outside our current existing geographies. Until this work is completed, we believe it is wise over the near term to moderate dd's store growth in newer markets and focus new store openings, primarily in existing regions. \n Now let's turn to inventory. As we ended the quarter and the year, consolidated inventories were up 8%. Average store inventories were up 9% compared to 2022's holiday period due primarily to the 53rd week shift. Packaway represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. Regarding our store expansion program, we added 94 net new stores in 2023, including 71 Ross Stores, Ross Dress for Less and 23 dd's DISCOUNTS. We ended 2023 with 2,109 stores, including 1,764 Ross Dress for Less and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As we noted in today's release, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million and 8.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $247 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022, which we have now completed as planned. \n Our Board of Directors also recently approved a new 2-year, $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization or approximately $1.05 billion for each fiscal year. This new plan represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase program. In addition, the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share to be payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of business. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2024. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose a strong 7% for the quarter, entirely driven by higher traffic and shoppers positive response to our improved assortments throughout our stores.\n As Barbara noted earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was up 165 basis points from 10.7% in 2022 and included about an 80 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2023. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales improved by 265 basis points versus last year, benefiting from a combination of factors. \n Merchandise gross margin increased by 110 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Distribution costs declined by 75 basis points partially driven by favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy costs levered by 75 and 45 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying costs that increased 40 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A for the period delevered by 100 basis points, mostly driven by higher incentive costs and wages. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our press release, we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season. That said, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments. In addition, while inflation has moderated, prices for necessities like housing, food and gasoline remain elevated and continue to pressure the low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend. While we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, we are planning comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year compared to 53 weeks in 2023. As previously mentioned, our 2023 earnings per share benefited from an additional $0.20 of EPS from the extra week. \n Turning to our guidance assumptions for the 2024 year. Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 4% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, versus the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This year-over-year increase in total revenue is affected by last year's 53rd week, which added approximately $308 million to sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2023. If same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% compared to 11.3% last year, which benefited by 25 basis points from the 53rd week. This year-over-year change also includes the benefit of anniversarying higher incentive costs in 2023, given our outperformance. In addition, for fiscal 2024, we expect merchandise margins to be pressured as we plan to offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. For 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. \n Net interest income is estimated to be $143 million. Depreciation amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $610 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2024 are planned to be approximately $840 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business. \n Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. We are planning comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending May 4, 2024, to be up 2% to 3% versus a 1% gain in last year's first quarter. If sales perform in line with this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be $1.29 to $1.35 versus $1.09 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: total sales are planned to be up 6% to 8% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 11.1% to 11.4% compared to 10.1% last year. The expected increase mainly reflects our forecast for lower incentives and freight costs that are partially offset by lower merchandise margin and higher wages. We plan to add 18 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $44 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecasted to be about $335 million. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. To sum up, as Adam noted, while we hope to do better than our forecast this year, the external environment remains uncertain and our low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend continues to be impacted by elevated cost of living. Despite these headwinds last year, our shoppers responded positively to the strong values we offered across our stores which drove our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth throughout 2023. \n In 2024, we plan to build upon these efforts and offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. We believe the diligent execution of this plan will result in increased market share gains this year and in the future. At this point, we'd like to open the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Barbara, I was hoping to better understand the dynamic around the sharply priced brands and their impact on merchandise margins. How big of the -- how large of a percentage of the assortment were you planning to take down to these sharper price points? And is there other opportunity to improve on the gross margins through domestic freight or other line items as the year progresses? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure, Lorraine. So let's just talk about the sharply priced brands. Obviously, I wouldn't talk about what type of penetration we're going to shift to. What I would say to you about the sharply priced brands is that during '23, we strengthened our value offerings. We kept saying that we were doing that, and we were doing that. And that really results in the acceleration of sales and started in Q2 and then persisted through the whole holiday season. And so that's really how we came up with in 2024, that we planned to build upon those successes that we had in '23 by offering more brands that are sharply priced to deliver that value proposition the customer wants. But what I would say to you also is it's a tiered strategy; a good, better, best strategy. \n So in terms of gross margin expansion from the pure merchandising side. What I would say to you is this strategy really -- we really believe that this will drive sales and it will drive market share. And that's really how we're looking at it. Because that's what the customer has voted on all year, and we feel like it's a strategy that's broad-based in the entire box. Certainly, there are some businesses that have more opportunities than others. But that's really how we came to this conclusion and the customer has been voting, and that's really what she's been voting on. \nMichael Hartshorn: Lorraine, then on just the other margin opportunities from a freight standpoint, from a domestic freight standpoint, we do expect to see some improvement for the full year, but to a lesser extent than we saw last year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: And congrats on another great quarter. So Barbara, I guess maybe could you elaborate on drivers that you think really were behind? I think this is the best fourth quarter performance in more than 10 years, if I exclude the pandemic. Maybe what you saw across categories, do you think that you're attracting a new customer? And maybe just the decision to raise your initial comp view for 2024 to the 2% to 3% relative to historical 1% to 2%? And then just one for Adam. Any change to bottom line flow-through in the model for 2024 as we think about incremental comp potential upside? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's Michael Hartshorn. Just on the customer overall. It's hard to see whether it's a new customer or the existing customer is spending more. What we did see is our performance, as we said in the commentary was broad-based across region, but it was broad-based really across all aspects of our business, including geographically, income levels and age. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of -- Matthew, in terms of the drivers, the categories, the ones that I said, cosmetics, home and Children's were really the best, Accessories was slightly above the chain and apparel trailed the chain. But again, it performed above our plan. And I think part of the things that really drove it was we had a big push this year in home on gifting, and we added some new classifications and the customer responded. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. And on the flow-through question, this is Adam. Nothing has changed. We expect EBIT margin flow-through of about 10 to 15 basis points for each additional point of above-plan sales. And with our guide of plus 2% to 3%. And on a 52-week basis, you see margin rate expansion. We're getting some benefit also this year of lower incentive costs based on our outperformance from 2023. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Maybe first, Barbara, just any hypothesis on what might be driving the weaker-than-expected dd's performance in newer markets? And maybe comment also on how the Ross Dress for Less stores in newer markets have been performing relative to your expectations? \nMichael Hartshorn: Just on -- I'll start with the Ross. The Ross new markets have been performing at or above our expectations. From a dd's standpoint, as we said in the commentary, the overall comp was just is slightly below Ross for both the quarter and the year. So while overall comps were respectable, we've been disappointed in the dd's new market performance. Our new markets tend to be more diverse based on ethnicity and income, and we clearly didn't satisfy them with the assortments we've been offering there. \nMark Altschwager: Maybe just a follow-up. Can you comment on the buying environment and any changes you're seeing? And how is that impacting the expectations for the merchandise margin pressure this year, if at all? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, I think it's a positive buying environment. I mean there's still merchandise in the market. And I've said this on calls before, there are some vendors that are very aggressive in bringing in inventory as they're trying to gain market share and then others, it's more normalized. In terms of merchant margin, our strategy now is really to continue to offer the customer really great value because that is really, really what's working sharp prices. And so even if you're buying some of these really great opportunities, we are really thinking about passing along really that potential savings to the customer because we really do believe that is the best way to drive market -- to gain market share. And so that's really how we're approaching it at this point, and that is what the customer is responding to. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Great results. From a category perspective, which categories do you view is the biggest opportunities in 2024? And curious, separately what you're seeing on the shrink front in the quarter and what your expectations are for '24? A couple of retailers, including Target today have called out improving shrink results lately. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of categories for '24, I mean, with the brand strategy we're putting in place, I feel like there's -- it's pretty broad-based the opportunity. But obviously, our apparel business has been trailing the chain. And so we're focused on really trying to improve those assortments and to get the apparel business more in line with the other businesses. \nMichael Hartshorn: Chuck, on the shrink front, I would say we're not immune to the external theft and organized crime environment throughout retail. We do continue to invest in initiatives to hold shortage at bay. For 2023, our shrink levels were in line with 2022. Our guidance assumes that shrink is up a bit. So that's built into the guidance, but we'll continue to make investments there to keep it in line. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a really nice holiday. And I apologize if you said it, but did you mention how much the extra week impacted the gross margin in the fourth quarter? I heard the operating margin, but just housekeeping on that. And then, I guess, maybe we could talk a little bit about how you built to the comp guidance for the year with the 2% to 3% comp in the first quarter and in the year? I guess, as the comparisons get a little tougher, I think it implies the 2-year accelerates a little bit as we move through the year. So maybe just a little bit on how you were thinking about that. I'm wondering if that's maybe the sharp price merchandise assortment strategy accelerating through the year. Anything you could point to help us think alongside you on that, please? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So from the merchandise strategy, we do expect it to accelerate as we go. Obviously, we've been building the strategy off of starting in Q2 of 2023. And now -- I would say now it's more broad-based than we were as we were coming across. Maybe the words I want to use is it's a little more intentional in certain businesses than it was before. And so we do expect that as we come across. We are expecting that our Apparel business as we move through the year will improve. \nAdam Orvos: And Michael, on the 53rd week question, so we thought operating margin was worth 80 basis points in Q4 and about 25 for the year, and that was largely in gross margin versus SG&A. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: Perfect. Super amazing [ trend ]. It looks like you guys are further closing the gap to pre-COVID EBIT with every passing quarter, even though fourth quarter still sits somewhat below. So can you just talk about what's hampering you from returning to the pre-COVID levels and how you think about recovering that gap from here? And then maybe Barbara, a big picture question for you. What are your key priorities for the year as you think about Ross? \nMichael Hartshorn: Alex, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the long-term kind of what it's going to take to close the EBIT margin gap. Obviously, the biggest drivers are where wages and freight has been over the last couple of years. I would say over the long term, we can -- we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. As always, EBIT growth will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth. We believe the improvements we've made and continue to make to strengthen our value offerings will lead to market share gains in the long run. I'll also say we're investing in capabilities to drive efficiencies and related cost savings that we believe will contribute to profitability as well over time. As you can see in this year's guidance, our EBIT leverage is around 3% with double-digit EPS growth at the top end of that 2% to 3% range on a 52-week basis. Over the long term, we think we can get leverage in the 3% to 4% comp range. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of priorities, our priority this year is really to gain market share through a diligent execution of the strategy. We've done a lot of work around what we believe we need to do to gain market share. And so on the Ross side, that really is mine and our key priority. And then on the dd's side to go off and to do some additional work, to understand that customer. So as we go into newer markets, we satisfy her needs. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. And let me add my congratulations as well. Barbara, on the dd's, I was wondering if you could talk about sort of the new store strategy? Are you clustering them? What regions outside of California or is it within kind of the West Coast are seeing the differences? So any more detail on kind of your early thoughts on what's happening there other than sort of the broader demographic mix. And then Michael or Adam, on the transaction, can you talk about the fourth quarter, the holiday transaction growth versus the AUR component? \nMichael Hartshorn: Adrienne, on dd's. So our real estate strategy for dd's is a little different than Ross. It's not as a clustered strategy, as you said, as we see for Ross. There is -- after you get outside of our core markets in Texas, Florida and California, they are, as I said, distinct ethnicity differences, which means we have to find the right assortment that's different from our core markets. We'll know more after we go through the customer research, and then we'll make -- start making the adjustments we think we need to improve performance there. \nAdam Orvos: And Adrienne, on to your question on the components. Our 7% comp was all driven by traffic. Average basket was flat. So we had slightly higher AUR and slightly lower items per transaction. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: I was hoping you could elaborate on the assumptions embedded in your outlook for SG&A expense for the year. What are you assuming for wage and other investments? And what are you seeing in the wage environment currently? \nAdam Orvos: I would say it's somewhat stabilized, Brooke. Really where we're taking wage increases is where the -- where we're required to by the minimum wage changes state by state. I would say from an SG&A standpoint, we'll get the benefit of anniversarying the higher incentive costs. And then, we've generally been able to do a good job while the minimum wage changes are putting pressure in the stores. Through some of the efficiencies that we've invested in, we've generally been able to offset that. So I'm not seeing much overall pressure on the store side on that front. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nIrwin Boruchow: Michael, maybe to you, I think to answering your question earlier, you had said that you expect freight to be a benefit this year but less so than in '23. Were you referring to domestic freight specifically? Are you talking to freight, including ocean freight within the merchandise margin loan? \nMichael Hartshorn: In that one, I was talking about domestic freight, but I'll let Adam take it to speak on this. \nAdam Orvos: Ike, this is Adam. So on the ocean freight side, we'll get a little bit of benefit in Q1, but kind of negligible over the course of the year. Obviously, this is going to be dependent on how the situation plays out in the Suez Canal. And the duration of that conflict if anything changes. But I would also say that impacts a very small portion of our freight, yet we're closely monitoring that situation. On the domestic side, that's what Michael was commenting on earlier because fuel prices are lower than where they were at least this time last year. And based on our contracted rates, we should see some slight benefit throughout the year on the domestic side. \nIrwin Boruchow: Got it. So slight benefits throughout the year on domestic. Adam, just based on the line of sight you have, is there any point in this year where ocean freight should flip to -- from a tailwind to a headwind? Or is it just kind of like flattening out for you guys? \nAdam Orvos: We'll have to see how that conflict plays out is probably the biggest variable hike. We have a fairly good line of sight other than that variable that we can't control. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Nice job. Sorry, if I missed it, but did you talk about whether any of the transaction -- the traffic increases, are you seeing any trade down benefit? And then probably a dumb question, but does the sharply priced brands impact where you are at all, impact where you are or is it really -- is it just creating better value proposition without impacting AUR? And if it does, any order of magnitude we should keep in mind? \nMichael Hartshorn: Simeon, on the trade down customer, we did -- I'll just repeat that for us, it's hard to see whether there's a trade down customer performance. Was broad-based, as we said, across geographies, but it was also broad-based across income levels. So hard to really tease out any impact to the trade down. On the transaction data, the comp was entirely driven by traffic or transactions for us. The average basket was flat as slightly higher average unit retails were offset by slightly lower units per transaction. And then on the weather front, it was neutral for us. \nSimeon Siegel: So the sharply priced brands impacting going forward? Should we think about that from an AUR context? Or is that just changing the concentration of brands? \nBarbara Rentler: It's -- the AUR fluctuates. It's based on the mix and the value of the goods that we're buying. So there's not a specific AUR pricing strategy. It's really a value strategy as we buy goods and put them at the sharpest price as we can to offer great value. So it's not like we're trying to hit a specific AUR or -- it could move as we go through the year and as we go through different closeouts, products and all of that, we're expecting it to move around. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nPaul Lejuez: At dd's, I'm curious how many stores are in region where you considered disappointing and what percentage of the store base do they represent? I'm curious if they didn't open as strongly as you thought? Or are they not comping as quickly as you thought? And also curious how the Ross Stores are performing in those same regions? \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, I mean there are certain stores outside of our core markets, that's what I would say on number of stores. So you can see our store map. As far as Ross, Ross is performing fine in these markets. And it's really how they opened. Some of them are comping well, but they're comping off a low sales base. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then you mentioned, I think, 10 to 15 store closings. How did that break down, dd's versus Ross? \nAdam Orvos: Store closings. So we talked about -- Paul, we talked about 10 to 15 either relocated or closing stores, and we won't get into Ross versus dd's on that front. \nMichael Hartshorn: Nor have we decided yet. Usually, these are stores, I think, Paul, as you know, these are at the end of the lease term or starting a new option period where we'll make that judgment as we progress through the year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with The Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congrats on a really nice quarter. And I'm going to hop in on the pricing question. I'm really sorry. But I want to just clarify the sharp price pricing because it sounds like Barbara, you're thinking about this a little bit more holistically, sort of getting to a better balance of really sharp opening prices and then layering that next level and the next level, versus looking at what you purchased and maybe taking a shorter margin here and a longer margin there. Is that right? Am I hearing that right? \nBarbara Rentler: Whenever you're pricing goods, Marni, you're always doing what you're saying. You're looking at the product and you're looking at the value, right? So it doesn't necessarily always have to do with what you're paying for a product, right? The merchants are looking at it and saying this is the right value and they're doing it. I think the sharp pricing that we're talking about is really adding more brands at all 3 levels, good, better, best, assessing those brands and then putting them out at the values that the customers really responded to. So it's -- it's really built on the products themselves. \n I don't know how else to say that to you. We have the brands we want to have. We have [ visits and ] people who are growing. We've opened a lot of new resources this year. The merchants have been out really looking for new resources, looking to expand, looking to remix the products and labels themselves and then to put that mix out at sharp prices. So it's not like I'm looking to have x price point or x in each thing. It is really a value strategy, not a pricing strategy. It's a value strategy. \nMarni Shapiro: And where does beauty -- because it sounds like you had a nice quarter in beauty that typically carries a lower AUR, but can drive a lot of traffic? Does beauty carry a good margin? And where does beauty fit into the strategy for '24? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, Beauty has so many components in there from a margin perspective. Overall, the beauty margins are fine or good. In every business we went in and looked at what our values were, what our brands were, what our product offerings were and we went in and said, some businesses we thought were on track and we're fine. In some businesses, we're learning we have more opportunity after what we've learned starting in Q2 all the way through Q3 and Q4 and building on that. So it's kind of an evolving process. But there's -- again, it's really a merchant-driven process and making sure that we put out the best possible value in the things that the customer wants and that we have the right brands, the right recognizable brands at each level; good, better and best. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: I have two, please. I'm curious about -- can you talk about the cadence of comps through the quarter, particularly coming out of holiday into January and where you were exiting the quarter? And I have another one on stores. You talked about initiatives in the stores, and you've talked about it for the last couple of quarters. Do you see more structural benefits to store 4-wall margins over the next year or so from the store initiatives that you've been rolling out? \nMichael Hartshorn: Aneesha, it's Michael. On both of those. So we typically don't talk about inter-quarter trends. I will say, on a stack basis, comps were the -- slightly stronger during the peak holiday period, holiday selling period. On the 4-wall margin, so the type of investments we're making in stores, we're making a number of investments to improve efficiencies in the stores. In many cases, that's just offsetting some of the minimum wage -- statutory minimum wage increases we've seen. Some of the things we're doing are technology investments for instance, we're piloting self-checkout in all stores. We don't ever think that that's going to be a full chain rollout, but we'll see how that goes. We've put in place more efficient handheld devices and it's used to check inventory, take markdowns, manage tasks and eventually even allow associate scheduling within the store, all drive efficiency that help us offset the rising minimum wages. \nAneesha Sherman: Sorry, just a quick follow-up, Michael. Can you give us a sense of how much of that has already been rolled out versus how much is to come over the next fiscal year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, I mean there are things beyond that. This fiscal year, we have a number of rollouts. And as Adam said earlier, that's fully offsetting the minimum wage increase. And we continue to have new initiatives in the pipeline going forward. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the very nice results. As you think about the store profile in 2024 for both dd's and Ross, any changes in how you're thinking about it in terms of size? And then Barbara, you've always talked in the past about adding to the merchant team. What does it look like this year in terms of number of buyers, merchants added to the team or how you're thinking about it? \nMichael Hartshorn: Staying on the store profile, I'll give you the easy answer on that one. No, we're not thinking of any changes to the store prototype as we move into '24. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the size of the merchant team, we have over 900 merchants. So every year, we -- every year, we promote people, move people. But in terms of saying, am I going out to take up the head count substantially? I think it's just -- I think it's more of a normal cadence that we would have. We feel like we have a pretty large team between the two companies. \nDana Telsey: Just one follow-up. As you went through the quarter in January, we know there were those two weeks that were very cold. Was that an impact for you and the comps and the comps would have even been stronger if you hadn't had that weather issue that happened mid-January? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, on the quarter overall, so we take puts and takes all the way November through December, we think the weather impact was neutral for us. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. In the past, I know you've talked about 60% to 65% new store productivity. Given your comments on dd's, recognizing that it's a smaller portion of the fleet, is that a consistent assumption within your guidance for 2024? \nMichael Hartshorn: It continues to be because the vast majority of the new stores are Ross. That said, the stores that we are opening for dd's, we expect them to be similar to historical sales levels because they're in the existing markets. But overall, 60% to 65% of a comp. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. And then just a brief follow-up. Other than new stores, what areas are you investing in, in the CapEx? And how are you thinking about leveraging AI in your business? \nMichael Hartshorn: So first on where else we're investing, about 40% of the capital this year is just expanded capacity. So we're opening a -- plan to open a new DC in early '25 in Arizona, and we have another one, a DC that we're going to start construction on later this year on our next distribution center. So 40% of that capital this year is on increased DC capacity. AI, I would say there's two parts of AI. We already use AI in some of the automated parts of our business. I think generative AI will be a journey for us like it is for others, but it is something we'll be looking at to find efficiencies in the business. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen & Co. \nJohn Kernan: Great job on the holiday quarter. Just going back to stores. Ross Stores banner grew 4% this year. I think that was the fastest store growth since pre-COVID, dd's is up over 7%. How do we think about store growth not just for fiscal '24, but also beyond that and how that fits into your long-term store targets? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. First of all, our long-term store target hasn't changed, and that's 2,900 Ross Stores and 700 for dd's. I think you'd expect about 100 stores a year, depending on how the dd's plays out beyond this. But I think we're comfortable with the 75 Ross stores annually. That's a good fit for us, and we'll see where the dd's roll out after we get through our strategy. \nJohn Kernan: You haven't seen any long-term change in terms of competition for real estate, your peers in off-price are growing a lot of stores, too. I think there's been concerns about some of the availability out there, but it doesn't sound like you have any concerns? \nMichael Hartshorn: Well, there is -- I would say there's a lot of -- there's a lot of competition for our locations. But I'd say overall, we feel good about the real estate landscape and have a healthy pipeline. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets. \nLaura Champine: It's related to the way we're reading stores, which to us looks like you're making a conscious decision to sharply control inventories, to maximize profits and minimize markdowns. Are we reading that right? Or is this just a small sample size of stores? \nAdam Orvos: Laura, are you just talking about inventory levels at year-end? Is that your question? \nLaura Champine: I'm talking about inventory levels that we're seeing currently over the past couple of months in stores really post holiday. \nMichael Hartshorn: I would say post holiday for us is really a clearance period. So -- it is our lowest inventories of the year and it happens to be our lowest sales period. So we want to start off the year correctly. So it doesn't surprise me that it would feel that way if you're looking at the stores in January. I think as you progress through the spring, we manage our in-store inventories based on term, and we set it up. If we can beat the plan, then we can leverage markdowns. So that's the way we run the business, and we try to beat the turn from the previous year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. \nKrisztina Katai: Congratulations on the strong quarter. So I wanted to ask in terms of the competitive backdrop, many of bigger general merchandise retailer are still look fairly lean on inventory, I think especially when we look at apparel and certain discretionary categories as we head into the spring. So I just -- I was just curious how that's sort of incorporated into your thinking on comps and maybe where you see some of the biggest opportunities in the first half to take share. \nBarbara Rentler: Krisztina, I'm not 100% sure what exactly -- what you're getting at exactly. Could you just say that again? \nKrisztina Katai: Sure. It's just that many of your bigger general merchandise peers are still planning inventories very cautiously and they're sort of lean on inventories in many discretionary categories. So as you're sort of planning your business, you're looking at your good, better, best sort of assortment, maybe just how you're thinking about your position for spring and then heading into the summer? \nBarbara Rentler: So the first part in inventory, as Michael just said, we plan our inventory based off of sales and turn. And so -- and we build that by business, really bottom up, just in terms of pure inventory level and then we drive receipts. We have the inventory base we think we need and then we go to chase, and we drive the receipts, which drives the sales which drives the profits. That's from basic inventory. In terms of which categories, that's a merchant-driven strategy in terms of what businesses we're going to go after, where we see the opportunity in the outside world, where we know we can show great value and where we can add assortment. So there are kind of two different levels of thinking. And remember, it's a flexible business model. So if business really takes off and as we've started to beat our sales plans, we have the ability to take the inventory up or drive the inventory down because the model is flexible, the stores are flexible and the products are flexible. So we go -- we start in with our base plan and then again, build up for sales turn and then we go -- then we react to what the customer is telling us. So it's kind of fluid. \nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: Barbara, you talked that one of your goals for the year was taking market share. Is your expectation that you're going to take market share from other off-price retailers or department stores or maybe just a little bit of everybody? \nBarbara Rentler: I just think -- look, I just think there's market share to be had. I mean, more stores keep closing. I mean -- and there's just less places for consumers to shop and our job is to satisfy the customer. And if we do that, there are consumers out there for us to pick up and to expand. So we want to be able to satisfy our current customers and get her to come back more. We want to be able to add additional customers because as we know, as there have been many store closures over the last few years, that's also helped to fuel off-price. So as that continues, this is a focus for us. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our fourth quarter and 2023 performance followed by our outlook for 2024. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased with our fourth quarter sales and earnings results that were well ahead of our expectations. Our above-plan sales were driven by our customers' positive response to the improved assortments of quality branded bargains throughout our stores. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ended February 3, 2024, were $1.82, up from $1.31 per share for the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the period rose to $610 million versus $447 million last year. \n Sales for the fourth quarter of 2023 grew to $6 billion, driven by robust comparable store sales gain of 7%. For the 2023 fiscal year, earnings per share were $5.56, up from $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Net income for the fiscal 2023 was $1.9 billion compared to $1.5 billion last year. \n Total sales for the year increased to $20.4 billion, up from $18.7 billion in the prior year period. Comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ended January 27, 2024, grew a solid 5%. As noted in our press release, the sales results for both the 2023 fourth quarter and fiscal year included a $308 million benefit from the 53rd week. Earnings per share for both periods also benefited from the extra week by approximately $0.20 per share. Fourth quarter operating margin grew 165 basis points to 12.4%, up from 10.7% in 2022. This improvement was mainly due to the strong gains in same-store sales and lower freight costs that were partially offset by higher incentives. The 53rd week also benefited operating margin by 80 basis points. \n Now let's turn to additional details on our fourth quarter results. For the holiday selling season, cosmetics, home and Children's were the best-performing merchandise areas, while geographic results were broad-based. Dd's discount sales trends slightly trailed Ross' growth. While dd's top line results were respectable in fiscal 2023, we are disappointed with the performance in newer markets. \n We are currently conducting an in-depth analysis of dd's to better understand and address the different wants and needs of their diverse customer base, particularly as we expand outside our current existing geographies. Until this work is completed, we believe it is wise over the near term to moderate dd's store growth in newer markets and focus new store openings, primarily in existing regions. \n Now let's turn to inventory. As we ended the quarter and the year, consolidated inventories were up 8%. Average store inventories were up 9% compared to 2022's holiday period due primarily to the 53rd week shift. Packaway represented 40% of total inventories similar to last year. Regarding our store expansion program, we added 94 net new stores in 2023, including 71 Ross Stores, Ross Dress for Less and 23 dd's DISCOUNTS. We ended 2023 with 2,109 stores, including 1,764 Ross Dress for Less and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. As we noted in today's release, for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023, we repurchased a total of 1.9 million and 8.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, for an aggregate purchase price of $247 million in the quarter and $950 million for the fiscal year. These purchases were made pursuant to the 2-year $1.9 billion program announced in March 2022, which we have now completed as planned. \n Our Board of Directors also recently approved a new 2-year, $2.1 billion stock repurchase authorization or approximately $1.05 billion for each fiscal year. This new plan represents an 11% increase over the recently completed repurchase program. In addition, the Board approved a 10% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.3675 per share to be payable on March 29, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2024. The increases to our stock repurchase and dividend programs reflect our continued commitment to enhancing stockholder value and returns, given the strength of our balance sheet and our ongoing ability to generate significant amounts of cash after funding growth and other capital needs of business. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our fourth quarter results and additional color on our outlook for fiscal 2024. Thank you, Adam. To sum up, as Adam noted, while we hope to do better than our forecast this year, the external environment remains uncertain and our low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend continues to be impacted by elevated cost of living. Despite these headwinds last year, our shoppers responded positively to the strong values we offered across our stores which drove our better-than-expected sales and earnings growth throughout 2023. \n In 2024, we plan to build upon these efforts and offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. We believe the diligent execution of this plan will result in increased market share gains this year and in the future. At this point, we'd like to open the call and respond to any questions you may have. Sure, Lorraine. So let's just talk about the sharply priced brands. Obviously, I wouldn't talk about what type of penetration we're going to shift to. What I would say to you about the sharply priced brands is that during '23, we strengthened our value offerings. We kept saying that we were doing that, and we were doing that. And that really results in the acceleration of sales and started in Q2 and then persisted through the whole holiday season. And so that's really how we came up with in 2024, that we planned to build upon those successes that we had in '23 by offering more brands that are sharply priced to deliver that value proposition the customer wants. But what I would say to you also is it's a tiered strategy; a good, better, best strategy. \n So in terms of gross margin expansion from the pure merchandising side. What I would say to you is this strategy really -- we really believe that this will drive sales and it will drive market share. And that's really how we're looking at it. Because that's what the customer has voted on all year, and we feel like it's a strategy that's broad-based in the entire box. Certainly, there are some businesses that have more opportunities than others. But that's really how we came to this conclusion and the customer has been voting, and that's really what she's been voting on. And in terms of -- Matthew, in terms of the drivers, the categories, the ones that I said, cosmetics, home and Children's were really the best, Accessories was slightly above the chain and apparel trailed the chain. But again, it performed above our plan. And I think part of the things that really drove it was we had a big push this year in home on gifting, and we added some new classifications and the customer responded. Well, I think it's a positive buying environment. I mean there's still merchandise in the market. And I've said this on calls before, there are some vendors that are very aggressive in bringing in inventory as they're trying to gain market share and then others, it's more normalized. In terms of merchant margin, our strategy now is really to continue to offer the customer really great value because that is really, really what's working sharp prices. And so even if you're buying some of these really great opportunities, we are really thinking about passing along really that potential savings to the customer because we really do believe that is the best way to drive market -- to gain market share. And so that's really how we're approaching it at this point, and that is what the customer is responding to. Sure. In terms of categories for '24, I mean, with the brand strategy we're putting in place, I feel like there's -- it's pretty broad-based the opportunity. But obviously, our apparel business has been trailing the chain. And so we're focused on really trying to improve those assortments and to get the apparel business more in line with the other businesses. Sure. So from the merchandise strategy, we do expect it to accelerate as we go. Obviously, we've been building the strategy off of starting in Q2 of 2023. And now -- I would say now it's more broad-based than we were as we were coming across. Maybe the words I want to use is it's a little more intentional in certain businesses than it was before. And so we do expect that as we come across. We are expecting that our Apparel business as we move through the year will improve. And in terms of priorities, our priority this year is really to gain market share through a diligent execution of the strategy. We've done a lot of work around what we believe we need to do to gain market share. And so on the Ross side, that really is mine and our key priority. And then on the dd's side to go off and to do some additional work, to understand that customer. So as we go into newer markets, we satisfy her needs. It's -- the AUR fluctuates. It's based on the mix and the value of the goods that we're buying. So there's not a specific AUR pricing strategy. It's really a value strategy as we buy goods and put them at the sharpest price as we can to offer great value. So it's not like we're trying to hit a specific AUR or -- it could move as we go through the year and as we go through different closeouts, products and all of that, we're expecting it to move around. Whenever you're pricing goods, Marni, you're always doing what you're saying. You're looking at the product and you're looking at the value, right? So it doesn't necessarily always have to do with what you're paying for a product, right? The merchants are looking at it and saying this is the right value and they're doing it. I think the sharp pricing that we're talking about is really adding more brands at all 3 levels, good, better, best, assessing those brands and then putting them out at the values that the customers really responded to. So it's -- it's really built on the products themselves. \n I don't know how else to say that to you. We have the brands we want to have. We have [ visits and ] people who are growing. We've opened a lot of new resources this year. The merchants have been out really looking for new resources, looking to expand, looking to remix the products and labels themselves and then to put that mix out at sharp prices. So it's not like I'm looking to have x price point or x in each thing. It is really a value strategy, not a pricing strategy. It's a value strategy. Well, Beauty has so many components in there from a margin perspective. Overall, the beauty margins are fine or good. In every business we went in and looked at what our values were, what our brands were, what our product offerings were and we went in and said, some businesses we thought were on track and we're fine. In some businesses, we're learning we have more opportunity after what we've learned starting in Q2 all the way through Q3 and Q4 and building on that. So it's kind of an evolving process. But there's -- again, it's really a merchant-driven process and making sure that we put out the best possible value in the things that the customer wants and that we have the right brands, the right recognizable brands at each level; good, better and best. And in terms of the size of the merchant team, we have over 900 merchants. So every year, we -- every year, we promote people, move people. But in terms of saying, am I going out to take up the head count substantially? I think it's just -- I think it's more of a normal cadence that we would have. We feel like we have a pretty large team between the two companies. Krisztina, I'm not 100% sure what exactly -- what you're getting at exactly. Could you just say that again? So the first part in inventory, as Michael just said, we plan our inventory based off of sales and turn. And so -- and we build that by business, really bottom up, just in terms of pure inventory level and then we drive receipts. We have the inventory base we think we need and then we go to chase, and we drive the receipts, which drives the sales which drives the profits. That's from basic inventory. In terms of which categories, that's a merchant-driven strategy in terms of what businesses we're going to go after, where we see the opportunity in the outside world, where we know we can show great value and where we can add assortment. So there are kind of two different levels of thinking. And remember, it's a flexible business model. So if business really takes off and as we've started to beat our sales plans, we have the ability to take the inventory up or drive the inventory down because the model is flexible, the stores are flexible and the products are flexible. So we go -- we start in with our base plan and then again, build up for sales turn and then we go -- then we react to what the customer is telling us. So it's kind of fluid. I just think -- look, I just think there's market share to be had. I mean, more stores keep closing. I mean -- and there's just less places for consumers to shop and our job is to satisfy the customer. And if we do that, there are consumers out there for us to pick up and to expand. So we want to be able to satisfy our current customers and get her to come back more. We want to be able to add additional customers because as we know, as there have been many store closures over the last few years, that's also helped to fuel off-price. So as that continues, this is a focus for us. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "name": "Adam Orvos",
            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, comparable store sales rose a strong 7% for the quarter, entirely driven by higher traffic and shoppers positive response to our improved assortments throughout our stores.\n As Barbara noted earlier, fourth quarter operating margin of 12.4% was up 165 basis points from 10.7% in 2022 and included about an 80 basis point benefit from the 53rd week in 2023. Cost of goods sold as a percent of sales improved by 265 basis points versus last year, benefiting from a combination of factors. \n Merchandise gross margin increased by 110 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs. Distribution costs declined by 75 basis points partially driven by favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy costs levered by 75 and 45 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were buying costs that increased 40 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A for the period delevered by 100 basis points, mostly driven by higher incentive costs and wages. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for fiscal 2024. As mentioned in our press release, we are encouraged by the sustained sales momentum that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the holiday season. That said, there remains ongoing uncertainty in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environments. In addition, while inflation has moderated, prices for necessities like housing, food and gasoline remain elevated and continue to pressure the low to moderate income customers' discretionary spend. While we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to continue to take a conservative approach to forecasting our business in 2024. For the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, we are planning comparable store sales to increase 2% to 3% on top of a solid 5% gain in 2023. If sales perform in line with this plan, we expect earnings per share for 2024 to be in the range of $5.64 to $5.89 compared to $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 52-week year compared to 53 weeks in 2023. As previously mentioned, our 2023 earnings per share benefited from an additional $0.20 of EPS from the extra week. \n Turning to our guidance assumptions for the 2024 year. Total sales are planned to grow by 2% to 4% for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, versus the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This year-over-year increase in total revenue is affected by last year's 53rd week, which added approximately $308 million to sales in the fourth quarter and fiscal year of 2023. If same-store sales perform in line with our plan, operating margin for the full year is expected to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% compared to 11.3% last year, which benefited by 25 basis points from the 53rd week. This year-over-year change also includes the benefit of anniversarying higher incentive costs in 2023, given our outperformance. In addition, for fiscal 2024, we expect merchandise margins to be pressured as we plan to offer even more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that our customers expect from us. For 2024, we expect to open approximately 90 new locations, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's DISCOUNTS. These openings do not include our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. \n Net interest income is estimated to be $143 million. Depreciation amortization expense inclusive of stock-based amortization is forecast to be about $610 million for the year. The tax rate is projected to be about 24% to 25% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $332 million. In addition, capital expenditures for 2024 are planned to be approximately $840 million as we make further investments in our stores, supply chain and merchant processes to support our long-term growth and to increase efficiencies throughout the business. \n Let's turn now to our guidance for the first quarter. We are planning comparable store sales for the 13 weeks ending May 4, 2024, to be up 2% to 3% versus a 1% gain in last year's first quarter. If sales perform in line with this range, we expect earnings per share for the first quarter of 2024 to be $1.29 to $1.35 versus $1.09 last year. The operating statement assumptions that support our first quarter guidance include the following: total sales are planned to be up 6% to 8% versus last year's first quarter. We would then expect first quarter operating margin to be 11.1% to 11.4% compared to 10.1% last year. The expected increase mainly reflects our forecast for lower incentives and freight costs that are partially offset by lower merchandise margin and higher wages. We plan to add 18 new stores consisting of 11 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS during the period. Net interest income is estimated to be $44 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 25% and diluted shares are forecasted to be about $335 million. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. Yes. And on the flow-through question, this is Adam. Nothing has changed. We expect EBIT margin flow-through of about 10 to 15 basis points for each additional point of above-plan sales. And with our guide of plus 2% to 3%. And on a 52-week basis, you see margin rate expansion. We're getting some benefit also this year of lower incentive costs based on our outperformance from 2023. And Michael, on the 53rd week question, so we thought operating margin was worth 80 basis points in Q4 and about 25 for the year, and that was largely in gross margin versus SG&A. And Adrienne, on to your question on the components. Our 7% comp was all driven by traffic. Average basket was flat. So we had slightly higher AUR and slightly lower items per transaction. I would say it's somewhat stabilized, Brooke. Really where we're taking wage increases is where the -- where we're required to by the minimum wage changes state by state. I would say from an SG&A standpoint, we'll get the benefit of anniversarying the higher incentive costs. And then, we've generally been able to do a good job while the minimum wage changes are putting pressure in the stores. Through some of the efficiencies that we've invested in, we've generally been able to offset that. So I'm not seeing much overall pressure on the store side on that front. Ike, this is Adam. So on the ocean freight side, we'll get a little bit of benefit in Q1, but kind of negligible over the course of the year. Obviously, this is going to be dependent on how the situation plays out in the Suez Canal. And the duration of that conflict if anything changes. But I would also say that impacts a very small portion of our freight, yet we're closely monitoring that situation. On the domestic side, that's what Michael was commenting on earlier because fuel prices are lower than where they were at least this time last year. And based on our contracted rates, we should see some slight benefit throughout the year on the domestic side. We'll have to see how that conflict plays out is probably the biggest variable hike. We have a fairly good line of sight other than that variable that we can't control. Store closings. So we talked about -- Paul, we talked about 10 to 15 either relocated or closing stores, and we won't get into Ross versus dd's on that front. Laura, are you just talking about inventory levels at year-end? Is that your question?"
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Lorraine, then on just the other margin opportunities from a freight standpoint, from a domestic freight standpoint, we do expect to see some improvement for the full year, but to a lesser extent than we saw last year. It's Michael Hartshorn. Just on the customer overall. It's hard to see whether it's a new customer or the existing customer is spending more. What we did see is our performance, as we said in the commentary was broad-based across region, but it was broad-based really across all aspects of our business, including geographically, income levels and age. Just on -- I'll start with the Ross. The Ross new markets have been performing at or above our expectations. From a dd's standpoint, as we said in the commentary, the overall comp was just is slightly below Ross for both the quarter and the year. So while overall comps were respectable, we've been disappointed in the dd's new market performance. Our new markets tend to be more diverse based on ethnicity and income, and we clearly didn't satisfy them with the assortments we've been offering there. Chuck, on the shrink front, I would say we're not immune to the external theft and organized crime environment throughout retail. We do continue to invest in initiatives to hold shortage at bay. For 2023, our shrink levels were in line with 2022. Our guidance assumes that shrink is up a bit. So that's built into the guidance, but we'll continue to make investments there to keep it in line. Alex, it's Michael Hartshorn. On the long-term kind of what it's going to take to close the EBIT margin gap. Obviously, the biggest drivers are where wages and freight has been over the last couple of years. I would say over the long term, we can -- we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. As always, EBIT growth will be highly dependent on sustained strong sales growth. We believe the improvements we've made and continue to make to strengthen our value offerings will lead to market share gains in the long run. I'll also say we're investing in capabilities to drive efficiencies and related cost savings that we believe will contribute to profitability as well over time. As you can see in this year's guidance, our EBIT leverage is around 3% with double-digit EPS growth at the top end of that 2% to 3% range on a 52-week basis. Over the long term, we think we can get leverage in the 3% to 4% comp range. Adrienne, on dd's. So our real estate strategy for dd's is a little different than Ross. It's not as a clustered strategy, as you said, as we see for Ross. There is -- after you get outside of our core markets in Texas, Florida and California, they are, as I said, distinct ethnicity differences, which means we have to find the right assortment that's different from our core markets. We'll know more after we go through the customer research, and then we'll make -- start making the adjustments we think we need to improve performance there. In that one, I was talking about domestic freight, but I'll let Adam take it to speak on this. Simeon, on the trade down customer, we did -- I'll just repeat that for us, it's hard to see whether there's a trade down customer performance. Was broad-based, as we said, across geographies, but it was also broad-based across income levels. So hard to really tease out any impact to the trade down. On the transaction data, the comp was entirely driven by traffic or transactions for us. The average basket was flat as slightly higher average unit retails were offset by slightly lower units per transaction. And then on the weather front, it was neutral for us. Paul, I mean there are certain stores outside of our core markets, that's what I would say on number of stores. So you can see our store map. As far as Ross, Ross is performing fine in these markets. And it's really how they opened. Some of them are comping well, but they're comping off a low sales base. Nor have we decided yet. Usually, these are stores, I think, Paul, as you know, these are at the end of the lease term or starting a new option period where we'll make that judgment as we progress through the year. Aneesha, it's Michael. On both of those. So we typically don't talk about inter-quarter trends. I will say, on a stack basis, comps were the -- slightly stronger during the peak holiday period, holiday selling period. On the 4-wall margin, so the type of investments we're making in stores, we're making a number of investments to improve efficiencies in the stores. In many cases, that's just offsetting some of the minimum wage -- statutory minimum wage increases we've seen. Some of the things we're doing are technology investments for instance, we're piloting self-checkout in all stores. We don't ever think that that's going to be a full chain rollout, but we'll see how that goes. We've put in place more efficient handheld devices and it's used to check inventory, take markdowns, manage tasks and eventually even allow associate scheduling within the store, all drive efficiency that help us offset the rising minimum wages. Well, I mean there are things beyond that. This fiscal year, we have a number of rollouts. And as Adam said earlier, that's fully offsetting the minimum wage increase. And we continue to have new initiatives in the pipeline going forward. Staying on the store profile, I'll give you the easy answer on that one. No, we're not thinking of any changes to the store prototype as we move into '24. Dana, on the quarter overall, so we take puts and takes all the way November through December, we think the weather impact was neutral for us. It continues to be because the vast majority of the new stores are Ross. That said, the stores that we are opening for dd's, we expect them to be similar to historical sales levels because they're in the existing markets. But overall, 60% to 65% of a comp. So first on where else we're investing, about 40% of the capital this year is just expanded capacity. So we're opening a -- plan to open a new DC in early '25 in Arizona, and we have another one, a DC that we're going to start construction on later this year on our next distribution center. So 40% of that capital this year is on increased DC capacity. AI, I would say there's two parts of AI. We already use AI in some of the automated parts of our business. I think generative AI will be a journey for us like it is for others, but it is something we'll be looking at to find efficiencies in the business. Sure. First of all, our long-term store target hasn't changed, and that's 2,900 Ross Stores and 700 for dd's. I think you'd expect about 100 stores a year, depending on how the dd's plays out beyond this. But I think we're comfortable with the 75 Ross stores annually. That's a good fit for us, and we'll see where the dd's roll out after we get through our strategy. Well, there is -- I would say there's a lot of -- there's a lot of competition for our locations. But I'd say overall, we feel good about the real estate landscape and have a healthy pipeline. I would say post holiday for us is really a clearance period. So -- it is our lowest inventories of the year and it happens to be our lowest sales period. So we want to start off the year correctly. So it doesn't surprise me that it would feel that way if you're looking at the stores in January. I think as you progress through the spring, we manage our in-store inventories based on term, and we set it up. If we can beat the plan, then we can leverage markdowns. So that's the way we run the business, and we try to beat the turn from the previous year."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session.\n [Operator Instructions]\n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and fiscal 2023 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC.\n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that both sales and earnings outperformed our expectations for the quarter as customers responded favorably to the terrific values we offer throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 11.2%, up from 9.8% last year. Leverage from the same-store sales gain and lower freight costs were partially offset by higher incentives and store wages.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, were $1.33 compared to earnings per share of $1 last year. Net income for the period rose to $447 million versus $342 million in the prior year period. Total sales for the quarter were $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion last year, with the comparable store sales gain of 5%. \n For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.74 on net earnings of $1.3 billion compared to $3.08 per share on net income of $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $14.4 billion with comparable store sales up 4% over last year. For the third quarter at Ross, cosmetic, accessories and shoes were again the strongest performing businesses, while geographic results were broad-based.\n Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS shoppers also responded favorably to its strong value offerings, driving improved sales trends during the quarter. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 5% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 2%. Packaway merchandise represented 39% of total inventories versus 41% in the same period of the prior year.\n During the third quarter, we also completed our expansion program for 2023 with the addition of 43 new Ross and 8 dd's discounts. Over the year, we added a total of 97 locations comprised of 72 Ross and 25 dd's. We now expect to end the year with 1,764 Ross stores and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS for a net increase of 94 stores.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher traffic. Operating margin increased 135 basis points to 11.2%. Cost of goods sold improved by 260 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin was the main driver with a 235-basis point increase, primarily from lower ocean freight costs.\n Distribution expenses improved by 45 basis points, mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy levered by 40 and 25 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher buying costs that increased 85 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A costs for the period increased by 125 basis points, primarily driven by higher incentive costs and store wages.\n During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $239 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to face macroeconomic volatility, persistent inflation and more recently, geopolitical uncertainty. In addition, we are up against our most difficult quarterly sales comparisons versus 2022 in the fourth quarter. As a result and while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious approach in forecasting our business and reiterating our prior sales guidance for the fourth quarter.\n For the 13 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we continue to plan same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are projected to be in the range of $1.56 to $1.62 compared to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the third quarter.\n Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter forecast, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are now expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.36 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year is an estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.\n The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 8% to 10%, including an estimated $260 million benefit from the 53rd week. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5% versus 10.7% last year. This range includes a 65-basis point benefit from the extra week. We are planning for higher merchandise margins, given lower ocean freight cost, though moderating from the improvement earlier this year.\n In addition, lower domestic freight and distribution costs, partially due to favorable packaway timing are expected to benefit margin. Partially offsetting these lower costs are forecast for higher incentive compensation. Net interest income is estimated to be about $45 million as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on our cash balance. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 335 million.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. Looking ahead, despite all the challenges in the external environment, we are encouraged by our healthy above-plan results to date this year. We also remain confident in the resilience of the off-price sector and our ability to operate successfully within it, especially given consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience. As a result, we remain optimistic about the company's future prospects and our ability to expand market share and profitability over time.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on another nice quarter. So Barbara, could you elaborate on changes across categories that you've made to increase your value focus? It seems like that was a clear takeaway from your comments. Maybe also if you could speak to the cadence of traffic that you saw as the third quarter progressed? And just how you see your assortments positioned in the holiday to take share. \nMichael Hartshorn: Matthew, I'll start with the traffic. As we said in the commentary, traffic was the primary driver of comp for the quarter on a stack basis. The comps were fairly consistent across the quarter with a couple of fits and starts late in the quarter regionally with weather as it always is this time of year. That said, for the entire quarter, weather was neutral. \nBarbara Rentler: And Matt, by change across categories, do you mean performance? \nMatthew Boss: More the value -- I think you talked about a greater value focus starting in the second quarter. It sounds like it resonated further in the third quarter. So just maybe changes that you've made as it relates to that. \nBarbara Rentler: Well, the value changes that we made are across the entire box. So the merchants are out there really looking for great branded products where they can offer compelling values. So that's really -- it's not in any one area. It's across the box. Obviously, some businesses are further along than others as you would expect. But that's a company-wide focus now to offer the most compelling value to the customer at this time. And changes to the assortment of the fourth quarter or just share is really after gifting. We've expanded some of our products in gifting categories, which I wouldn't talk about on the call but it's really a focus on gifting. \nMatthew Boss: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, Adam, how best to think about merchandise margin recapture opportunity in the fourth quarter just given the environment a year ago? And any change in terms of flow-through in the model on 3% to 4% same-store sales as we think more multiyear. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. On the latter part, no change in the flow through in the model, right? We still expect to lever on the 3% to 4% comp. And your question on merchandise margin was fourth quarter specific? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. So ocean freight, which we benefited from all year, will still be a benefit in the fourth quarter. But as we said in the call comments, we'll moderate considerably. We started to see pretty significant rate reductions about this time last year. So there'll be further benefit in fourth quarter, but not like we have seen in the first 3 quarters of the year. I would expect that really to be the main driver on merchandise margin. All other components should be pretty consistent with last year. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Great. I guess, first, your plan for the fourth quarter top line hasn't really changed despite comps exceeding the high end of your plan by a couple of hundred basis points in the third quarter. Curious, does that give you more confidence in the upside case? Or are there things you've seen in recent trends that would suggest a more material quarter-over-quarter deceleration is the right expectation? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's Michael again. I would say, for the most part, it's -- there's a lot going on in the external environment, whether it's a macro economy. We expect it to be a very promotional retail environment and now you have geopolitics into the mix, and it is our toughest compare for the year. So given everything going on externally, we think it's prudent to remain very conservative in running the business in the fourth quarter. \nMark Altschwager: And maybe a follow-up for Barbara. The North American wholesale channel continues to be challenging for many vendors, given the dynamic macro. I'm curious what you're hearing with respect to product availability heading into calendar '24? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, currently, there's a lot of availability in the market, as I know you know that. Here's a look at availability at this point. Vendors -- in this environment, vendors are really looking for ways to increase their market share. And so they've shifted some of their business towards the growing retail channels. So if, in fact, they get less bookings, we talked about them having less bookings for fall and there's still availability. So bookings are one thing.  Then how much they decide to bring in to drive market share or to shift channels is an other things.\n So I don't necessarily think they're the -- you can judge just by bookings what they say about their bookings. And therefore, frankly, there are some vendors that are really looking to gain market share in this period in time and are taking greater risk on bringing in more goods. So it's kind of a mixed bag but they're really looking to expand who they do business with and to shift channels. So I think that's the reason why goods continue to become available. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Sorry if I missed it, but could you talk about performance in the home category? And then also I was curious about store performance based on income, demographic, locations. Any change in terms of how any specific income cohort behaved during the quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, on the income, as we said in the commentary, the comp performance was fairly broad-based across geographies, but also what I'd say is trade area demographics, including income. So your bigger question is, are you seeing a trade down? We saw very broad-based performance across income levels. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the home performance, home performed slightly below the chain average. \nPaul Lejuez: Got it. And then just a follow-up. On the merch margin, I think you mentioned freight is a big driver but can you talk about pure merch margin outside of freight? Just IMUs, markdowns, what the out-the-door merch margin was on a pure product basis? \nAdam Orvos: Yes, Paul. I won't go through a component by component but merch margin in addition to the ocean freight benefit, but if you back ocean freight out of it, we were better than last year as we anniversary the markdowns that we took last year. So third quarter last year was kind of our peak quarter for incremental markdowns last year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: What were the drivers of dd's improved sales trends during the quarter? And is that now running in line with Ross? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Lorraine. As -- dd's, as we said, also improved and were relatively in line with performance at Ross. We believe the improved performance here like it is at Ross is the customers responding to the broad assortment of values throughout the stores. And I'd also add easing inflation certainly doesn't hurt this customer. \nLorraine Maikis: And then any update on shrink from your recent physical inventory? \nAdam Orvos: Yes. Lorraine, in third quarter -- so we took our second physical inventory over the year in third quarter and trued up those results, the results were in line with our expectations and in line with last year. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. \nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Nice job in 3Q. Barbara, your buyers are obviously doing a great job passing on value to the consumer. I'm wondering how initial markup trends are as we -- as you focus on value? \nBarbara Rentler: Well, obviously, we're not going to talk about but IMU. But I think as the merchants are in the market and they are really looking for compelling deals, they obviously have metrics that they should hit, and I would say that they do that. But if there's a really unbelievable deal, we're going to price it the way we think we need to price it. Our strategy now is really to continue to deliver value. And so again, they have metrics, everyone is hitting their metrics, but that's the focus. What is the right price, what is the right value to drive the customer into the store to gain market share. So that's the hit that everyone does. \nJohn Kernan: Understood. And Adam, when you look at the model, what do you think is the line item in either COGS or SG&A that has the most potential for improvement if you maintain the 3% to 4% same-store sales going forward? \nAdam Orvos: We're just getting into the -- we're working our way through the planning process. We'll come back and talk at the end of the year and kind of frame up how we see the go forward at that point in time. I think just to give you some generalities, I feel like we've recaptured most of the ocean freight at this point. When we look at container rates now are very similar to where they were in 2019. So we think by the end of the year, we'll capture all that benefit.\n On the domestic side of freight, we've recaptured some but certainly not at 2019 levels, given the elevated fuel cost and elevated driver wages since 2019. So pushing very hard on the other components. We'll come back and tell you more about the puts and takes at the end of the year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Congratulation. Can you provide color on the trend of basket size and the composition between AUR and UPT this quarter and if you see that changing going forward over the next few quarters? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. And as we said, traffic was the primary driver of the 5% comp. Average basket was up just slightly as an increase in the units per transaction was partially offset by slightly lower average unit retails. And if we think about it going forward, we'd like to be driven by traffic but we don't plan our business around the components. We plan the business on offering the best value. And if we get traffic and a basket size increase, that's great for the business. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: I was hoping you could discuss the puts and takes behind your SG&A growth now that we've moved through the periods of elevated incentive comp investment this summer. How should we be thinking about the growth of that line item going forward? And in particular, can you elaborate on what you're seeing in terms of store wage rate inflation? \nAdam Orvos: Brooke, this is Adam. Yes. So store wage, as we said in the comments, they'll continue to put pressure on us. That's largely driven by minimum wage changes that we need to take in the marketplace. But I would say overall on SG&A, the biggest moving part this year has been incentive comp, right? So as you'll remember, very little incentive comp last year. And not only did we have to reset the bar this year but we're obviously outperforming our financial plan. So that's the biggest kind of volatility in the SG&A line. \nMichael Hartshorn: I'll just add on the wage front. I mean, generally speaking, wages have stabilized throughout the stores and the DCs and any increases we're seeing are really driven by minimum wages. On SG&A going forward, I think we'd expect that we'd be able to lever between the 3 and 4 comp as we have in the past. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter. I just want to ask, do you think -- Michael or Adam, jump ball, what do you think about -- what do you look at today to inform us whether there's some opportunity in the pure merch margin for next year, puts and takes that you're thinking about?\n Barbara, you mentioned seeing some -- you mentioned some great comments on some of the brand availability. Is there an opportunity for AUR as you guys get better access to quality brands? And then I noticed you opened a bunch of the handful stores in Michigan a few months ago and 1 single store in Minnesota. These are new markets, even though we've heard you guys talk so favorably about how the Midwest has gone since you launched it maybe 12 years ago. It Seems like you're starting to move into some new markets, some fairly big ones, maybe just some thoughts around the new market strategy. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On merchant margin for next year, we're in the middle of our planning process now. So I'd wait until our year-end call, and we can give you some more feedback on that. As you mentioned, we entered Michigan and Minnesota during the third quarter. It's very early on those. So hard to comment at this stage other than we're very optimistic about our new market growth.. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of brands and AUR increase. Really, I know it sounds like I'm going back to same thing. We really are looking at every deal based on the value we put out on the floor. And so obviously, if they're higher on brand, those goods would -- even at great values would have higher AUR. But it's really a mix of all brands, whether they're moderate, they're better, they're good, better, best, where they're best. That's how we're really approaching it in terms of just saying I'm going to raise the AUR because we increased we [ debt ] in total. That's not how we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it more holistically, and that's the piece that customers responding to. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great. And I'll add my congratulations. Barbara, I often -- I am on the topic of your packaway and your short stay. Historically, when we have sort of disruptive weather and kind of like the unseasonable weather in the early in the quarter, you're able to use your short-stay flexibility to kind of pace into that. I'm just wondering how advantageous has that been this season? Or is the macro -- kind of more challenging macro sort of overwhelming that? \nBarbara Rentler: I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying. You're saying that did we get seasonal products early and [indiscernible] closing the fourth quarter? \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes, yes. I think it's more that weather has not transitioned to cold for any long permanent period of time, so we're hearing frontline retailers talk about that lower their fourth quarters, and there's a disconnect between how much they've ordered and what things that they need to get rid of. So I'm wondering if that's been a benefit to you. \nBarbara Rentler: At this point in time, there's -- the goods are obviously building because the weather has been warmer than people anticipated. But there is a moment in time when vendors decide to really move the goods and that really -- becomes really more longer-term packaway. So if you're thinking outerwears, whether its classifications like that, that really would be longer term versus shorter term deals.\n I could still get deals in front of us. But really, that's really more of a longer-term play that vendors at the end of the year decided what they want to do when they're figuring out what they're going to buy for the next year. So short term, I think people are just coming to -- having a reality check of where they are with some of those classifications of products. So the real answer, I guess, is more news to follow. But at this moment in time, it hasn't been -- they haven't had a big movement if that's what you're looking for, a big movement on the... \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Starton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: Great. Maybe for Barbara, some peers have highlighted opportunities in new or adjacent categories. So I'm just wondering, has Ross entered any newer categories recently? Or what kind of thoughts do you have on opportunities in general and then any changes in category mix shift that you guys have done? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Yes, we have entered into some new categories. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about it on the call. But yes, for the fourth quarter, we entered some different categories for gifting, which are going on the floor now and into December. And then just opportunities in general as we move into next year. I think we have some opportunities in expanding certain businesses and then also coming back into some businesses that we exited, I would say, sometime during COVID.\n So I think there is an opportunity for us to have more newness on the floor, which is really what the customer  love plus value is really what the customers responding to. So every year, we go in and look and say, what else can we expand, what else can we do? But this year, we have, yes, we have our categories in mind if [ we were ] not in mind and where we are going to [ spring ]. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Congratulations. And if I forget, best of luck for the holiday season. But I'm curious, just on dd's, if we can dig in a little bit there. Are you -- with people looking to trade down with their wallets a little tighter, are you finding that you are attracting more new customers into that brand and the traffic trends that drove the comp in the quarter, whether this -- was that also true for dd's? And then I recall dd's tends to have more -- a little bit more family focused, you tended to have a little bit more kids and toy focus even. I'm curious how you feel about the lead-up to holiday with the assortments and values there? And is that still the case in dd's actually? \nMichael Hartshorn: Marni, on traffic. So traffic like Ross, the comp for dd's was entirely driven by traffic. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of assortment, yes, it is a family-focused box and the dd's customer does have more children. So businesses like toys in the fourth quarter becomes very important [ for the toys ]. \nMarni Shapiro: Also holiday dresses do you do that business as well in dd's ? \nBarbara Rentler: We do all those businesses. All the traditional businesses you would expect, you would expect holiday dresses, you would expect toys, you expect anything, also family photo shoots and then toys or other little things that they give  to kids but... \nMarni Shapiro: And can I just ask a follow-up on that? Are you seeing at dd's that the customer is now coming to dd's for these big holiday events like for Halloween, for Christmas? Does that customer come to dd's more regularly? Is it part of their  regular trip of stores to go to? \nBarbara Rentler: I think it's part of the regular stores to go to. And do they like seasonal products, Halloween harvest, Christmas. Obviously, Christmas is very big. Yes. dd's, I don't think they'll get up in the morning and say, I need to go buy some Halloweens. I think there is always  [indiscernible] they're going to stores, they are seeing things that they like and I think it's simple purchases probably for everyone. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: Congratulations on the nice results. Can you give some color on the regional performance and what you saw California, maybe Texas and any of the other areas? And then also on categories, I think last time -- on last quarter's call, you mentioned that apparel trailed but improved sequentially. What did you see this quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: Regionally, Dana, our largest markets, California was above the chain average. Texas and Florida were in line. And as we mentioned on the call, it was very broad-based across the country. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of apparel, it's slightly trailed the chain average and the comps were relatively similar between Q2 and Q3, but they did exceed plan. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: So Barbara, as retailers and brands have been talking about clearing excess stock. Are you seeing any change in your inventory mix and your percent of closeout? Like through the year, are you seeing more importing and more upfront buying? And I have a quick follow-up for Adam. You mentioned labor costs and wages stabilizing. Can you talk about some of the new labor cost saving models you've been piloting like self-checkout and any updates you can share on the rollout of those? \nMichael Hartshorn: On the self-checkout, we're in a very small number of stores. And as you can imagine, we're going very slowly to make sure we get it right. We're in about 100 stores right now, and we're going to continue to pilot the operating model that we have there, and we're very cognizant of the shrink environment, so we're going to go slow. \nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of upfront versus closeouts, as the year progressed, I mean it's pretty similar. It can peak up and down a little bit in the fourth quarter. You have more home business, some of that's more DI, so that gets bigger versus the rest of the year. But I would say it's similar. I think closeouts have come across all year pretty much in most businesses. And so I think -- yes, I don't see a bigger shift. It could have gone up or down 2 or 3 points, but nothing major. \nAdam Orvos: And Aneesha, just building on those comments, within our CapEx, we're definitely investing in technology, more automation in our distribution centers. We're spending money in our stores just to automate. A lot of our noncustomer-facing tasks in more efficient ways to take markdowns and check inventory and also just investing in more analytics in the business. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Great. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you saw in footwear? I'm not sure if you did highlight it or if I missed it, but it would be great to get color there. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Shoes, again, was one of our best-performing businesses. And that was pretty -- that was broad-based across all the shoes. \nCorey Tarlowe: Got it. And then just as it relates to higher buying costs, I believe you highlighted. Could you discuss what drove that? \nAdam Orvos: The higher buying was all incentive cost related. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets. \nLaura Champine: It's really about California wage rates, not just with the minimum wage increase but also the fast-food wage increase slated for the new year. How much of that -- how much of a material impact do you think that might have on your expense lines for next year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Laura, obviously, we've been tracking up in California for some time with their minimum increases there. It's been a competitive market for us for a long time. I think in regards to the fast-food workers, we'll have to see how that spills over, but we believe we recruit from a different pool than the fast-food industry. \nLaura Champine: That's helpful. If I could get a clarification of a general sense of what percentage of your employees -- of your store-level employees are in California? Will that line up with your store count? \nMichael Hartshorn: It will be a little higher than our store count because those tend to be higher-volume stores but slightly above our store count, I would say. \nOperator: And the last question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. \nArian Razai: This is Arian Razai on for Bob. It looks like inventories are up 5 -- on a 5% comp increase. Could you please expand on packaways, given the great brand availability, the reason of packaways have been trending down a couple of percentage points below last year and every quarter this year? Any changes in approach, a factor of higher deployment of product? Is it like better inventory productivity at stores? Any additional color would be super helpful. \nBarbara Rentler: Really no change to how we're running packaway. Sometimes when your business is very good, and we've been chasing a lot of business this year [indiscernible]. So we've been in a constant chase. And the thing about packaways, when you're buying goods that you're going to hold, you have to be absolutely sure that the values are correct. So the merchants are very discerning in what they buy when they put in packaway because when you're bringing it back out, we want to make sure that the value is right.\n So I don't think there's any way to look at packaway, there's a lot of goods out there. It could be packaway, just put more goods into our packaway we could. I think it's a merchant's job to really put the best product in there at the best possible values, and we're focused -- very focused on value. And so I don't think there's anything to read into it. But We feel -- actually, we feel very good about our content in the packaway that we own this shift because there's been a lot of very good deals and a lot of good products out there.\n So we have plenty of money to buy packaway if we'd like to buy some, but that is really comes to the merchant team. It's their call on what they believe is the right value. And then that's why, therefore, can fluctuate that plus the chase that we had in sales in the quarter. \nArian Razai: Got it. Got it. So would you say that the product this year resonates better with the consumer like from the value perspective? \nBarbara Rentler: You mean the packaway product or just products in general? \nArian Razai: Just products in general. \nBarbara Rentler: I think the customer is really responding to the better values. Clearly, she's financially pressed. And even though inflation is easing, she's still under pressure. And so whenever you can give the customer a better branded bargain at an unbelievable value, she's going to respond, which is why we're highly focused on that, and that would therefore take us through stronger market share. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to pass the call back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Happy holidays. \nOperator: And this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our third quarter performance followed by an update on our outlook for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have.\n As noted in today's press release, we are pleased that both sales and earnings outperformed our expectations for the quarter as customers responded favorably to the terrific values we offer throughout our stores. Operating margin for the period was 11.2%, up from 9.8% last year. Leverage from the same-store sales gain and lower freight costs were partially offset by higher incentives and store wages.\n Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, were $1.33 compared to earnings per share of $1 last year. Net income for the period rose to $447 million versus $342 million in the prior year period. Total sales for the quarter were $4.9 billion, up from $4.6 billion last year, with the comparable store sales gain of 5%. \n For the first 9 months, earnings per share were $3.74 on net earnings of $1.3 billion compared to $3.08 per share on net income of $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $14.4 billion with comparable store sales up 4% over last year. For the third quarter at Ross, cosmetic, accessories and shoes were again the strongest performing businesses, while geographic results were broad-based.\n Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS shoppers also responded favorably to its strong value offerings, driving improved sales trends during the quarter. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 5% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 2%. Packaway merchandise represented 39% of total inventories versus 41% in the same period of the prior year.\n During the third quarter, we also completed our expansion program for 2023 with the addition of 43 new Ross and 8 dd's discounts. Over the year, we added a total of 97 locations comprised of 72 Ross and 25 dd's. We now expect to end the year with 1,764 Ross stores and 345 dd's DISCOUNTS for a net increase of 94 stores.\n Now Adam will provide further details on our third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance. Thank you, Adam. Looking ahead, despite all the challenges in the external environment, we are encouraged by our healthy above-plan results to date this year. We also remain confident in the resilience of the off-price sector and our ability to operate successfully within it, especially given consumers' heightened focus on value and convenience. As a result, we remain optimistic about the company's future prospects and our ability to expand market share and profitability over time.\n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. And Matt, by change across categories, do you mean performance? Well, the value changes that we made are across the entire box. So the merchants are out there really looking for great branded products where they can offer compelling values. So that's really -- it's not in any one area. It's across the box. Obviously, some businesses are further along than others as you would expect. But that's a company-wide focus now to offer the most compelling value to the customer at this time. And changes to the assortment of the fourth quarter or just share is really after gifting. We've expanded some of our products in gifting categories, which I wouldn't talk about on the call but it's really a focus on gifting. Well, currently, there's a lot of availability in the market, as I know you know that. Here's a look at availability at this point. Vendors -- in this environment, vendors are really looking for ways to increase their market share. And so they've shifted some of their business towards the growing retail channels. So if, in fact, they get less bookings, we talked about them having less bookings for fall and there's still availability. So bookings are one thing.  Then how much they decide to bring in to drive market share or to shift channels is an other things.\n So I don't necessarily think they're the -- you can judge just by bookings what they say about their bookings. And therefore, frankly, there are some vendors that are really looking to gain market share in this period in time and are taking greater risk on bringing in more goods. So it's kind of a mixed bag but they're really looking to expand who they do business with and to shift channels. So I think that's the reason why goods continue to become available. And in terms of the home performance, home performed slightly below the chain average. Well, obviously, we're not going to talk about but IMU. But I think as the merchants are in the market and they are really looking for compelling deals, they obviously have metrics that they should hit, and I would say that they do that. But if there's a really unbelievable deal, we're going to price it the way we think we need to price it. Our strategy now is really to continue to deliver value. And so again, they have metrics, everyone is hitting their metrics, but that's the focus. What is the right price, what is the right value to drive the customer into the store to gain market share. So that's the hit that everyone does. And in terms of brands and AUR increase. Really, I know it sounds like I'm going back to same thing. We really are looking at every deal based on the value we put out on the floor. And so obviously, if they're higher on brand, those goods would -- even at great values would have higher AUR. But it's really a mix of all brands, whether they're moderate, they're better, they're good, better, best, where they're best. That's how we're really approaching it in terms of just saying I'm going to raise the AUR because we increased we [ debt ] in total. That's not how we're thinking about it. We're thinking about it more holistically, and that's the piece that customers responding to. I just want to make sure I understand what you're saying. You're saying that did we get seasonal products early and [indiscernible] closing the fourth quarter? At this point in time, there's -- the goods are obviously building because the weather has been warmer than people anticipated. But there is a moment in time when vendors decide to really move the goods and that really -- becomes really more longer-term packaway. So if you're thinking outerwears, whether its classifications like that, that really would be longer term versus shorter term deals.\n I could still get deals in front of us. But really, that's really more of a longer-term play that vendors at the end of the year decided what they want to do when they're figuring out what they're going to buy for the next year. So short term, I think people are just coming to -- having a reality check of where they are with some of those classifications of products. So the real answer, I guess, is more news to follow. But at this moment in time, it hasn't been -- they haven't had a big movement if that's what you're looking for, a big movement on the... Sure. Yes, we have entered into some new categories. Obviously, I'm not going to talk about it on the call. But yes, for the fourth quarter, we entered some different categories for gifting, which are going on the floor now and into December. And then just opportunities in general as we move into next year. I think we have some opportunities in expanding certain businesses and then also coming back into some businesses that we exited, I would say, sometime during COVID.\n So I think there is an opportunity for us to have more newness on the floor, which is really what the customer  love plus value is really what the customers responding to. So every year, we go in and look and say, what else can we expand, what else can we do? But this year, we have, yes, we have our categories in mind if [ we were ] not in mind and where we are going to [ spring ]. And then in terms of assortment, yes, it is a family-focused box and the dd's customer does have more children. So businesses like toys in the fourth quarter becomes very important [ for the toys ]. We do all those businesses. All the traditional businesses you would expect, you would expect holiday dresses, you would expect toys, you expect anything, also family photo shoots and then toys or other little things that they give  to kids but... I think it's part of the regular stores to go to. And do they like seasonal products, Halloween harvest, Christmas. Obviously, Christmas is very big. Yes. dd's, I don't think they'll get up in the morning and say, I need to go buy some Halloweens. I think there is always  [indiscernible] they're going to stores, they are seeing things that they like and I think it's simple purchases probably for everyone. And then in terms of apparel, it's slightly trailed the chain average and the comps were relatively similar between Q2 and Q3, but they did exceed plan. And then in terms of upfront versus closeouts, as the year progressed, I mean it's pretty similar. It can peak up and down a little bit in the fourth quarter. You have more home business, some of that's more DI, so that gets bigger versus the rest of the year. But I would say it's similar. I think closeouts have come across all year pretty much in most businesses. And so I think -- yes, I don't see a bigger shift. It could have gone up or down 2 or 3 points, but nothing major. Sure. Shoes, again, was one of our best-performing businesses. And that was pretty -- that was broad-based across all the shoes. Really no change to how we're running packaway. Sometimes when your business is very good, and we've been chasing a lot of business this year [indiscernible]. So we've been in a constant chase. And the thing about packaways, when you're buying goods that you're going to hold, you have to be absolutely sure that the values are correct.

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher traffic. Operating margin increased 135 basis points to 11.2%. Cost of goods sold improved by 260 basis points in the quarter. Merchandise margin was the main driver with a 235-basis point increase, primarily from lower ocean freight costs.\n Distribution expenses improved by 45 basis points, mainly due to favorable timing of packaway-related costs. Domestic freight and occupancy levered by 40 and 25 basis points, respectively. Partially offsetting these benefits were higher buying costs that increased 85 basis points, mainly from higher incentives. SG&A costs for the period increased by 125 basis points, primarily driven by higher incentive costs and store wages.\n During the third quarter, we repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $239 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year.\n Now let's discuss our fourth quarter guidance. We continue to face macroeconomic volatility, persistent inflation and more recently, geopolitical uncertainty. In addition, we are up against our most difficult quarterly sales comparisons versus 2022 in the fourth quarter. As a result and while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a cautious approach in forecasting our business and reiterating our prior sales guidance for the fourth quarter.\n For the 13 weeks ending January 27, 2024, we continue to plan same-store sales to be up 1% to 2%. Earnings per share for the 14 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are projected to be in the range of $1.56 to $1.62 compared to $1.31 in the fourth quarter of 2022. This guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the third quarter.\n Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth quarter forecast, earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, are now expected to be in the range of $5.30 to $5.36 versus $4.38 last year. Incorporated in this guidance for both the fourth quarter and full year is an estimated earnings per share benefit of $0.16 from the 53rd week in fiscal 2023.\n The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth quarter guidance include the following: Total sales are projected to grow 8% to 10%, including an estimated $260 million benefit from the 53rd week. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.3% to 11.5% versus 10.7% last year. This range includes a 65-basis point benefit from the extra week. We are planning for higher merchandise margins, given lower ocean freight cost, though moderating from the improvement earlier this year.\n In addition, lower domestic freight and distribution costs, partially due to favorable packaway timing are expected to benefit margin. Partially offsetting these lower costs are forecast for higher incentive compensation. Net interest income is estimated to be about $45 million as we continue to benefit from higher interest rates on our cash balance. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% to 24%, and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 335 million.\n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. Yes. On the latter part, no change in the flow through in the model, right? We still expect to lever on the 3% to 4% comp. And your question on merchandise margin was fourth quarter specific? Yes. So ocean freight, which we benefited from all year, will still be a benefit in the fourth quarter. But as we said in the call comments, we'll moderate considerably. We started to see pretty significant rate reductions about this time last year. So there'll be further benefit in fourth quarter, but not like we have seen in the first 3 quarters of the year. I would expect that really to be the main driver on merchandise margin. All other components should be pretty consistent with last year. Yes, Paul. I won't go through a component by component but merch margin in addition to the ocean freight benefit, but if you back ocean freight out of it, we were better than last year as we anniversary the markdowns that we took last year. So third quarter last year was kind of our peak quarter for incremental markdowns last year. Yes. Lorraine, in third quarter -- so we took our second physical inventory over the year in third quarter and trued up those results, the results were in line with our expectations and in line with last year. We're just getting into the -- we're working our way through the planning process. We'll come back and talk at the end of the year and kind of frame up how we see the go forward at that point in time. I think just to give you some generalities, I feel like we've recaptured most of the ocean freight at this point. When we look at container rates now are very similar to where they were in 2019. So we think by the end of the year, we'll capture all that benefit.\n On the domestic side of freight, we've recaptured some but certainly not at 2019 levels, given the elevated fuel cost and elevated driver wages since 2019. So pushing very hard on the other components. We'll come back and tell you more about the puts and takes at the end of the year. Brooke, this is Adam. Yes. So store wage, as we said in the comments, they'll continue to put pressure on us. That's largely driven by minimum wage changes that we need to take in the marketplace. But I would say overall on SG&A, the biggest moving part this year has been incentive comp, right? So as you'll remember, very little incentive comp last year. And not only did we have to reset the bar this year but we're obviously outperforming our financial plan. So that's the biggest kind of volatility in the SG&A line. And Aneesha, just building on those comments, within our CapEx, we're definitely investing in technology, more automation in our distribution centers. We're spending money in our stores just to automate. A lot of our noncustomer-facing tasks in more efficient ways to take markdowns and check inventory and also just investing in more analytics in the business. The higher buying was all incentive cost related."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Matthew, I'll start with the traffic. As we said in the commentary, traffic was the primary driver of comp for the quarter on a stack basis. The comps were fairly consistent across the quarter with a couple of fits and starts late in the quarter regionally with weather as it always is this time of year. That said, for the entire quarter, weather was neutral. Yes. It's Michael again. I would say, for the most part, it's -- there's a lot going on in the external environment, whether it's a macro economy. We expect it to be a very promotional retail environment and now you have geopolitics into the mix, and it is our toughest compare for the year. So given everything going on externally, we think it's prudent to remain very conservative in running the business in the fourth quarter. Paul, on the income, as we said in the commentary, the comp performance was fairly broad-based across geographies, but also what I'd say is trade area demographics, including income. So your bigger question is, are you seeing a trade down? We saw very broad-based performance across income levels. Sure, Lorraine. As -- dd's, as we said, also improved and were relatively in line with performance at Ross. We believe the improved performance here like it is at Ross is the customers responding to the broad assortment of values throughout the stores. And I'd also add easing inflation certainly doesn't hurt this customer. Sure. And as we said, traffic was the primary driver of the 5% comp. Average basket was up just slightly as an increase in the units per transaction was partially offset by slightly lower average unit retails. And if we think about it going forward, we'd like to be driven by traffic but we don't plan our business around the components. We plan the business on offering the best value. And if we get traffic and a basket size increase, that's great for the business. I'll just add on the wage front. I mean, generally speaking, wages have stabilized throughout the stores and the DCs and any increases we're seeing are really driven by minimum wages. On SG&A going forward, I think we'd expect that we'd be able to lever between the 3 and 4 comp as we have in the past. Sure. On merchant margin for next year, we're in the middle of our planning process now. So I'd wait until our year-end call, and we can give you some more feedback on that. As you mentioned, we entered Michigan and Minnesota during the third quarter. It's very early on those. So hard to comment at this stage other than we're very optimistic about our new market growth.. Marni, on traffic. So traffic like Ross, the comp for dd's was entirely driven by traffic. Regionally, Dana, our largest markets, California was above the chain average. Texas and Florida were in line. And as we mentioned on the call, it was very broad-based across the country. On the self-checkout, we're in a very small number of stores. And as you can imagine, we're going very slowly to make sure we get it right. We're in about 100 stores right now, and we're going to continue to pilot the operating model that we have there, and we're very cognizant of the shrink environment, so we're going to go slow. Laura, obviously, we've been tracking up in California for some time with their minimum increases there. It's been a competitive market for us for a long time. I think in regards to the fast-food workers, we'll have to see how that spills over, but we believe we recruit from a different pool than the fast-food industry. It will be a little higher than our store count because those tend to be higher-volume stores but slightly above our store count, I would say."

[Operator Instructions] \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2022 Form 10-K and fiscal 2023 Form 8-Ks on the file with the SEC. \n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. \n Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2023 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, despite continued inflationary pressures impacting our low to moderate income customers, first quarter sales were relatively in line with our expectations. Total sales of $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 1%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023, are $1.09 on net income of $371 million. These results compare to $0.97 per share on net earnings of $338 million for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022. \n Cosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter continued to trail Ross, reflecting the aforementioned inflationary pressures that continues to have a larger impact on our lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 16% versus last year. Average store inventories were up 2% at the end of the quarter. Packaway merchandise represented 42% of total inventories versus 43% last year.\n Turning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 100 new stores this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. \n Now, Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. \n As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 1% for the quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. First quarter operating margin of 10.1% was down from 10.8% in 2022. As expected, this decline primarily reflects higher incentive compensation versus last year when we underperformed our expectations. \n Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs, while domestic freight costs declined by 60 basis points. \n Partially offsetting these 2 favorable items were higher distribution expenses of 65 basis points, driven primarily by unfavorable packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center. Buying increased by 60 basis points due to higher incentive compensation and occupancy deleveraged 5 basis points. \n SG&A for the period rose 115 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive compensation and store wages versus last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $234 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. \n For the 13 weeks ending July 29, 2023, comparable sales are forecast to be relatively flat. Second quarter 2023 earnings per share are projected to be $1.07 to $1.14 versus $1.11 for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022. \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2023 include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 27 locations in the second quarter, including 18 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 9.8% to 10.1% range, down from 11.3% in 2022 as higher merchandise margin from lower ocean freight cost is forecast to be offset by an increase in expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. \n We expect net interest income to be approximately $31 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 339 million. \n Now turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and guidance for the second quarter, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are still planned to be relatively flat. We now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, to be $4.77 to $4.99 compared to $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This guidance includes an estimated benefit to full year 2023 earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. \n As noted on our last earnings call, we had expected fiscal 2023 to be another challenging year. This was especially true given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environment. As a result of today's uncertain external landscape, especially the prolonged inflationary pressures negatively impacting our customers' discretionary spend, shoppers are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, we remain focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible while diligently managing expenses and inventory to maximize our opportunities for growth. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: So Barbara, maybe given the pressure on your low to middle income or low to moderate income customer base that you cited, how do you feel today about your merchandise assortments across categories from that value perspective? And then how are you managing buys in the marketplace just given the current level of disruption across the apparel landscape today? \nBarbara Rentler: The merchandise assortments from value perspective -- first, let me lead with, we weren't really satisfied with our results. So as I look across the different businesses, we had some businesses where the business didn't perform as well as we had expected, and we're addressing those issues. So let me start with that. As I look at value across the store, that has been a main focus for the merchants for the last few months. So I'd say that we've made progress across the board, but I still think that that is a major focus for us, offering the customer the best branded bargains possible at the best possible values we can put out there. \n So I would say we're on a journey, and everyone is -- really, the merchant team is highly focused on this. And I really think that that's an important part, especially for our mid- to lower-income customers. \n And then in terms of managing -- you're saying in terms of managing supply in the marketplace, is that how I interpret that question? \nMatthew Boss: Yes, just how you're managing buys given how much disruption there is in the overall apparel landscape? How much you're leaving, thinking about current open to buy and relative to maybe things opportunistic from a packaway perspective. \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. Well, we have enough open to buy for both packaway and to chase the business. So right now, the plan is postured that we would chase the business as we're coming across and we're monitoring the speed of spending. And the hotel, same scenario. Hotel inventories are basically at the same rate as they were last year. And so the merchants are out in the market seeking out deals and based on those deals, we make those decisions. So if a deal comes in one business and that wasn't really even planned for that business, we might take that plan up. \n So we're really looking for with the overarching idea that what we want to do is get best possible values on the floor. So the merchants go to the market, and then there's discussions about what's out there. I know you know that there is pretty broad-based availability out there, maybe across most businesses anyway, in most brands in the market because as you know, supply fluctuates by type of product and vendor. But you have to kind of be out there and be in it to really see what's out there and then come back and then decide where do we want to take the deal. But that is our focus in both companies, delivering the best branded bargains that we possibly can. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: So you're holding your comp guide for the year, though, you noted the consumer is looking for a deeper value and your merchants are focused on that. So I guess I'm wondering how the expected makeup of that flat comp has changed versus your expectations at the start of the year? And to the extent that there's perhaps some lower ticket involved, are there any margin implications we should be aware of? \nMichael Hartshorn: Mark, it's Michael Hartshorn. Let me start by just talking a little bit about the first quarter. The comp in the first quarter was driven by a number of transactions, and that was -- for us, that's our proxy for traffic. It was up versus a year ago. So that's a good sign on customer traffic returning. The average basket was flat and it was flat on units per transaction, up on a lower AUR. \n As far as how we're looking at the year, our outlook has not changed. We'll continue to manage the business with a conservative posture and be in a position to chase trends, chase the business and manage expense and inventory very conservatively. \n On a stack basis as we move through the quarter, and as weather became more favorable, we did see trends improve on a multiyear basis. So what that says to us is, obviously, healthy traffic and a trend that, in our mind, hasn't changed and hasn't changed our outlook for the year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. \nPaul Lejuez: Curious about geographic dispersion, maybe if you could talk about some of your big states performance in those states, specifically California. How the trends look from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter? And if maybe you could talk about apparel versus home performance. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Paul. On trends during the quarter, as I just mentioned, on a stack basis, we did see -- and stack basis versus pre-COVID, we did see trends improve as we moved through the quarter with April being the strongest. Geographically, we mentioned the Midwest with the top-performing region for our larger markets. Texas was above the chain average. Florida was in line and California underperformed the chain average given the difficult weather throughout the quarter in the West. Merchandise-wise, accessories and cosmetics were the best-performing businesses as we said in the script. Overall, shoes performed above the chain average, while home was in line and apparel trailed. \nPaul Lejuez: Michael, can you just -- a little bit more on California. Any quantification of how much of it was below the chain? And did that gap close that between California and the rest of the chain by the end of the quarter? \nMichael Hartshorn: It did close, it was -- we wouldn't get into the specifics, but it did underperform the chain average and it improved as weather improved. \nOperator: And the next question is from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: As you move through the quarter, did you see any signs of customers trading down into Ross or any other notable changes in consumer behavior? \nMichael Hartshorn: I'd say overall, Lorraine, it was -- it's hard -- there's so many factors that go into sales. Obviously, the low-end customer continues to be pressured, whether it's ongoing inflation, reduction in SNAP benefits, lower tax refunds, but it was hard to see whether there's a trade down customer in that data. \nLorraine Maikis: And the lower AUR in the quarter, was that all moving towards sharper price points? Or is there a mix component to that that we should factor in? \nBarbara Rentler: That's really off of a sharper price point. It wasn't generated by mix. \nOperator: And the next question is from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: The merchandise margin had a nice uptick here in the first quarter relative to the last quarter. Can you talk about the drivers? I think you called out freight and then how you're thinking about that line item over the balance of the year? \nAdam Orvos: Yes. Chuck, this is Adam. So I mentioned the merchandise margin grew by 120 basis points in Q1. Ocean freight was clearly the most impactful component here driving the improvement. Our performance in merc margin was in line with what we embedded in our guidance for Q1. And assuming rates stay where they are, I expect that to continue as we move through the year. \nOperator: And the next question is from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Barbara, I want to ask you about packaway, the 42% this year versus 43%. First and foremost, it sounds like you believe that your assortment is on trend, and then typically, when there are these kind of late weather breaks to kind of warmer weather across retail, it gives you the opportunity to chase into sort of known winters. Do you feel better about the assortment heading into the second quarter? And then, Adam, or Barbara, with frontline still being very promotional, does that somehow impede the ability to drive maybe higher AURs because the value is not as evident as it may be when frontline is a little bit less promotional? \nBarbara Rentler: Okay, Adrienne. So let's start with packaway, I think the first question was about packaway, the content at packaway? So the content at packaway, we feel good about that content at packaway. Last year at this particular moment in time was when we started to bring in goods because of all the carrier issues that went on with whenever things speeded up, we took good and put them into packaway as we told all of you that we use later on in the year, really our direct imports. So the packaway that we have in there now is really closed out great deals that we feel very good about. So the percent might be the same, but the content is different. So that's the first one. \n The second one, in terms of the late weather break, I'm not sure I 100% understand what you mean by that. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: So oftentimes when it's been cold in the Northeast and many people were sort of -- retailers were sort of missing plan for -- just because it was colder than for longer. And in the past, it seems like those types of poor weather transitions have given you the opportunity, but I think you just answered it in your first one. \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Yes, you're saying were there additional great deals out there because weather is good. That's kind of ongoing. And the merchants, yes, are in the market, looking close out facing the business and all of that. So that's very different by type of business. Yes, there are -- so that's part of the supply availability that's out there. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: And the spread, the kind of wide the spread from frontline to your pricing? \nBarbara Rentler: I think you're just saying that they are promoting now, it's more promotional than it's been and then what's our relationship to the promotional environment? \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Yes. Does it make it harder to create that value notion when the frontline retailers are sort of every day sitting on the 50 half. \nBarbara Rentler: Yes. Listen, look, I think the promotional environment is still very -- is still competitive. It's still a competitive market. We watch people get more promotional in the last few months. I don't think that that's going away. I think what has to happen is and what is happening is that the buyers have to be in the market, constantly working with vendors to understand 2 things. One, not only just brand availability, but also pricing because they need -- they know that they need to get -- they need to have their values be sharper. So they're competitive shopping, seeing what's going on in stores and then they're in the market and vendors are giving them the lay of the land, availability, I have -- what you're talking about the excess goods close out and also kind of where the pricing is, they're keeping that in mind because they're studying that. \n So for a while, the world's got very different and there was much more regular price selling, particularly in department stores. We're watching as you're watching that erode and it's becoming more promotional. So those have been best practices for the company for years. And so that's what the merchants are doing to ensure that if they're watching it and then making some assumptions about what they believe could happen in front of them, which would be -- but traditionally done enough price prior to all of the things that have gone on since COVID has started and more regular price selling and all of that. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nKate Fitzsimons: This is Kate on for Ike. I guess just to hone in on the gross margin piece, you guys had a decent amount of volatility in both distribution and buying buckets last year within COGS. Can you walk us through how you think those line items progress through the rest of the year, maybe direction or magnitude? \nAdam Orvos: Yes. Kate, this is Adam. So we'll take them individually. So ocean freight costs, a significant tailwind in Q1. Again, given all the volatility we've seen over time, don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but kind of what's embedded in the guidance is we'll continue to see that as a tailwind as we go through the balance of the year. Domestic freight, we called out the 60 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Again, highly dependent here on fuel prices. And obviously, there's wage increases embedded in those costs. But assuming those things stay stable, would continue to expect that to be a tailwind for us as we go forward. \n The biggest piece that we've called out for some time, offsetting those benefits are incentive costs. So we gave you the details of that approximately in the call comments, I would also say in the second quarter, when we look at it, will probably be the most impactful quarter for us from an incentive cost increase this year versus last year. We also commented on distribution expenses. So again, driven by timing of packaway and then the planned deleverage from our newer distribution center in Houston. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: Great. So it feels like this is kind of an ongoing narrative for the last year that you're not super happy with the value you're offering the customer. Though historically, I think you've proven super consistent and successful there. So I'm just wondering, has anything changed in the buying organization? Or what do you think the buying team is getting wrong now? And maybe how you're thinking about correcting this or putting initiatives in place to perhaps get this back on track? \nBarbara Rentler: Look, I think the value equation we've been working on for the last few months -- over the last year, moving towards getting to that value point, I think we're kind of at a different place now than where we were a few months ago, both in brands and in values on the floor. So I don't see it kind of the merchants aren't doing their job. I kind of see it as an evolution. And so we are very, very highly focused now on delivering compelling value as we watch our customers in both companies struggle with all the inflation and all the things that are going on around them, we've gotten pretty beary. \n Let me put this way, we're very highly focused on delivering those values. So where we were, let's say, 6 months ago and how we're thinking about it now, continues to evolve. And so we want to make sure that we have a really wide assortment, fresh receipts, branded merchandise and where it's appropriate that we're sharpening our branded values to strengthen the offerings because of the competitive retail environment. So I don't feel like it's not necessarily working, I feel like it's evolving, and I think our business last year evolved as we went along, and it's important for us to make sure that we deliver really sharp value to our customers, particularly in this time frame. And now that the world is getting even more competitive and more promotional, we have to look through that lens also. \n So I think that we need to stay focused on it and do a better job on this and making sure that we really understand where it's appropriate that we are sharpening out our branded values. And so I don't think it's not working. I think it's much more of an evolution in all of our businesses. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Any change in the percent of sales being driven by top vendors versus last year and then just versus a historical trend. Just wondering if concentration of the largest vendors has changed at all? And then just because it's coming up fairly frequently, any updated thoughts on shrink. \nMichael Hartshorn: I'll start. It's Michael, Simeon. On shrink, we -- the shrink was a little bit higher for us last year, wasn't meaningfully higher. We've assumed that it will stay at or slightly above those levels in our estimates, but no updates -- we typically update the financial impact of that when we take true up our physical inventory in the third quarter. \nBarbara Rentler: And the percentage of our top vendors versus historical, I mean, that moves based up of supply, right? So one year, we could have a great deal of merchandise from one vendor, top vendor and then the next year, a little bit less, but a little bit more from someone else. So I think that it kind of moves around. I don't think it's changed that much. I don't know if we're defining as top vendors, but it hasn't changed that much. It changes more by the vendor itself and the availability that's out there. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the performance of dd's and what's happening in the environment, was there any differential in dd's performance in the fourth quarter to the first quarter and what you saw? And then just lastly, on the Bed Bath & Beyond locations that are available, if you were to get any, would that be in addition to the current run rate of store openings this year? Or would it be part of it? \nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, on dd's, the sales trends continue to trail Ross' results during the first quarter. I wouldn't comment on the differential between fourth and first. Obviously, their customer faces even more macro headwinds relative to Ross', which is, I think, reflected in their underperformance. I would also say, though, similar to Ross, we are sharply focused on offering better values to help drive improved sales performance there. \n On Bed Bath & Beyond, it will no doubt provide opportunities for new store locations. We'll have to review each potential new site on a case-by-case basis to see if it's appropriate for us. But I would say, it's not going to impact our 100 store opening plan for this year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: I guess just a question for me is as you think about what's happening in the macro, when you look at your good, better, best mix, are you migrating your offering to the lower end of the spectrum? I'm just curious just in terms of the buys or how you're thinking about the merchandising piece of it. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So we have a good, better, best strategy, and that is really driven by the assortment that we put on the floor and the values we put out there. So we want a tiered strategy because we're going to track much more broader set of customers. But that can move based on supply, based on availability, based on our purchases. So it fluctuates as you go. \nRobert Drbul: And your -- as you think about the rest of the year, you're not really buying for sort of more of a good environment versus a better versus best in your offering? \nBarbara Rentler: I think that depends by business. I think that I can't tell you that that is a company-wide strategy. I think that moves by business based on what the business is. And clearly, the dd's customer, in particular, is very price-sensitive, so really paying attention to the values we're putting on the floor or the pricing we're putting on the floor, both. So -- but even at dd's, these things, it moves around. So we are obviously conscious there, particularly with that customer. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: Given the ongoing inflationary pressures in the macro, I'm wondering if you can provide updated thoughts on the longer-term path to recapturing pre-COVID operating margins? Are there any initiatives that you're contemplating to help drive that recovery outside of sharpening values and driving additional market share capture? \nAdam Orvos: Brooke, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. So our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but -- over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We're seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we're still -- these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we're seeing some wage pressures in the stores. \n When you talk about -- we've guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers. So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we've touched on in the past. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine: It's about the weather's impact on your comp in Q1. Is that something you can quantify or maybe if that's a tough one, maybe give us the discrepancy roughly between California and the rest of the chain? \nMichael Hartshorn: Laura, it's hard to calculate. I mean, I think it -- suffice it to say, it didn't help our business. I would say California was slightly under the -- trailed the chain average and did improve as weather improved is what we'd say. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: I just wanted to clarify. I think you said the 53rd week adds about $0.15. Could we expect between like $350 million to $400 million in sales? Is that a decent number to use for that week? Or is it a little less because it's a January week? Just curious. \nAdam Orvos: Probably a little bit less than that, Marni, given that it's, as you said, given that it's January, early February. \nMarni Shapiro: That's what I figured. And then this came up on other calls, it looks like your traffic is good that people are looking for sharper deals, but you obviously called out accessories and cosmetics beauty, which tends to have a lower AUR. Are people gravitating towards the lower-priced items? Or as you've seen the weather improve, have you seen apparel come back in slightly higher AUR, but they're looking for the apparel items that are on sale or just at the better prices. I'm curious sort of what the dynamic is there. \nBarbara Rentler: So apparel struggled in Q1. So I don't necessarily think it was driven off the prices. I think that the assortments were not necessarily where we wanted them to be. So depending upon what this discussion, that could have been the price, that could have been the product because there's a variety of factors in there. So I don't think I could take it down to a common denominator price or say, was it driven by markdowns or was it driven -- it really -- I would say, it was driven by the assortment when it's all said and done. Certainly, the weather didn't help, but I don't think the weather is a big enough impact, so I could sit here and say that. I think our assortments weren't necessarily where we wanted them to be. And so we're working on that, and we're going to continue to work on that. But it's not really based off of a price or one thing or -- we have our work cut out for us and the merchants are working on that now. \nMichael Hartshorn: It wasn't driven by mix. It was driven -- being sharper priced across the assortment. \nMarni Shapiro: So it was across -- you saw the softness across the assortment in apparel. It wasn't specific -- AUR? \nMichael Hartshorn: You asked that was AUR driven by mix in the business. It was not driven by mix. \nMarni Shapiro: But on the apparel side, was the softness across the board, whether it was men's Polo shirts or women's dresses or kids, every department across the board was soft? Or were there certain spots even without disclosing if you don't want to, were there certain spots that were -- that really need a lot of work and other spots that were okay. \nBarbara Rentler: Well, obviously, we're not going to get into details, but within all the apparel businesses, like common sense to tell you that some businesses are better than others, right? So with that, we wouldn't get into specifics, but there's no -- you're asking is there like you're [indiscernible]. In one particular area? I don't know. I know what you're referring [indiscernible] there. \nMarni Shapiro: I was kind of thinking on the positive. Was there something that you're saying -- dress were killer. \nBarbara Rentler: Couldn't decide where you were going with that. Every business has businesses that were performing, some businesses didn't and so we're not going to get into specifics on that. What I would say is that the merchants are very diligently working on the assortments, whether it's delivering the right products, whether it's the values, I mean they're really highly focused on that right now. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. \nCorey Tarlowe: Barbara, just on the availability across your good, better, best spectrum that you have. Is there any better availability within any one of those 3 segments as you speak to your merchants? \nBarbara Rentler: You're just saying where does the supply -- the supply is pretty broad-based. I mean supply in most businesses, there's always more one vendor than the other, more on product than the other. I mean, it fluctuates overall, there's still a lot of supply. I wouldn't say it's bucketed in one of those 3 buckets. No, I would still say it's pretty broad-based. \nCorey Tarlowe: Got it. And then just on the lower AUR common being driven by sharper price points. I guess within the context of the guide for the full year for flat comps, is the expectation that the AUR is likely to be lower throughout the rest of the year as well? \nBarbara Rentler: The -- putting out better value doesn't necessarily mean that your AUR is going down. But what we're focused on is we're focused on delivering really sharp value. So depending upon what -- you're -- using your example of the good, better, best depending upon what that mix looks like, that doesn't necessarily mean the AUR is going down. What we're really trying to do is we're really trying to focus on sharpening our branded values for the customer. And so we think that's our path to driving sales, and we think that's our path ultimately to gaining market share. So those 2 don't necessarily go hand in hand. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. \nJay Sole: It looks like you beat the low end of your -- the guidance that you gave for EPS in the first quarter by about $0.10, but you're raising the low end of the full year guidance by about $0.12. Can you just tell us what the extra $0.02 is, where that's coming from? \nMichael Hartshorn: Yes. I think the better way to look at it is what we did on the top end. We beat the top end by 4, you lose a quarter in that, and then we raised the full year by the $0.04. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: So your guidance implies -- your 2-year stack comp for this quarter was minus 6%, and your guidance implies a deceleration of that stack to about minus 7% for Q2 and then a pickup in the back half to get kind of closer to 0 to your stack. Can you talk about how you're thinking about the progression through the year? And why are you more cautious about Q2 and then a little bit more optimistic for the back half of the year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Aneesha. I think it's hard to look at these on a 2-year stack with all the fiscal stimulus and COVID. So we're really looking at it, pre-COVID, what's changed on a 4-year stack and how that's progressed over time. And we went into the year and had a plan in the first quarter. What we saw is that 4-year stack improved as we move through the quarter and weather improved and exited in a place that would support that stack guidance for the year. \nAneesha Sherman: Okay. So just to clarify, you are embedding an improvement in the 4-year stack through the course of the year? \nMichael Hartshorn: Correct, yes. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Krista Zuber with TD Cowen. \nKrista Zuber: It's Krista on for John. Just a quick question. On inventory, you've had several -- at least 2 quarters here of a fairly sizable declines. Just wondering how you're thinking about it through the balance of this year. And should we continue to expect declines on a quarterly basis through the end of the year? Or do you think at some point, you sort of pull in line with your sales growth expectations. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. It's -- if you look at the first quarter, for instance, we were down 16%, but we were up against elevated inventories last year when supply chain lead times eased, and we had a surplus of early receipts. So what you'd expect as we move through the year with the -- with that elevated inventory last year, it started to recede, in the third and fourth quarter and you get more comparable, but we should be lower given the excess inventory we had last year in the first half of the year. \nOperator: And at this time, I'm seeing no further questions. I'd like to pass it back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thanks for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. \n Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. \n We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2023 performance, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, despite continued inflationary pressures impacting our low to moderate income customers, first quarter sales were relatively in line with our expectations. Total sales of $4.5 billion, up from $4.3 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 1%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023, are $1.09 on net income of $371 million. These results compare to $0.97 per share on net earnings of $338 million for the 13 weeks ended April 30, 2022. \n Cosmetics and accessories were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while the Midwest was the top-performing region. dd's DISCOUNTS performance in the first quarter continued to trail Ross, reflecting the aforementioned inflationary pressures that continues to have a larger impact on our lower income households. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were down 16% versus last year. Average store inventories were up 2% at the end of the quarter. Packaway merchandise represented 42% of total inventories versus 43% last year.\n Turning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 8 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 100 new stores this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 25 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 stores. \n Now, Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. Thank you, Adam. \n As noted on our last earnings call, we had expected fiscal 2023 to be another challenging year. This was especially true given the continued uncertainty in the macroeconomic, geopolitical and retail environment. As a result of today's uncertain external landscape, especially the prolonged inflationary pressures negatively impacting our customers' discretionary spend, shoppers are seeking even stronger values when visiting our stores. In response, we remain focused on delivering the most compelling bargains possible while diligently managing expenses and inventory to maximize our opportunities for growth. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. The merchandise assortments from value perspective -- first, let me lead with, we weren't really satisfied with our results. So as I look across the different businesses, we had some businesses where the business didn't perform as well as we had expected, and we're addressing those issues. So let me start with that. As I look at value across the store, that has been a main focus for the merchants for the last few months. So I'd say that we've made progress across the board, but I still think that that is a major focus for us, offering the customer the best branded bargains possible at the best possible values we can put out there. \n So I would say we're on a journey, and everyone is -- really, the merchant team is highly focused on this. And I really think that that's an important part, especially for our mid- to lower-income customers. \n And then in terms of managing -- you're saying in terms of managing supply in the marketplace, is that how I interpret that question? Okay. Well, we have enough open to buy for both packaway and to chase the business. So right now, the plan is postured that we would chase the business as we're coming across and we're monitoring the speed of spending. And the hotel, same scenario. Hotel inventories are basically at the same rate as they were last year. And so the merchants are out in the market seeking out deals and based on those deals, we make those decisions. So if a deal comes in one business and that wasn't really even planned for that business, we might take that plan up. \n So we're really looking for with the overarching idea that what we want to do is get best possible values on the floor. So the merchants go to the market, and then there's discussions about what's out there. I know you know that there is pretty broad-based availability out there, maybe across most businesses anyway, in most brands in the market because as you know, supply fluctuates by type of product and vendor. But you have to kind of be out there and be in it to really see what's out there and then come back and then decide where do we want to take the deal. But that is our focus in both companies, delivering the best branded bargains that we possibly can. That's really off of a sharper price point. It wasn't generated by mix. Okay, Adrienne. So let's start with packaway, I think the first question was about packaway, the content at packaway? So the content at packaway, we feel good about that content at packaway. Last year at this particular moment in time was when we started to bring in goods because of all the carrier issues that went on with whenever things speeded up, we took good and put them into packaway as we told all of you that we use later on in the year, really our direct imports. So the packaway that we have in there now is really closed out great deals that we feel very good about. So the percent might be the same, but the content is different. So that's the first one. \n The second one, in terms of the late weather break, I'm not sure I 100% understand what you mean by that. Yes. Yes, you're saying were there additional great deals out there because weather is good. That's kind of ongoing. And the merchants, yes, are in the market, looking close out facing the business and all of that. So that's very different by type of business. Yes, there are -- so that's part of the supply availability that's out there. I think you're just saying that they are promoting now, it's more promotional than it's been and then what's our relationship to the promotional environment? Yes. Listen, look, I think the promotional environment is still very -- is still competitive. It's still a competitive market. We watch people get more promotional in the last few months. I don't think that that's going away. I think what has to happen is and what is happening is that the buyers have to be in the market, constantly working with vendors to understand 2 things. One, not only just brand availability, but also pricing because they need -- they know that they need to get -- they need to have their values be sharper. So they're competitive shopping, seeing what's going on in stores and then they're in the market and vendors are giving them the lay of the land, availability, I have -- what you're talking about the excess goods close out and also kind of where the pricing is, they're keeping that in mind because they're studying that. \n So for a while, the world's got very different and there was much more regular price selling, particularly in department stores. We're watching as you're watching that erode and it's becoming more promotional. So those have been best practices for the company for years. And so that's what the merchants are doing to ensure that if they're watching it and then making some assumptions about what they believe could happen in front of them, which would be -- but traditionally done enough price prior to all of the things that have gone on since COVID has started and more regular price selling and all of that. Look, I think the value equation we've been working on for the last few months -- over the last year, moving towards getting to that value point, I think we're kind of at a different place now than where we were a few months ago, both in brands and in values on the floor. So I don't see it kind of the merchants aren't doing their job. I kind of see it as an evolution. And so we are very, very highly focused now on delivering compelling value as we watch our customers in both companies struggle with all the inflation and all the things that are going on around them, we've gotten pretty beary. \n Let me put this way, we're very highly focused on delivering those values. So where we were, let's say, 6 months ago and how we're thinking about it now, continues to evolve. And so we want to make sure that we have a really wide assortment, fresh receipts, branded merchandise and where it's appropriate that we're sharpening our branded values to strengthen the offerings because of the competitive retail environment. So I don't feel like it's not necessarily working, I feel like it's evolving, and I think our business last year evolved as we went along, and it's important for us to make sure that we deliver really sharp value to our customers, particularly in this time frame. And now that the world is getting even more competitive and more promotional, we have to look through that lens also. \n So I think that we need to stay focused on it and do a better job on this and making sure that we really understand where it's appropriate that we are sharpening out our branded values. And so I don't think it's not working. I think it's much more of an evolution in all of our businesses. And the percentage of our top vendors versus historical, I mean, that moves based up of supply, right? So one year, we could have a great deal of merchandise from one vendor, top vendor and then the next year, a little bit less, but a little bit more from someone else. So I think that it kind of moves around. I don't think it's changed that much. I don't know if we're defining as top vendors, but it hasn't changed that much. It changes more by the vendor itself and the availability that's out there. Sure. So we have a good, better, best strategy, and that is really driven by the assortment that we put on the floor and the values we put out there. So we want a tiered strategy because we're going to track much more broader set of customers. But that can move based on supply, based on availability, based on our purchases. So it fluctuates as you go. I think that depends by business. I think that I can't tell you that that is a company-wide strategy. I think that moves by business based on what the business is. And clearly, the dd's customer, in particular, is very price-sensitive, so really paying attention to the values we're putting on the floor or the pricing we're putting on the floor, both. So -- but even at dd's, these things, it moves around. So we are obviously conscious there, particularly with that customer. So apparel struggled in Q1. So I don't necessarily think it was driven off the prices. I think that the assortments were not necessarily where we wanted them to be. So depending upon what this discussion, that could have been the price, that could have been the product because there's a variety of factors in there. So I don't think I could take it down to a common denominator price or say, was it driven by markdowns or was it driven -- it really -- I would say, it was driven by the assortment when it's all said and done. Certainly, the weather didn't help, but I don't think the weather is a big enough impact, so I could sit here and say that. I think our assortments weren't necessarily where we wanted them to be. And so we're working on that, and we're going to continue to work on that. But it's not really based off of a price or one thing or -- we have our work cut out for us and the merchants are working on that now. Well, obviously, we're not going to get into details, but within all the apparel businesses, like common sense to tell you that some businesses are better than others, right? So with that, we wouldn't get into specifics, but there's no -- you're asking is there like you're [indiscernible]. In one particular area? I don't know. I know what you're referring [indiscernible] there. Couldn't decide where you were going with that. Every business has businesses that were performing, some businesses didn't and so we're not going to get into specifics on that. What I would say is that the merchants are very diligently working on the assortments, whether it's delivering the right products, whether it's the values, I mean they're really highly focused on that right now. You're just saying where does the supply -- the supply is pretty broad-based. I mean supply in most businesses, there's always more one vendor than the other, more on product than the other. I mean, it fluctuates overall, there's still a lot of supply. I wouldn't say it's bucketed in one of those 3 buckets. No, I would still say it's pretty broad-based. The -- putting out better value doesn't necessarily mean that your AUR is going down. But what we're focused on is we're focused on delivering really sharp value. So depending upon what -- you're -- using your example of the good, better, best depending upon what that mix looks like, that doesn't necessarily mean the AUR is going down. What we're really trying to do is we're really trying to focus on sharpening our branded values for the customer. And so we think that's our path to driving sales, and we think that's our path ultimately to gaining market share. So those 2 don't necessarily go hand in hand. Thanks for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. \n As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 1% for the quarter, driven by an increase in transactions. First quarter operating margin of 10.1% was down from 10.8% in 2022. As expected, this decline primarily reflects higher incentive compensation versus last year when we underperformed our expectations. \n Cost of goods sold improved by 50 basis points due to a combination of factors. Merchandise margin was up 120 basis points, primarily due to lower ocean freight costs, while domestic freight costs declined by 60 basis points. \n Partially offsetting these 2 favorable items were higher distribution expenses of 65 basis points, driven primarily by unfavorable packaway-related costs and deleverage from the opening of our Houston distribution center. Buying increased by 60 basis points due to higher incentive compensation and occupancy deleveraged 5 basis points. \n SG&A for the period rose 115 basis points, mainly due to higher incentive compensation and store wages versus last year. During the first quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $234 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $950 million in stock for the year. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2023. \n For the 13 weeks ending July 29, 2023, comparable sales are forecast to be relatively flat. Second quarter 2023 earnings per share are projected to be $1.07 to $1.14 versus $1.11 for the 13 weeks ended July 30, 2022. \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2023 include the following: total sales are forecast to increase 1% to 4% versus the prior year. We plan to open 27 locations in the second quarter, including 18 Ross and 9 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Operating margin for the second quarter is planned to be in the 9.8% to 10.1% range, down from 11.3% in 2022 as higher merchandise margin from lower ocean freight cost is forecast to be offset by an increase in expenses, primarily related to incentive compensation and store wages. \n We expect net interest income to be approximately $31 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 339 million. \n Now turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and guidance for the second quarter, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending January 27, 2024, are still planned to be relatively flat. We now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2024, to be $4.77 to $4.99 compared to $4.38 for the 52 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This guidance includes an estimated benefit to full year 2023 earnings per share of approximately $0.15 from the 53rd week. \n Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. Yes. Chuck, this is Adam. So I mentioned the merchandise margin grew by 120 basis points in Q1. Ocean freight was clearly the most impactful component here driving the improvement. Our performance in merc margin was in line with what we embedded in our guidance for Q1. And assuming rates stay where they are, I expect that to continue as we move through the year. Yes. Kate, this is Adam. So we'll take them individually. So ocean freight costs, a significant tailwind in Q1. Again, given all the volatility we've seen over time, don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but kind of what's embedded in the guidance is we'll continue to see that as a tailwind as we go through the balance of the year. Domestic freight, we called out the 60 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Again, highly dependent here on fuel prices. And obviously, there's wage increases embedded in those costs. But assuming those things stay stable, would continue to expect that to be a tailwind for us as we go forward. \n The biggest piece that we've called out for some time, offsetting those benefits are incentive costs. So we gave you the details of that approximately in the call comments, I would also say in the second quarter, when we look at it, will probably be the most impactful quarter for us from an incentive cost increase this year versus last year. We also commented on distribution expenses. So again, driven by timing of packaway and then the planned deleverage from our newer distribution center in Houston. Brooke, this is Adam. Thanks for the question. So our long-term operating margin improvements are to be highly dependent on us delivering strong sales over a sustained period of time. And then the question on how long do inflationary pressures persist, but -- over the longer term, we believe we can achieve gradual improvement in profitability. I think if you get into like, are there any structural questions related to that? We're seeing tangible benefit in freight cost, but we're still -- these costs still are not at pre-pandemic levels. And then we're seeing some wage pressures in the stores. \n When you talk about -- we've guided to CapEx of $810 million. So a big component of that in addition to distribution center capacity, in addition to investing in the 100 new stores, a big chunk of that is technology investments that will drive further efficiencies within the stores and in our distribution centers. So more automation in our distribution centers and some store initiatives that we've touched on in the past. Probably a little bit less than that, Marni, given that it's, as you said, given that it's January, early February."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Mark, it's Michael Hartshorn. Let me start by just talking a little bit about the first quarter. The comp in the first quarter was driven by a number of transactions, and that was -- for us, that's our proxy for traffic. It was up versus a year ago. So that's a good sign on customer traffic returning. The average basket was flat and it was flat on units per transaction, up on a lower AUR. \n As far as how we're looking at the year, our outlook has not changed. We'll continue to manage the business with a conservative posture and be in a position to chase trends, chase the business and manage expense and inventory very conservatively. \n On a stack basis as we move through the quarter, and as weather became more favorable, we did see trends improve on a multiyear basis. So what that says to us is, obviously, healthy traffic and a trend that, in our mind, hasn't changed and hasn't changed our outlook for the year. Sure, Paul. On trends during the quarter, as I just mentioned, on a stack basis, we did see -- and stack basis versus pre-COVID, we did see trends improve as we moved through the quarter with April being the strongest. Geographically, we mentioned the Midwest with the top-performing region for our larger markets. Texas was above the chain average. Florida was in line and California underperformed the chain average given the difficult weather throughout the quarter in the West. Merchandise-wise, accessories and cosmetics were the best-performing businesses as we said in the script. Overall, shoes performed above the chain average, while home was in line and apparel trailed. It did close, it was -- we wouldn't get into the specifics, but it did underperform the chain average and it improved as weather improved. I'd say overall, Lorraine, it was -- it's hard -- there's so many factors that go into sales. Obviously, the low-end customer continues to be pressured, whether it's ongoing inflation, reduction in SNAP benefits, lower tax refunds, but it was hard to see whether there's a trade down customer in that data. I'll start. It's Michael, Simeon. On shrink, we -- the shrink was a little bit higher for us last year, wasn't meaningfully higher. We've assumed that it will stay at or slightly above those levels in our estimates, but no updates -- we typically update the financial impact of that when we take true up our physical inventory in the third quarter. Dana, on dd's, the sales trends continue to trail Ross' results during the first quarter. I wouldn't comment on the differential between fourth and first. Obviously, their customer faces even more macro headwinds relative to Ross', which is, I think, reflected in their underperformance. I would also say, though, similar to Ross, we are sharply focused on offering better values to help drive improved sales performance there. \n On Bed Bath & Beyond, it will no doubt provide opportunities for new store locations. We'll have to review each potential new site on a case-by-case basis to see if it's appropriate for us. But I would say, it's not going to impact our 100 store opening plan for this year. Laura, it's hard to calculate. I mean, I think it -- suffice it to say, it didn't help our business. I would say California was slightly under the -- trailed the chain average and did improve as weather improved is what we'd say. It wasn't driven by mix. It was driven -- being sharper priced across the assortment. You asked that was AUR driven by mix in the business. It was not driven by mix. Yes. I think the better way to look at it is what we did on the top end. We beat the top end by 4, you lose a quarter in that, and then we raised the full year by the $0.04. Sure, Aneesha. I think it's hard to look at these on a 2-year stack with all the fiscal stimulus and COVID. So we're really looking at it, pre-COVID, what's changed on a 4-year stack and how that's progressed over time. And we went into the year and had a plan in the first quarter. What we saw is that 4-year stack improved as we move through the quarter and weather improved and exited in a place that would support that stack guidance for the year. Correct, yes. Sure. It's -- if you look at the first quarter, for instance, we were down 16%, but we were up against elevated inventories last year when supply chain lead times eased, and we had a surplus of early receipts. So what you'd expect as we move through the year with the -- with that elevated inventory last year, it started to recede, in the third and fourth quarter and you get more comparable, but we should be lower given the excess inventory we had last year in the first half of the year."

The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question and answer session. If anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press star zero. Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings, and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and fiscal 2024 Form 10-Qs and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now I would like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Good afternoon.\nBarbara Rentler: Joining me in our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Before we get started, on behalf of our board and the entire company, we are excited to welcome Jim Conroy to Ross Stores as CEO-elect next month. Following a two-month transition, Jim will assume the CEO role on February 2, 2025. Jim is a talented and proven retail executive with a demonstrated track record of developing and leading successful management teams and creating tremendous value for shareholders. As I previously announced, I will move into an advisory role at the beginning of fiscal 2025 and will support Jim and our other senior executives on merchandising-related strategies through March of 2027. Let's turn to our earnings results. As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our third-quarter sales results as business slowed from the solid gains we reported in the first half of 2024. Although our low to moderate-income customers continue to face persistently high costs on necessities, pressuring discretionary spending, we believe we should have better executed some of our merchandising initiatives. In addition, we estimate a combination of severe weather during the quarter from Hurricane Lane and Hilton, along with unseasonably warm temperatures, also negatively impacted comps by about one percent. Despite the below-planned sales results, earnings were ahead of our expectations. Operating margin for the quarter was up 75 basis points to 11.9% versus 11.2% last year, as lower incentive freight and distribution costs more than offset the planned decline in merchandise margin. Total sales for the period grew to $5.1 billion, up from $4.9 billion in the prior year, with comparable store sales up one percent. Earnings per share for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, were $1.48 compared to earnings per share of $1.33 last year. Net income for the period rose to $489 million versus $447 million in the prior year period. For the first nine months, earnings per share were $4.53 on net earnings of $1.5 billion compared to $3.74 per share on net income of $1.3 billion for the same period last year. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $15.2 billion with comparable store sales up three percent over last year. For the third quarter, cosmetics, accessories, and children were the strongest merchandise areas, while California and Texas were the best-performing regions. Similar to the second quarter, DD's Discounts' strong value of fashion offerings continues to resonate with its shoppers, with comp gains exceeding Ross's results. At quarter-end, total consolidated inventories were up nine percent versus last year, while average store inventories were up one percent. Packaway merchandise represented 38% of total inventory compared to 39% last year. During the third quarter, we also completed our expansion program for 2024 with the addition of 43 new Ross and four DD's Discount stores. For the year, we added a total of 89 locations, comprised of 75 Ross and 14 DD's. We plan to close and/or relocate seven locations in the fourth quarter and expect to end the year with 1,831 Ross stores and 354 DD's Discount locations. Now Adam will provide further details on our third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guidance.\nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose one percent in the quarter. Operating margin increased 75 basis points to 11.9%. Cost of goods sold improved by 70 basis points in the quarter. Buying levered by 65 basis points mainly due to lower incentives while distribution and domestic freight costs declined by 50 and 40 basis points respectively. Occupancy rose by 25 basis points while merchandise margin decreased by 60 basis points. SG&A cost for the period improved by five basis points, primarily due to lower incentive costs. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our fourth-quarter guidance. For the thirteen weeks ending February 1, 2025, we continue to project comparable store sales to increase two percent to three percent. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter are planned to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.64, compared to $1.82 in the fourth quarter of 2023. This guidance range includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share primarily from the timing of packaway-related expenses that benefited the third quarter. Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth-quarter forecast, earnings per share for the fifty-two weeks ending February 1, 2025, are now expected to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.17 versus $5.56 last year. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter and full-year results included an extra week that benefited earnings by approximately $0.20. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth-quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to decline one percent to three percent. As a reminder, last year's extra week contributed $308 million to sales. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% versus 12.4% last year. Last year's fourth quarter included an 80 basis point benefit from the extra week. This outlook reflects lower merchandise margin, as we continue to increase the penetration of quality branded merchandise partially offset by lower incentive and freight expenses. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $24 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 329 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. To sum up, we believe we have opportunities to improve our merchandise execution and remain confident that our ongoing focus and commitment to delivering the most will best position our company for profitable growth over the near and long term. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press the star key followed by one on your telephone keypad. You may press star two to remove a question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the keys. In order to give everyone a chance to ask a question, we ask that you limit yourself to one question only. Thank you. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks. So Barbara, can you elaborate maybe on the opportunities to improve merchandising execution that you cited? Any assortment changes for the holiday or just your confidence in two to three comps for the fourth quarter? And then, Adam, as we think about gross margin, maybe just gross margin relative to plan, especially on the merchandise margin side in the third quarter. And any differences in drivers as we think about fourth quarter puts and takes relative to the third?\nBarbara Rentler: For Matt, the first opportunity to change is in the assortment. I think we had some execution issues in a couple of businesses that we've identified and that we think we can correct. We didn't probably move as quickly as we should have in some things where there were some, I would say, shifts in the world from a product perspective. So I feel like that's an opportunity and we missed some volume there. And also as we continue to iterate on our brand strategy and keep improving the brand strategy, listening to the customer and making those changes. So that continues. In terms of the fourth quarter and the acceleration and guidance to two to three, you know, as you get into the fourth quarter, many of the businesses that are really important during the holiday season, and I know you know this, whether it's gifting or cosmetics, you know, those businesses, accessories, have been strengths for us. So as we go into that period, we're going into some of our strongest businesses and also, you know, gifting last year in a lot of our home world was very good, and we're building on that. So I feel like those businesses, you know, should do well during the period. They're doing well now. And, you know, that gives us the confidence on the two to three. And, again, we'll continue to iterate on our other strategies in the remainder of the box and where we had some execution issues. We are in the process of, you know, fixing them. And, obviously, you know, we had some weather issues in Q3 that, you know, who knows what will happen from a weather perspective across the country for any of us. But we also had some of that.\nAdam Orvos: And Matt, on your question on Q3 and Q4, I would start with merchandise margin. I mentioned it declined by 60 basis points in Q3. Now that result benefited from better-than-expected shrink results as we completed our physical inventory process and trued up our results in Q3. And then looking forward to Q4, probably an uptick in pressure for merchandise margin as we continue to push for more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that we want for our customers in the holiday season. Domestic freight, we mentioned, was worth 40 basis points in Q3. I would expect that to be pretty consistent in Q4. I'll always caveat it with fuel costs, but assuming they stay where they are, I would expect that to be comparable. Distribution costs again were another source of strength for us. We mentioned the packaway shift that we have to take into account, so that'll put pressure on us in Q4. Incentives on both sides will continue to be favorable. We would expect in the fourth quarter as we're again up against a 2023 where we were outperforming in a significant way. And then lastly, obviously, we have the fifty-third week impact that we talked about.\nMatthew Boss: Great color. Best of luck.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you for taking my question. Barbara, you are going to be passing the reins here in a few months but remaining in an advisory role. Maybe speak a little bit more to your areas of focus as you transition your responsibilities. Relatedly, the merchant team still seems to be in the early innings of this value strategy or brand strategy iterating there. I guess then any changes to expect there or, you know, could anything change there with the new leadership? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: My areas of focus obviously will be to spend time with Jim and help him onboard. And to spend my time on merchandising. It will be an advisory role heavily focused on merchandising. I don't foresee any changes to our strategy because our brand strategy is really the key to our market share gains. I don't foresee that. And, you know, but it'll continue to iterate, and that's really where I will spend my time. Obviously, Jim is a very seasoned CEO. And he complements the strengths that we have in merchandising and our operational team. So I feel like Jim is a great add. And, you know, the team will be a good combination together and my role will be to make sure that merchandising continues going forward and that Jim gets transitioned appropriately.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you. Best of luck over the holiday.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez: Good day, guys. Couple of quick ones. Curious if the recognizable brands and how quick you can fix those issues. And, Adam, any quantification of that shrink benefit? How much it helped the merch margin line? And then also curious if you could talk about the performance of some of your initial store openings in the northeast. Thanks.\nBarbara Rentler: The execution issues are actually merchandise. I would say merchandise. This is not so much on the branding. However, you know, the brand strategy, we keep iterating on that and keep listening to the customers. We keep making changes as we go. So obviously and, you know, as we started this in the beginning, I said each business is at a different point at the starting point to where we are now. And so, you know, we keep responding to what the customer is telling us. So I would say that across the board will continue to do. And just some things we're just, yeah, execution issues, which we can fix.\nMichael Hartshorn: Paul, on the shrink, we don't break out shrink separately. What I would say is we, and you know this covering us from over the years, is we completed our physical inventory in the third quarter. We had assumed that shrink was going to be worse for a couple of reasons. One, just the external landscape, but also the increased number of brands in the store. So what that meant is we accrued more going up to physical inventory. And so we took a larger benefit in Q3 that helped EBIT margin not only versus what we guided but versus last year. For the year, though, shrink looks like it's going to be about flat to 2023, again, with the upside in the third quarter. Your last question, Paul, was on the northeast. It's too early to comment on the overall store productivity, but we are pleased with what we've seen thus far.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. As the branded strategy continues to evolve, do you view this as a multiyear merchandise margin headwind? And are there other offsets that you're working on to ease some of this pressure in 2025 and beyond?\nMichael Hartshorn: Lorraine, our expectation is that over time, as we build our brand relationships and as we learn what works best with our customer, that over time, it would be earnings accretion. And we'd expect slight improvements of margins over time.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Thanks. Good afternoon, and congrats on your upcoming retirement, Barbara.\nChuck Grom: Talk about the cadence of sales throughout the quarter? And then also the composition of the comp between traffic and ticket? And then if you could double click on ticket between UBT and AUR. Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the cadence during the quarter, comps were strongest early in the quarter as the weather became more difficult gradually as we moved through the quarter. We did see improvements in sell-throughs in markets when the weather became more seasonable. As we said in the commentary, the comps were driven by traffic. The other component of comp was relatively neutral.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Can you dig in a little bit more to the brand strategy pivot? I guess just first, we need to contextualize, how meaningful is the shift within the mix? Maybe has the early reception? Just curious if you're seeing learnings from or feedback from vendors or consumers maybe just following up on the range, just recognizing the merch margin pressure now, I'm just wondering, ultimately, with better brands, do you think you get to raise price there to fix that margin pressure of so long this take? And before maybe the customers can accept those higher price points at the stronger value? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: Okay. On the early customer acceptance of state of Ohio branches, you know, in many of these businesses, these are not major branches. Right? And so just want to emphasize, you know, that the friendship is good, better, best. All kinds of values and pricing moderate and above. And so in some businesses, the branches weren't that great because they were already at the, I would say, appropriate level that the customer is responding to and really likes, and so it is we didn't do it. In other areas, we felt like we needed to make bolder moves. And ladies, we felt like we needed to make bolder moves than we have. And so with again, we're at different journeys and different acceptance levels by the customer based on what the product is and the area that it is. So it's not just, you know, a straight line but I could say, hey. This is where we are completely on the journey. Some places, we feel that we're there. And in other places, we feel like we have a long road to go, and not a long road. That's probably the biggest question. You know, we have a ways to go with figuring out exactly what it is she wants. And that really tends to be more in our ladies' business. And as you know, ladies is a tougher business. And so we're learning. Merchants are shifting. As the customer is voting, and we want to get that right mix of, you know, right, brands that she likes. And a mix of good, better, best at the level that she enjoys, and we want to just make sure that the entire thing that we're giving compelling values there. Particularly in ladies as ladies is a tough business. Always compared to other parts of apparel.\nSimeon Siegel: So thanks. And so would you expect AUR to naturally progress higher through this, or is it not that meaningful?\nBarbara Rentler: No. Not necessarily. It's not an AUR strategy. It's really a brand and value. So we're not going in and saying we want to raise AUR by x. We're putting out different brands at different levels in a good, better, best. And then it's seeking its own level with the customer. We can see what they like more than others and making adjustments as we go. Because for some businesses, they didn't have to make as big a move perhaps the ladies' business has to make. But it's not an AUR strategy. It's a value strategy. At all brands here so that we're addressing all the customer base. Right? So we have customers who like every price point, and we want to make sure that we fine-tune that so that we can consider that we can still, you know, give that treasure hunt experience to all customers. A store. So, you know, it's a learning and adjustment as we go, and we think that ladies will continue to improve as time goes on. And some other businesses are again, some are tweaked. And some are bigger moves. And the merchant team is very, very on this, and we are very focused on value. Because delivering compelling values is really the single most important thing we need to do. For our future in farm market checking.\nSimeon Siegel: Great. Very much. Good luck for the holiday.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAdrienne Yih: Good afternoon. And Barbara, congratulations on your upcoming retirement as well. Thanks. So just to sort of like sorry. Another question on this. Have you given any color on what the kind of brand penetration or the tweaking that you've done? Like, how much tweaking? Is it, you know, mid-single-digit percent of the assortment? And I know it's going to be very, very hard to do that on a global basis. But any color there on the amount more in brands? And then, Michael, or Adam, perhaps, if you could help give us some color on the differential and guess it'll be different per brand with the differential to kind of the current merch margin is, you know, relative to kind of what a brand might be, like the increased brand penetration. And I guess my final just, like, wrap up on that. Back when you were doing fourteen, fifteen percent operating margins, the gross margin was, you know, a hundred and change, higher twenty-nine percent. So if we do have kind of merch margin pressure, is the offset to come from leverage from just, you know, gaining, you know, higher than your historical kind of one to two comp? Is that how we should think about it? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: I'll start with your last question first. It's Michael. How we see our operating margins going forward, obviously, we have a model over time driven partly by new store growth, comp growth, which has historically been in the three percent to four percent range, and some operating margin improvement in the middle and then our share buyback. We have initiatives throughout the company whether it's technology investments, whether it's cost control, to be able to offset any impact to merchant margins. As I said though earlier, over the longer term, we believe that we can grow merchant margins from this base based on our vendor relationships as this gains traction and also we learn more about what the customer wants.\nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the penetrations, I mean, you know, that's very it's hard to do your right. You can't do it at a global level. It's different by business, and so it's hard to do that. I think that the thing you know, as we started this whole brand thing, you know, and as I sit back and we've been talking about we've talked about brands, we always had brands in the store. I mean, our business model is to have brands. But what we realized is that in some getting surveys and feedback and everything, and in some areas, we needed more. What more is, you know, it is something that you can't I can't stick a number say, hey. This is what we're going to march to because the customer has to decide what that is. I think the most important thing for us to recognize and for everyone to recognize is that we're responding to what she says. Right? And so and then making changes to it. It's hard to just pick a it can't pick percent. Some areas, you know, if we were talking about an area like shoes, we would have said we, you know, we are highly branded. We're highly branded. You know, there weren't so many changes. So it just depends on what it is. I can't give you one number. And the other thing, it will seek its own level. And we'll know we'll know that we've got to like, in some businesses where we feel like we are where we want to be, you know, in some of those, we'll know. We'll know by the terms. We'll know by the markdown. We'll know by how quickly the merchandise is moving through the store and, you know, I think that's really the way to go, which is why it's kind of hard to just on a five. If we're going because the biggest mistake we can make with these is picking a number and just kind of really forging forward to a very large number that maybe is incorrect. So we started out with a number to begin. And we keep iterating again on what she's telling us. And that could be different by product, and it could be different by where I am in some of our business classification.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBrooke Roach: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking our question. Barbara, can you comment on what you're seeing in the macro backdrop for the Ross Stores banner? Outside of the weather events that we saw this quarter, have you seen any change in the way that the consumer is engaging with the brand? And then as a follow-up, it sounds like DD's is still outperforming the Ross Stores banner. What insights are you gaining from that regarding your low-income consumer or is that an execution differential? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: It's Michael Hartshorn, I'll start with the DD's. First, it potentially is the DD's group and merchant have done a very nice job, and we're happy with the adjustments. We've been able to make in the DD's chain been able to improve our value and fashion offerings and it's resonated very well. With the customer and DD's outcome for us for the quarter. One other bright spot for DD's is the newer markets where we slowed growth have improved. But we need to see given that their sales volume started at levels below our expectations, we'll need to see sustained growth there before we ramp up new store growth in some of those newer markets.\nBarbara Rentler: And, Brooke, give me a favor. Give me more flavor around what you want as you're saying the customer engaging with the brand? You're just saying that is there any change in the macro or consumer engagement with your business as we've moved through the early holiday season outside of the weather events?\nBrooke Roach: Yes.\nBarbara Rentler: I think when, you know, I think if we went through this third quarter. You know? I think, you know, it started the third quarter started off strong then weather came. And then obviously, as Michael said before, as the weather changed by region, we watched the consumer come back. So part of it is weather. And then, you know, there's a lot of shifts going on as holidays are coming earlier. This year. So I think part of it is just that. And I think, you know, an earlier Christmas, I think, might change a little bit of the dynamic to have a customer's gonna shop. You know, it's been a long time since we've had Christmas the week before. So but, yes, coming out of the weather, the customer did come back. Brooke, from a just a customer basis on whether an income basis or age basis. We did not in Q3. We haven't seen over time a significant shift on that basis either.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Straton: Perfect. Thanks so much. I just wanted to focus on the full quarter guidance. Is it correct that the outlook hasn't changed much from last time we spoke except for the packaway shift? Or have some pieces within there moved? And then just on the comp acceleration that you're still embedding, should I just assume that that's reflective of what you're seeing quarter to date or what gives you the confidence there?\nMichael Hartshorn: On the guidance, it hasn't changed. The only thing that's changed is packaway. On the guidance itself, first, the unfavorable weather had a negative impact on the third quarter that we're not expecting in the fourth quarter. We'll see how it plays out. As Barbara mentioned earlier, as we move into the fourth quarter, many of our merchandise areas that have been performing well are important fourth-quarter and holiday businesses. And then finally, the guides based, we feel good about our assortments. We have planned for the holiday, especially in gift-giving.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore. Hey, guys. Congrats on a nice quarter.\nMichael Binetti: This is a really big margin beat for a one comp, guys. Is there any near-term change in the leverage point we should think about or, you know, could you help contextualize what you think this in this quarter would not repeat if in the theoretical if we saw one comp again? And then on the branded goods strategy, maybe you just help us understand if the underlying merch margin decelerate or accelerate versus 2Q? You know, if we exclude the shrink true-up, are we past the peak of the branded goods pressure? Or what would maybe what would cause it to accelerate or continue to moderate?\nMichael Hartshorn: Yeah. Michael, on the first piece. So our EPS beat, you know, we talked about merchandise margin coming in better, and expected related to shrink. I would say, we also felt good about just our overall cost management within the quarter. So multiple parts of the P&L benefiting. Now does that change our leverage point? No. We still think three to four percent comp growth is the right place for us to leverage. The shrink is obviously a one-time piece. Right? Because we true up in the third quarter as we always do, and then of course, the packaway is one-time in nature. So I think the only other moving part that we haven't talked about, our EPS benefited by higher interest income. That, you know, that embedded in our guidance is some pressure, you know, assuming further rate cuts. The balance of the year.\nMichael Binetti: Michael, we don't our leverage point hasn't changed. As Adam said, we had a lot of one-timers in the quarter looking forward and even longer term, the leverage point is pretty constant between three and four.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. As you think about the implementation potentially of tariffs going forward, how do you think of your assortment and pricing relative to the tariffs that may come into place and remind us of what happened last time? And then when you think about some of the changes in management, like with DD's, any holes to fill or with this branded strategy, is anything shifting within DD's also given the improved results that we've seen there? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: Dana, on the tariffs, we'll be closely monitoring any developments there, I'm sure everybody across the industry is doing so. It's too early to say what the potential impact could be on us and the rest of retail. Our focus in the case of a tariff increase would be to maintain a pricing umbrella versus traditional retailers and offer the best values to the customer. We will not be a leader in raising prices.\nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of DD's, DD's has a strategy in place that they've been working on. And that'll just continue. So there won't be any other new strategies or additional changes. They'll just be building upon their successes.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nIke Boruchow: Hey, guys. Adam, sorry if I missed it, but could you give us maybe an update on freight in the fourth quarter? And then maybe just high-level state of the union domestic and ocean into next year is how we should expect that line item to kind of progress based on, like, what you have in front of you right now?\nAdam Orvos: Yeah. On the domestic side, so we're forty basis points of improvement in Q3. Probably expect something similar in Q4. It's been tracking pretty consistently all year. On the ocean side, it was a negligible impact in the quarter. You know, in the short term, would expect that. Obviously, we're watching some of the potential disruptions and, you know, watching for the resolution of the strike issue that would impact the East Coast ports and the Gulf ports. So we're watching all those things. But with what we know right now, don't see that as anything other than neutral. And then we'll have to see as you know, we'll come back and talk to you at the beginning of the year on how we see 2025 and beyond. And once we get into the bidding process for next year.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you, Barbara. I'm just wondering if there was anything related to inventory availability or just timing of buying that sort of contributed to some of the issues and execution that you, you know, you decided that impacted Q3? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: Well, in terms of inventory availability, you know, it's favorable. Again, some businesses have more availability than others. In terms of the impact of buying to Q3, I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Jay, by that. It's just that we have found that we were buying or just or that contribute to the quarter's performance? I'm not sure which one you want me to answer.\nJay Sole: Right. Like, perhaps, like, did you buy too much inventory too soon, not leaving enough open to buy? Did you sort of...\nBarbara Rentler: No. I don't think that was part of the issue. And in fact, in seasonal businesses, you know, we leave money open, you know, things like outerwear or whatever because, you know, history would tell us that, you know, you don't know how it's going to start. And so with these merchants leave liquidity so that we don't get caught with that. So no. I don't think it has to do with the speed of what we bought or, you know, I think it's just some of the choices we made or didn't make and but it has nothing to do with that.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. Please proceed with your question.\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, guys. Thanks. Congratulations on the hire and Barbara, you will be missed. I have a quick question for you. The dollar stores collectively have been under a lot of pressure and have made announcements that they're closing a lot of stores. And I'm curious if you could just give us a little insight into how many if any, of your DD's stores or Ross stores, in fact, compete with them in similar areas. Is there an opportunity as they close stores if you'd seen some of those stores close already, and you've seen the customer for certain items shift over to you? If you could just frame that a little bit because it's obviously a big retail conversation.\nMichael Hartshorn: Yeah. I don't have the exact number of stores. Obviously, smaller footprint, a lot more consumables than what we have. In DD's? So I would say it's hard to see any impact. Very different merchandise mix. So could there be some upside potentially, but given what's in the box, I don't see it as a huge upside.\nBarbara Rentler: It's really consumable, Marni. That's really their business is so big, and DD's does a business in consumable. But I think that's I think in what they have in there, I think that's probably to my point, that's probably the biggest overlap slash potential opportunity.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you for taking my question. Barbara, if I can have a follow-up on the brand strategy. So you talked about good, better, best. Are you seeing any differences in the performance of the good versus the best in terms of sell-through and velocity? And then, a follow-up on the weather comment. You said the weather impact to comp was about one percent. As we've come out of some of the weather issues, have you seen the comp run rate in those impacted stores improve? By about that magnitude coming out of the back half of the quarter. Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: Aneesha, on the weather, yes. We did. And I said previously, we did see improvements in sell-throughs in markets where weather became more seasonal within Q3.\nBarbara Rentler: And then on a good, better, best, you know, we turn put overall very quickly in the store. I mean, there's always some turn differential, but the overall churn on apparel is very fast. So think what we I would put it this way. We own the right fit to the right value. It all turns very quickly. If we own the wrong goods, it doesn't turn as quickly. So but overall, the entire box, you know, returns we drive receipts. It's our mission is to drive receipts not on inventory. So churn is always on our mind, but it's again it's about it's really about the value, putting on floor, the product and the value. It always comes back to the product and the value, and then it will turn quickly to the No. Within a treasure hunt environment, if I don't buy, it won't be there next.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen.\nJohn Kernan: Excellent. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to go back on the real estate theme, off-price, whether it's Ross Stores, DD's, your competitors at TJX and growing to the a lot of store growth plans, the next two, three, five years. How much the real estate availability for Ross Stores and across really, regionally, northeast, west, southeast, all countries are? What's your view on the overall availability outlook in the quality of real estate for off-price retail right now?\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, John. I'd say overall, we feel good about what we have and, you know, the real estate landscape. And we have a healthy pipeline for the next couple of years. I would say, you know, real estate is tight. There's not a lot of new centers being constructed. And for us, there's increased interest from other retailers and the types of real estates that we typically prefer. That said, you know, we have a very strong team that has a methodical process of developing a healthy real estate pipeline to support our growth plans over the next number of years.\nOperator: And the final question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for squeezing me in. Your incoming CEO's got a difficult task. I'm curious whether that will likely change the structure of his direct reports or responsibility set. And, also, Barbara, to the extent that you're comfortable talking about it, I think that this is a pretty insular end to especially as you move up the ranks. Why is now a good time to bring someone in from outside off-price from a smaller company?\nBarbara Rentler: Okay. So responsibilities, you know, reporting to him will be two one twenty-five year plus veteran and the other thirty-year plus veteran. So I think from a merger perspective and tenure, and below that level, the group the average tenure is around twenty years below them. So I feel like I think that's fine. I actually think it's good. I think so he's got a very strong bench below him. That understands off-price and, you know, yeah. I mean, I'm very comfortable that the mix is good. And, actually, I think Jim complements some of the talent that we have in the organization. You know, in terms of timing, you know, look, a year and a half ago, when they're in June of 2023, you know, we announced internally, externally, you know, I was going to step down. And the agreement was that with the board that if we found the right person looking internally at externally, the whole thing. When we found the right person, that we would hire that person, I would move to an advisory role. So I don't know if it's necessarily the timing with where we are with this brand strategy. I think the single most important thing is to have the right person. And that to me is in the handoff. That's critical. Right? So I do. I think Jim is the right person. And so and, you know, obviously, there's a lot of tenure at Ross of people who've been here a long time, not only me, but Michael and Norman. You know, there's a lot of people here who've been here a long time. So you know, Jim will learn the business. But I don't it had nothing to do with, you know, we have our branch strategy. No. We're not going to when you find the right person, Lauren, you know. When it's right, it's right, and Jim is the right person. And so that really was a decision, and I was part of that decision. So I feel good about it. And clearly, we're going to make sure that Jim is successful because we have him, you know, pretty surrounded by true off-price veterans who have been doing it, you know, I'm getting older as I'm saying this to you, for years and years and years. But that's really what we've done. And that's really why the timing kind of, you know, it is earlier, but again, when you find the right person, I'm sure you've all done searches. Everyone on this call when you find the right person, you really have to, you know, really have to jump on I'm going to say jump on the opportunity being an off-price. The right so, you know, everything is opportunistic. And so I think the timing is good for the company and he'll be supported all along the way.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this time, there are no further questions. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everybody has a happy holiday.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Joining me in our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President and Chief Operating Officer, Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. Before we get started, on behalf of our board and the entire company, we are excited to welcome Jim Conroy to Ross Stores as CEO-elect next month. Following a two-month transition, Jim will assume the CEO role on February 2, 2025. Jim is a talented and proven retail executive with a demonstrated track record of developing and leading successful management teams and creating tremendous value for shareholders. As I previously announced, I will move into an advisory role at the beginning of fiscal 2025 and will support Jim and our other senior executives on merchandising-related strategies through March of 2027. Let's turn to our earnings results. As noted in today's press release, we are disappointed with our third-quarter sales results as business slowed from the solid gains we reported in the first half of 2024. Although our low to moderate-income customers continue to face persistently high costs on necessities, pressuring discretionary spending, we believe we should have better executed some of our merchandising initiatives. In addition, we estimate a combination of severe weather during the quarter from Hurricane Lane and Hilton, along with unseasonably warm temperatures, also negatively impacted comps by about one percent. Despite the below-planned sales results, earnings were ahead of our expectations. Operating margin for the quarter was up 75 basis points to 11.9% versus 11.2% last year, as lower incentive freight and distribution costs more than offset the planned decline in merchandise margin. Total sales for the period grew to $5.1 billion, up from $4.9 billion in the prior year, with comparable store sales up one percent. Earnings per share for the thirteen weeks ended November 2, 2024, were $1.48 compared to earnings per share of $1.33 last year. Net income for the period rose to $489 million versus $447 million in the prior year period. For the first nine months, earnings per share were $4.53 on net earnings of $1.5 billion compared to $3.74 per share on net income of $1.3 billion for the same period last year. Sales for the year-to-date period grew to $15.2 billion with comparable store sales up three percent over last year. For the third quarter, cosmetics, accessories, and children were the strongest merchandise areas, while California and Texas were the best-performing regions. Similar to the second quarter, DD's Discounts' strong value of fashion offerings continues to resonate with its shoppers, with comp gains exceeding Ross's results. At quarter-end, total consolidated inventories were up nine percent versus last year, while average store inventories were up one percent. Packaway merchandise represented 38% of total inventory compared to 39% last year. During the third quarter, we also completed our expansion program for 2024 with the addition of 43 new Ross and four DD's Discount stores. For the year, we added a total of 89 locations, comprised of 75 Ross and 14 DD's. We plan to close and/or relocate seven locations in the fourth quarter and expect to end the year with 1,831 Ross stores and 354 DD's Discount locations. Now Adam will provide further details on our third-quarter results and fourth-quarter guidance. Thank you, Adam. To sum up, we believe we have opportunities to improve our merchandise execution and remain confident that our ongoing focus and commitment to delivering the most will best position our company for profitable growth over the near and long term. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have. For Matt, the first opportunity to change is in the assortment. I think we had some execution issues in a couple of businesses that we've identified and that we think we can correct. We didn't probably move as quickly as we should have in some things where there were some, I would say, shifts in the world from a product perspective. So I feel like that's an opportunity and we missed some volume there. And also as we continue to iterate on our brand strategy and keep improving the brand strategy, listening to the customer and making those changes. So that continues. In terms of the fourth quarter and the acceleration and guidance to two to three, you know, as you get into the fourth quarter, many of the businesses that are really important during the holiday season, and I know you know this, whether it's gifting or cosmetics, you know, those businesses, accessories, have been strengths for us. So as we go into that period, we're going into some of our strongest businesses and also, you know, gifting last year in a lot of our home world was very good, and we're building on that. So I feel like those businesses, you know, should do well during the period. They're doing well now. And, you know, that gives us the confidence on the two to three. And, again, we'll continue to iterate on our other strategies in the remainder of the box and where we had some execution issues. We are in the process of, you know, fixing them. And, obviously, you know, we had some weather issues in Q3 that, you know, who knows what will happen from a weather perspective across the country for any of us. But we also had some of that. My areas of focus obviously will be to spend time with Jim and help him onboard. And to spend my time on merchandising. It will be an advisory role heavily focused on merchandising. I don't foresee any changes to our strategy because our brand strategy is really the key to our market share gains. I don't foresee that. And, you know, but it'll continue to iterate, and that's really where I will spend my time. Obviously, Jim is a very seasoned CEO. And he complements the strengths that we have in merchandising and our operational team. So I feel like Jim is a great add. And, you know, the team will be a good combination together and my role will be to make sure that merchandising continues going forward and that Jim gets transitioned appropriately. The execution issues are actually merchandise. I would say merchandise. This is not so much on the branding. However, you know, the brand strategy, we keep iterating on that and keep listening to the customers. We keep making changes as we go. So obviously and, you know, as we started this in the beginning, I said each business is at a different point at the starting point to where we are now. And so, you know, we keep responding to what the customer is telling us. So I would say that across the board will continue to do. And just some things we're just, yeah, execution issues, which we can fix. Okay. On the early customer acceptance of state of Ohio branches, you know, in many of these businesses, these are not major branches. Right? And so just want to emphasize, you know, that the friendship is good, better, best. All kinds of values and pricing moderate and above. And so in some businesses, the branches weren't that great because they were already at the, I would say, appropriate level that the customer is responding to and really likes, and so it is we didn't do it. In other areas, we felt like we needed to make bolder moves. And ladies, we felt like we needed to make bolder moves than we have. And so with again, we're at different journeys and different acceptance levels by the customer based on what the product is and the area that it is. So it's not just, you know, a straight line but I could say, hey. This is where we are completely on the journey. Some places, we feel that we're there. And in other places, we feel like we have a long road to go, and not a long road. That's probably the biggest question. You know, we have a ways to go with figuring out exactly what it is she wants. And that really tends to be more in our ladies' business. And as you know, ladies is a tougher business. And so we're learning. Merchants are shifting. As the customer is voting, and we want to get that right mix of, you know, right, brands that she likes. And a mix of good, better, best at the level that she enjoys, and we want to just make sure that the entire thing that we're giving compelling values there. Particularly in ladies as ladies is a tough business. Always compared to other parts of apparel. No. Not necessarily. It's not an AUR strategy. It's really a brand and value. So we're not going in and saying we want to raise AUR by x. We're putting out different brands at different levels in a good, better, best. And then it's seeking its own level with the customer. We can see what they like more than others and making adjustments as we go. Because for some businesses, they didn't have to make as big a move perhaps the ladies' business has to make. But it's not an AUR strategy. It's a value strategy. At all brands here so that we're addressing all the customer base. Right? So we have customers who like every price point, and we want to make sure that we fine-tune that so that we can consider that we can still, you know, give that treasure hunt experience to all customers. A store. So, you know, it's a learning and adjustment as we go, and we think that ladies will continue to improve as time goes on. And some other businesses are again, some are tweaked. And some are bigger moves. And the merchant team is very, very on this, and we are very focused on value. Because delivering compelling values is really the single most important thing we need to do. For our future in farm market checking. And in terms of the penetrations, I mean, you know, that's very it's hard to do your right. You can't do it at a global level. It's different by business, and so it's hard to do that. I think that the thing you know, as we started this whole brand thing, you know, and as I sit back and we've been talking about we've talked about brands, we always had brands in the store. I mean, our business model is to have brands. But what we realized is that in some getting surveys and feedback and everything, and in some areas, we needed more. What more is, you know, it is something that you can't I can't stick a number say, hey. This is what we're going to march to because the customer has to decide what that is. I think the most important thing for us to recognize and for everyone to recognize is that we're responding to what she says. Right? And so and then making changes to it. It's hard to just pick a it can't pick percent. Some areas, you know, if we were talking about an area like shoes, we would have said we, you know, we are highly branded. We're highly branded. You know, there weren't so many changes. So it just depends on what it is. I can't give you one number. And the other thing, it will seek its own level. And we'll know we'll know that we've got to like, in some businesses where we feel like we are where we want to be, you know, in some of those, we'll know. We'll know by the terms. We'll know by the markdown. We'll know by how quickly the merchandise is moving through the store and, you know, I think that's really the way to go, which is why it's kind of hard to just on a five. If we're going because the biggest mistake we can make with these is picking a number and just kind of really forging forward to a very large number that maybe is incorrect. So we started out with a number to begin. And we keep iterating again on what she's telling us. And that could be different by product, and it could be different by where I am in some of our business classification. And, Brooke, give me a favor. Give me more flavor around what you want as you're saying the customer engaging with the brand? You're just saying that is there any change in the macro or consumer engagement with your business as we've moved through the early holiday season outside of the weather events? I think when, you know, I think if we went through this third quarter. You know? I think, you know, it started the third quarter started off strong then weather came. And then obviously, as Michael said before, as the weather changed by region, we watched the consumer come back. So part of it is weather. And then, you know, there's a lot of shifts going on as holidays are coming earlier. This year. So I think part of it is just that. And I think, you know, an earlier Christmas, I think, might change a little bit of the dynamic to have a customer's gonna shop. You know, it's been a long time since we've had Christmas the week before. So but, yes, coming out of the weather, the customer did come back. Brooke, from a just a customer basis on whether an income basis or age basis. We did not in Q3. We haven't seen over time a significant shift on that basis either. And in terms of DD's, DD's has a strategy in place that they've been working on. And that'll just continue. So there won't be any other new strategies or additional changes. They'll just be building upon their successes. Well, in terms of inventory availability, you know, it's favorable. Again, some businesses have more availability than others. In terms of the impact of buying to Q3, I'm not sure I understand what you mean, Jay, by that. It's just that we have found that we were buying or just or that contribute to the quarter's performance? I'm not sure which one you want me to answer. No. I don't think that was part of the issue. And in fact, in seasonal businesses, you know, we leave money open, you know, things like outerwear or whatever because, you know, history would tell us that, you know, you don't know how it's going to start. And so with these merchants leave liquidity so that we don't get caught with that. So no. I don't think it has to do with the speed of what we bought or, you know, I think it's just some of the choices we made or didn't make and but it has nothing to do with that. It's really consumable, Marni. That's really their business is so big, and DD's does a business in consumable. But I think that's I think in what they have in there, I think that's probably to my point, that's probably the biggest overlap slash potential opportunity. And then on a good, better, best, you know, we turn put overall very quickly in the store. I mean, there's always some turn differential, but the overall churn on apparel is very fast. So think what we I would put it this way. We own the right fit to the right value. It all turns very quickly. If we own the wrong goods, it doesn't turn as quickly. So but overall, the entire box, you know, returns we drive receipts. It's our mission is to drive receipts not on inventory. So churn is always on our mind, but it's again it's about it's really about the value, putting on floor, the product and the value. It always comes back to the product and the value, and then it will turn quickly to the No. Within a treasure hunt environment, if I don't buy, it won't be there next. Okay. So responsibilities, you know, reporting to him will be two one twenty-five year plus veteran and the other thirty-year plus veteran. So I think from a merger perspective and tenure, and below that level, the group the average tenure is around twenty years below them. So I feel like I think that's fine. I actually think it's good. I think so he's got a very strong bench below him. That understands off-price and, you know, yeah. I mean, I'm very comfortable that the mix is good. And, actually, I think Jim complements some of the talent that we have in the organization. You know, in terms of timing, you know, look, a year and a half ago, when they're in June of 2023, you know, we announced internally, externally, you know, I was going to step down. And the agreement was that with the board that if we found the right person looking internally at externally, the whole thing. When we found the right person, that we would hire that person, I would move to an advisory role. So I don't know if it's necessarily the timing with where we are with this brand strategy. I think the single most important thing is to have the right person. And that to me is in the handoff. That's critical. Right? So I do. I think Jim is the right person. And so and, you know, obviously, there's a lot of tenure at Ross of people who've been here a long time, not only me, but Michael and Norman. You know, there's a lot of people here who've been here a long time. So you know, Jim will learn the business. But I don't it had nothing to do with, you know, we have our branch strategy. No. We're not going to when you find the right person, Lauren, you know. When it's right, it's right, and Jim is the right person. And so that really was a decision, and I was part of that decision. So I feel good about it. And clearly, we're going to make sure that Jim is successful because we have him, you know, pretty surrounded by true off-price veterans who have been doing it, you know, I'm getting older as I'm saying this to you, for years and years and years. But that's really what we've done. And that's really why the timing kind of, you know, it is earlier, but again, when you find the right person, I'm sure you've all done searches. Everyone on this call when you find the right person, you really have to, you know, really have to jump on I'm going to say jump on the opportunity being an off-price. The right so, you know, everything is opportunistic. And so I think the timing is good for the company and he'll be supported all along the way. Thank you for joining us today, and I hope everybody has a happy holiday."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously stated, comparable store sales rose one percent in the quarter. Operating margin increased 75 basis points to 11.9%. Cost of goods sold improved by 70 basis points in the quarter. Buying levered by 65 basis points mainly due to lower incentives while distribution and domestic freight costs declined by 50 and 40 basis points respectively. Occupancy rose by 25 basis points while merchandise margin decreased by 60 basis points. SG&A cost for the period improved by five basis points, primarily due to lower incentive costs. During the third quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our fourth-quarter guidance. For the thirteen weeks ending February 1, 2025, we continue to project comparable store sales to increase two percent to three percent. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter are planned to be in the range of $1.57 to $1.64, compared to $1.82 in the fourth quarter of 2023. This guidance range includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $0.03 per share primarily from the timing of packaway-related expenses that benefited the third quarter. Based on our year-to-date results and our fourth-quarter forecast, earnings per share for the fifty-two weeks ending February 1, 2025, are now expected to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.17 versus $5.56 last year. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter and full-year results included an extra week that benefited earnings by approximately $0.20. The operating statement assumptions that support our fourth-quarter guidance include the following. Total sales are projected to decline one percent to three percent. As a reminder, last year's extra week contributed $308 million to sales. We expect operating margin to be in the range of 11.2% to 11.5% versus 12.4% last year. Last year's fourth quarter included an 80 basis point benefit from the extra week. This outlook reflects lower merchandise margin, as we continue to increase the penetration of quality branded merchandise partially offset by lower incentive and freight expenses. Net interest income is expected to be approximately $24 million and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 329 million. Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments. And Matt, on your question on Q3 and Q4, I would start with merchandise margin. I mentioned it declined by 60 basis points in Q3. Now that result benefited from better-than-expected shrink results as we completed our physical inventory process and trued up our results in Q3. And then looking forward to Q4, probably an uptick in pressure for merchandise margin as we continue to push for more brands that are sharply priced to deliver the strong value proposition that we want for our customers in the holiday season. Domestic freight, we mentioned, was worth 40 basis points in Q3. I would expect that to be pretty consistent in Q4. I'll always caveat it with fuel costs, but assuming they stay where they are, I would expect that to be comparable. Distribution costs again were another source of strength for us. We mentioned the packaway shift that we have to take into account, so that'll put pressure on us in Q4. Incentives on both sides will continue to be favorable. We would expect in the fourth quarter as we're again up against a 2023 where we were outperforming in a significant way. And then lastly, obviously, we have the fifty-third week impact that we talked about. Yeah. On the domestic side, so we're forty basis points of improvement in Q3. Probably expect something similar in Q4. It's been tracking pretty consistently all year. On the ocean side, it was a negligible impact in the quarter. You know, in the short term, would expect that. Obviously, we're watching some of the potential disruptions and, you know, watching for the resolution of the strike issue that would impact the East Coast ports and the Gulf ports. So we're watching all those things. But with what we know right now, don't see that as anything other than neutral. And then we'll have to see as you know, we'll come back and talk to you at the beginning of the year on how we see 2025 and beyond. And once we get into the bidding process for next year."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Paul, on the shrink, we don't break out shrink separately. What I would say is we, and you know this covering us from over the years, is we completed our physical inventory in the third quarter. We had assumed that shrink was going to be worse for a couple of reasons. One, just the external landscape, but also the increased number of brands in the store. So what that meant is we accrued more going up to physical inventory. And so we took a larger benefit in Q3 that helped EBIT margin not only versus what we guided but versus last year. For the year, though, shrink looks like it's going to be about flat to 2023, again, with the upside in the third quarter. Your last question, Paul, was on the northeast. It's too early to comment on the overall store productivity, but we are pleased with what we've seen thus far. Lorraine, our expectation is that over time, as we build our brand relationships and as we learn what works best with our customer, that over time, it would be earnings accretion. And we'd expect slight improvements of margins over time. Sure. On the cadence during the quarter, comps were strongest early in the quarter as the weather became more difficult gradually as we moved through the quarter. We did see improvements in sell-throughs in markets when the weather became more seasonable. As we said in the commentary, the comps were driven by traffic. The other component of comp was relatively neutral. I'll start with your last question first. It's Michael. How we see our operating margins going forward, obviously, we have a model over time driven partly by new store growth, comp growth, which has historically been in the three percent to four percent range, and some operating margin improvement in the middle and then our share buyback. We have initiatives throughout the company whether it's technology investments, whether it's cost control, to be able to offset any impact to merchant margins. As I said though earlier, over the longer term, we believe that we can grow merchant margins from this base based on our vendor relationships as this gains traction and also we learn more about what the customer wants. It's Michael Hartshorn, I'll start with the DD's. First, it potentially is the DD's group and merchant have done a very nice job, and we're happy with the adjustments. We've been able to make in the DD's chain been able to improve our value and fashion offerings and it's resonated very well. With the customer and DD's outcome for us for the quarter. One other bright spot for DD's is the newer markets where we slowed growth have improved. But we need to see given that their sales volume started at levels below our expectations, we'll need to see sustained growth there before we ramp up new store growth in some of those newer markets. On the guidance, it hasn't changed. The only thing that's changed is packaway. On the guidance itself, first, the unfavorable weather had a negative impact on the third quarter that we're not expecting in the fourth quarter. We'll see how it plays out. As Barbara mentioned earlier, as we move into the fourth quarter, many of our merchandise areas that have been performing well are important fourth-quarter and holiday businesses. And then finally, the guides based, we feel good about our assortments. We have planned for the holiday, especially in gift-giving. Yeah. Michael, on the first piece. So our EPS beat, you know, we talked about merchandise margin coming in better, and expected related to shrink. I would say, we also felt good about just our overall cost management within the quarter. So multiple parts of the P&L benefiting. Now does that change our leverage point? No. We still think three to four percent comp growth is the right place for us to leverage. The shrink is obviously a one-time piece. Right? Because we true up in the third quarter as we always do, and then of course, the packaway is one-time in nature. So I think the only other moving part that we haven't talked about, our EPS benefited by higher interest income. That, you know, that embedded in our guidance is some pressure, you know, assuming further rate cuts. The balance of the year. Dana, on the tariffs, we'll be closely monitoring any developments there, I'm sure everybody across the industry is doing so. It's too early to say what the potential impact could be on us and the rest of retail. Our focus in the case of a tariff increase would be to maintain a pricing umbrella versus traditional retailers and offer the best values to the customer. We will not be a leader in raising prices. Yeah. I don't have the exact number of stores. Obviously, smaller footprint, a lot more consumables than what we have. In DD's? So I would say it's hard to see any impact. Very different merchandise mix. So could there be some upside potentially, but given what's in the box, I don't see it as a huge upside. Aneesha, on the weather, yes. We did. And I said previously, we did see improvements in sell-throughs in markets where weather became more seasonal within Q3. Sure, John. I'd say overall, we feel good about what we have and, you know, the real estate landscape. And we have a healthy pipeline for the next couple of years. I would say, you know, real estate is tight. There's not a lot of new centers being constructed. And for us, there's increased interest from other retailers and the types of real estates that we typically prefer. That said, you know, we have a very strong team that has a methodical process of developing a healthy real estate pipeline to support our growth plans over the next number of years."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations, the future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of the future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and in the company's fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and fiscal 2024 Form 10-Q and 8-Ks on file with the SEC. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer.\nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group's President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2024 results, followed by our outlook for the second half and full fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, second quarter sales and earnings were above our expectations as our stronger value offerings resonated with our customers. Operating margin improved versus last year, increasing 115 basis points to 12.5%. Total sales for the period grew 7% to $5.3 billion, up from $4.9 billion last year with comparable store sales up 4%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 were $1.59 on net income of $527 million. These results are up from $1.32 per share on net earnings of $446 million in last year's second quarter. For the first six months, earnings per share were $3.05 on net income of $1 billion. These results compare to earnings per share of $2.41 on net earnings of $818 million for the first half of 2023. Sales for the 2024 year-to-date period grew to $10.1 billion, up from $9.4 billion in the prior year. Comparable sales for the first half of 2024 were up 3%. Cosmetics and Children's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while geographic performance was broad-based. Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS performance also improved as shoppers responded favorably to the stronger values and fashions offered in stores. In addition, dd's faced easier compares versus last year, benefiting their recent performance. While we are encouraged by the improved trends, we continue to adjust assortments in the newer markets to address this more diverse customer base. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 8% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 3% due to the 53rd week calendar shift. Packaway merchandise for 39% of total inventories at quarter end, up slightly from 38% last year. Turning to store growth. We opened 21 New Rock and three dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 90 new locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 4% for the quarter, driven by a combination of higher traffic and basket size. Second quarter operating margin of 12.5% was up 115 basis points over 11.3% last year. Our improved profitability benefited from higher sales and lower distribution and incentive costs that were partially offset as planned by lower merchandise margins. Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 60 basis points. Distribution and buying costs delivered by 70 and 55 basis points, respectively, while domestic freight costs declined by 15 basis points. As expected, merchandise margin decreased by 80 basis points. SG&A for the period improved by 55 basis points, mainly due to higher sales and lower incentive costs. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. As a result, we remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. As Barbara noted in today's press release, our low to moderate income customers continue to face high cost on necessities, pressuring their discretionary spending. Looking ahead, our prior year sales comparisons also become more challenging during the second half of the year amidst an external environment that is highly uncertain. As a result, we continue to maintain a cautious approach in forecasting our sales. For both the third and fourth quarters, we are planning comparable sales growth of 2% to 3% on top of 5% and 7% gains, respectively, in 2023. If sales perform in line with this guidance, third quarter earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.41 versus $1.33 last year and $1.60 to $1.67 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.82 in 2023. This updated earnings guidance now reflects additional efficiencies we expect to achieve in the second half of 2024. If the second half performs in line with these projections, earnings per share for the full year are now forecast to be in the range of $6 to $6.13, up from $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, both the 2023, fourth quarter and full year results included an approximate $0.20 per share benefit from the 53rd week. Now, let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2024. Total sales are forecast to increase 3% to 5% versus the prior year. We expect to open 47 stores during the quarter, including 43 Ross and 4 dd's locations. Operating margin for the 2024 third quarter is planned to be in the 10.9% to 11.2% range, compared to 11.2% in 2023. This outlook reflects lower incentive, freight and distribution costs that are offset by lower merchandise margins as we build on our efforts to offer more sharply priced branded bargains. Net interest income is estimated to be approximately $39 million. The tax rate is projected to be 24% to 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $331 million. Now, I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. While second quarter sales and earnings were above our expectations, we remain keenly aware of the uncertain external environment. In addition, we recognize that delivering the great values that our off-price customers have come to expect from us is more important than ever, especially given the continued pressures they face from the highest cost on necessities. Thus, we will stay laser-focused on maximizing our prospects for market share gains by providing shoppers with the most quality branded bargains in the marketplace. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting the question-and-session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Boss: Great. Thanks and congrats on a really nice quarter. So Barbara, could you elaborate on the progression of business trends that you saw during the quarter? And just progress with your initiatives to amplify value, as well as brands into the back half of the year? And then for Adam, on gross margin, could you just maybe speak to the mark on opportunity based on current availability of goods or how best to think about gross margin drivers in the back half?\nMichael Hartshorn: Matt, I'll start with comp performance during the quarter. Cadence-wise for us, comps were strongest mid-quarter, both on a single year and a multiyear stack basis.\nBarbara Rentler: And then in terms of progress on the value strategy, the stronger value offering is definitely resonating with our customers. So in the fall season, we're going to continue to build on improving that value offering that we have out there now. And again, I just said it in my opening, the customer is really dealing with high cost on necessities. And I think the way for us to gain market share is really to continue down this value path.\nAdam Orvos: And Matt, this is Adam. I know your question about the balance of the year and mark on specifically. So let me just walk you through some of the parts. So, we talked about DC cost leverage by 70 basis points in the quarter. We continue to see higher productivity in our distribution centers. We've invested in automation there. The hiring and retention environment is strong. We opened a newer DC in Houston that's providing a lift. Buying costs were also favorable, but lower incentives were the primary factor there. And then domestic freight, as we expected was a slight benefit to us and ocean freight was neutral regarding mark on specifically. So the pressure to all of that is our merchandise margin, right? We voiced about our brand strategy that continues to ramp up as we move through the year and merchandise margin dropped by 80 basis points, and we expect that pressure to step up as we move into the second half -- second half of the year.\nMatthew Boss: Great color. Congrats again.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Please proceed with your question.\nChuck Grom: Thanks, very much. Great quarter. I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the cadence, talk about anything on the back-to-school results thus far. And also within categories, if you could speak to the home and also where you are on the apparel trends in the quarter? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. It's Michael Hartshorn. The cadence wise, we wouldn't say any -- we wouldn't talk about inter-quarter trends going into Q3. But as I said, comps were strongest mid-quarter for us. In terms of merchandise categories, Cosmetics and Children's were the strongest areas while Home performed in line with the chain. Shoes were slightly below as it lapped tough compares from last year. And then overall, Apparel was relatively in line with the chain average.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Altschwager: Good afternoon. Thank you taking my question. So just thinking about the updated guide here, you beat the high end of your EPS guide by $0.10 in the quarter. I think you're raising the high end for the full year to $0.15. Second half comp still in that 2% to 3% range. So maybe just talk us through any key changes to the operating outlook for the back half of the year, key margin drivers for the back half versus what you were expecting 90 days ago? I think you mentioned some additional efficiencies, maybe expand on that and just anything else you can call out? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. On the -- nothing has really changed on the back half of the year versus how we originally planned the year. The one thing that did change, you'll notice for the quarter, we did flow through the beat in the second quarter through the year. And then based on some of the expense initiatives and cost savings initiatives, we gave an updated view of the efficiencies across the business. We're continuously looking for ways to be more productive, but it's even more important given the planned merchandise margin pressure from our branded strategy. So what you see is, we had a projection when we started the year, we're actually a bit ahead of that, and we flowed that through the back half guidance.\nMark Altschwager: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Lejuez: Thanks, guys. I think you said basket was up, curious if you could maybe talk about AUR versus UPT? Also curious if you could share where you are right now on a dollar basis? What is the current AUR in the business, current basket size? And then second, just curious, I know you said your customer is under pressure, but I'm wondering if you noticed any change in your customer behavior in the second quarter versus the first quarter or how you were thinking your customer might behave when you gave guidance originally? Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Paul. First, on the AUR for the quarter, the comp was driven by a combination of higher traffic and a higher basket. The average basket was slightly up as average unit retails were partially offset by fewer items per transaction. On the AUR, we're not focused on driving specific price points, but rather we're focused on offering a good, better -- good, better, best product assortment at a great value. We don't give specifics on the actual AUR or the basket. In terms of health of the consumer, I would say, based on our performance since it improved in the second quarter, what I would say, though, for us, it's obviously \u2013 we saw an improvement. But judging from industry reports, both in the first quarter and now year-to-date, the customer is clearly seeking value now, especially with, what I\u2019d say, stubbornly persistent inflation on necessities and also an uncertain macro economy. As a result, now more than ever, we believe price value is critical for her when determining where to shop.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: And did I hear right thing that AUR was up a little bit, UPT is down?\nA \u2013 Michael Hartshorn: Yes, correct.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: But can you just maybe tie that together with the focus on value, providing the customer more value. Is there a mix impact to that AUR? Just curious what would explain it being higher as you offer more value?\nA \u2013 Michael Hartshorn: Sure, Paul. It\u2019s about \u2013 it aligns with our branded strategy. Again, we\u2019re focused on providing more brands at a great value, and that\u2019s led to the slight increase in AUR.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Binetti: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our question. Congrats on a great quarter. I guess just on the -- maybe you could unpack that merch margin for us a little bit more. I thought at one point that the pure product margin was planned to have the most year-over-year pressure in the second quarter, since I think you started rolling out some of the merchandise strategy in the back half of last year. I know you do include promotion in that line. So maybe just unpack that a little bit for us. And if that your product margin pressure is better or worse as you get into the second half? And then separately, I know you always speak to about a point of upside on the same-store sales, driving about 10 or 15 basis points of leverage. I think you guys got about 70 basis points on the 1 point beat to the top end there. Maybe you could break down the contributors there to the favorability and maybe any thoughts on why that wouldn't continue in the back half? Or if you do think if there is a better flow-through opportunity?\nMichael Hartshorn: Just to start with the flow-through. The upside was obviously driven by sales. And to your point, that's about 10 to 15 basis points for every point in sale. But we also saw a better improvement on some of the expense initiatives and cost initiatives we have in the business. And so based on that, that's the upside that we forecasted in the back half of the year.\nAdam Orvos: Yes, Michael, this is Adam. I'll jump in on the margin side of the question, right? We did start our efforts at the end of last year, but really the step-up was this year, right? And that's why you saw gradual pressure in Q1. We were about 15 bps worse than the prior year, but some of that, we still had some residual ocean freight benefit that was helping that number in Q1. We reported the 80 basis points in Q2. And as I mentioned, as we continue to increase that penetration of brands and going after more brands, we'll see additional pressure in the back half.\nMichael Binetti: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Straton: Great. Thanks all for taking the question. Congrats on a nice quarter. Just on expense and cost savings that you say you're finding and you expect more in the back half. Can you just give us a little bit more color around some examples of what those are? And are they more COGS benefits or SG&A benefits or both? Thanks a lot.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. Just to talk through, I guess, a couple of examples. We're certainly leveraging automation in the DCs. We continue to make improvements there, and throughout the business, including DCs and stores. Just to give you a couple of examples in the DCs. We've implemented automated vehicles to move inventory, robots to build cartons as well as automated systems to sort inventory to the stores -- at the store, which would be an SG&A and not COGS. We have a number of things to augment the work for associates. We piloted self-checkout in select locations. We have introduced new handheld devices to check inventory, to take markdowns into managed tasks and stores and are currently rolling out flexible scheduling that will help us be more productive in the stores.\nAdam Orvos: And Alex, building on that a bit, we've found efficiencies in multiple parts of the P&L. I'd probably speak to domestic freight as being one primary example, where given what we're seeing from our rate structure and our contracted rates, a little bit of help from fuel costs. We thought it made sense to flow that through specifically in the back half.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you quantify the merchandise margin decline that you're expecting in the second half? And are there additional operating efficiencies available to offset any further merch margin pressure into next year?\nAdam Orvos: Lorraine, this is Adam. We're not quantifying the amount of the merchandise margin impact other than just saying it will -- we expect it to be higher than the 80 basis points that we reported in Q2. I think, offsets that we'll have in the back half, I just commented on domestic freight. That's probably the primary category. Michael touched on distribution cost and our improvement there. That would be another category. As we've experienced so far in the first half, because we're up against still a significant year from a profitability standpoint. So we expect to have -- with these projections, some good news in incentive costs as we move into the back half, I would say those are probably the biggest moving parts in terms of offsets to the merchandise margin.\nMichael Hartshorn: And Lorraine, it's at this point, too early to talk about 2025. We're just starting to go through our budget process for next year.\nLorraine Hutchinson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good afternoon everyone. As you think about the ladies business, the home business, any updates on their performance and your focus, Barbara, on brands in each of those businesses? And in mind of this focus on value, how are you thinking about pricing as we move forward into the back half of the year? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: Sure. So on the ladies business, we're obviously -- that's one of our focuses in terms of shifting our assortments, getting more branded, adding more values because the ladies business, as you know, is critical to the entire business. So again, we've learned -- we keep learning as we're going, adding a lot of new vendors, trying different values. And so, that's just going to kind of continue ladies and we're going to adjust as we need to as we go. The value equation, I would -- we've got value in pricing. When we talk value on pricing, I'm most afraid to say it. So our focus in all of it is on the value. The value compared to out the door and other retailers, the value, depending upon what segment I'm in, whether I promotional department store or [indiscernible], we're focused on the value not so much the price. In home, the home business isn't as branded obviously in the outside world as ladies or men's or even kids for example. So in the home business, we're really more focused on specific businesses where it is branded in the outside world. So we want to make sure that we're -- again, we have a good compare when you're comparing against a brand. We'd be able to have a good compare so that we could go in and show again -- show really incredible value to the customer because the value strategy is our market share strategy. I mean, where we're figuring it out and every business is at different points in the process. But what we figuring it out is, it is really driving sales. So we're just going to continue to do it. In terms of absolute pricing, we're not really planning an AUR. We're really planning a value. Now with that, we will have good, better, best brands in the assortment because we don't want to alienate any customers. So we want to make sure we still have a broad assortment of price points, where we have a broad assortment of products in the stores. So we don't want to lose that because that's an important part of the treasure hunt. But in terms of absolute pricing, as Michael said before, we're not planning specific AUR. So really looking at the outside world and comparing that. Recognizing in front of us, we can see now as retailers are reporting their sales and talking about promoting going forward. We'll run through that same drill the merchants do all the time, competitive shop, track outdoor pricing, out-the-door pricing and follow that same path. But it really -- it really is a value strategy. You want her to come in and to feel like she got a really an incredible deal every day of the week. So again, different businesses at different points in the journey, but that's kind of where we are at this moment.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBrooke Roach: Good afternoon and thank you for taking our question. Barbara, can you talk to the level and quality of inventory available in the marketplace today? Are you seeing any additional opportunities for new vendor partnerships. And are you seeing inventory opportunities come in at a better mark on rate for margins? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: So in terms of just inventory availability, the ability remains favorable. It's pretty broad-based, as I would normally say some businesses having more than others, but it's still out there. In terms of quality itself. One is just availability. One is the quality of availability. Again, it's kind of in all the brands here of products that there are. Brooke, what was the second question you said?\nBrooke Roach: Whether or not you're getting new vendors?\nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Yes. In terms of vendors, vendors are -- first of all, we're out expanding on our vendor base. That's one part of our adding value into the mix. Vendors are -- we're definitely adding new vendors to answer your question, and vendors are actually with business being challenging, particularly in certain segments of the market, vendors are looking to build relationships and to do more business. And so with that, obviously, cost price as a sector is certainly a sector that is continuing to do more business. And so, I would say we're -- from that -- the total package together, we're probably in the right place at the right time in terms of going out to add new vendors and to build out these relationships.\nOperator: And the next question will come from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Drbul: Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions, quick ones. Can you talk a little bit about shrink and sort of how it's performing within your business? And -- just wondering if you could comment on California stores and just sort of how they're doing versus the chain? And I guess the third one that I'd be curious about, just like labor and wage rates and wage pressures that you're seeing throughout your chain? Thanks.\nMichael Hartshorn: Sure. So let me -- I'll take all of these. So shrink, let's start with shrink. It continues to be what I'd say, a very difficult retail theft environment, and we're certainly not immune to that. We have and we'll continue to invest in loss prevention initiatives to hold that shrink at bay. But frankly, we're also focused on our own execution of the measures we do have in place today. We will true-up shrink in the third quarter, and our guidance at this point assumes some deterioration from last year. On comps geographically. So for -- as we said in the commentary, geographic was fairly broad-based. For our largest market, California outperformed the chain, while Florida was in line, Texas was slightly below the chain average, and that was partially due to the impact from Hurricane Beryl that rolled through during the quarter. On wages, I would say, generally speaking, wages in our stores and DCs are relatively stable. Most of the wage increases this year have been related to statutory wage increases in certain markets and states. And so, what you see from us is most of the wage, we'll continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing and where appropriate, we'll adjust wages if we need to. You heard Adam talked earlier about productivity in the DCs, part of that productivity improvement is due to a very stable labor market in the DC sector, which means lower turnover for us and more productivity from the more tenured associates.\nRobert Drbul: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAdrienne Yih: Great. Thank you very much. Let me add my congratulations. Barbara, I was wondering if you can talk about just what you're seeing in your target consumer behavioral patterns. Obviously, we've heard a lot that things are going back to kind of pre-pandemic, the highs when the traffic days are very high, the lows are a little bit quieter, buying closer to need. If you can talk a little bit about that. And then as the promotional or the environment gets more promotional at retail, is your strategy to be even -- to maintain the spread, your historical spread? Or do you want to get a little bit even sharper still to be able to drive incremental market share gains? Thank you.\nMichael Hartshorn: On the traffic patterns, we haven't seen a significant change. Certainly, the events are more important. But as far as traffic during the quarter or during the week or during the weekends or towards events. We haven't seen a significant shift.\nBarbara Rentler: And as the environment gets more promotional, we don't have a, I would say, a standard historical spread. What the merchants do is, they're outcome shopping they're seeing what's going on, they're monitoring what's happening. And sometimes when you're doing that, you have to also anticipate where you think a retailer is going to go and especially going to [indiscernible]. But -- so we don't have a historical read. We're going to price it as sharply as we possibly can price it. So we're going to look at that. We're going to make those decisions -- educated decisions. But with that, we're seeing that this value strategy is really the path for us. So we'll do it, obviously, the way we have historically done in terms of process and then be setting the value that we think is really strong.\nAdrienne Yih: And then one clarifying question on the AUR and the branded aspect of it, how much more branded product do you have -- however you want to characterize it, this year over the last. And the AUR on the brands is higher, but are the merch margins relatively flat? Are they lower just because it's branded product? I'm just curious how the -- what the merch margin match the AUR direction? Thank you.\nAdam Orvos: Adrienne, this is Adam. I'll jump in. We wouldn't speak to kind of the mix of our business, how much is branded and non-branded. But the merchandise margin pressure that I spoke to is all related to the brand strategy and that step-up in penetration.\nAdrienne Yih: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. Very helpful. Best of luck.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nIrwin Boruchow: Hi, everyone. Just a quick question, I guess, for me on the branded strategy. Clearly, it's successful. The comps you guys have been up late last year and early this year are pretty robust. I guess just at a high level, I know you're not going to give us your plans for 2025 and beyond. But is this a strategy that has multiyear duration? Is this more of a strategy that you kind of unlock it, you just let it ride as it is? I'm just kind of curious is there a step functions to it as we kind of move forward in terms of mix without quantifying that? So just at a high level, I would be curious.\nBarbara Rentler: I think we're still learning on the brand strategy. What the right mix, what the right penetrations are by business. So I don't think we could quite answer that today. Obviously, our goal is to drive top line sales. But we got a lot of learning so far. We had a lot of learnings in spring. I'm sure we'll have more learnings for fall. And we're going to build off the success of those learnings based on what the customer is telling us.\nIrwin Boruchow: Got it. Thanks, Barbara.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. Please proceed with your question.\nMarni Shapiro: Hi, guys, congratulations on the quarter. I was curious if we can talk about the kids business for a minute. The assortments have looked really good in the stores, especially some of the [indiscernible] assortments, which has been tough. Is the -- are the recent trends inclusive of back-to-school. And if not, is -- can you give us any kind of side line into what back-to-school look like in August? And then I know you talked about customers not changing their behavior or not buying closer to need. I'm curious if you're seeing any delay in their purchasing on big seasonal items like a back-to-school or seasonal holidays like July 4 or Halloween or anything like that? Thank you.\nBarbara Rentler: Okay. First of all, thank you for the compliment on Kids, [indiscernible]. Look, at this point, we're not going to talk about back-to-school because clearly, we're still in it. So there's still some in front of us as we go. In terms of delays in purchasing, I mean, you know there were some slight calendar timing shift. What I would say in terms of I'm buying it ware now, I'm buying some stuff ware now like [indiscernible] short scenario. I'm going to buy a new [indiscernible] to get to go back to school in. I think we've seen that go on for a couple of years now. I think you have to [indiscernible] mix and make a conversion. So I think actually, if we would use that example of short -- denim shorts and long denim, they're actually both performing pretty well. And I think that has to do perhaps with the balance of the amount that we actually own. But kids still go back to school and shorts need that kind of that one last set and then the trick is to get [indiscernible] too much.\nMarni Shapiro: Great. And too early to tell on things like July 4, did they buy [indiscernible] blue, very late or Halloween you're not seeing a change there. How people come into the store. And sometimes in the past, I feel like we've seen customers buy really far in advance of holidays. But lately, I've been hearing from -- seeing just in stores that there's more of like a mad rush the week before whatever that event is, if that makes sense?\nBarbara Rentler: So you're saying, Halloween had sold much earlier three years ago than itself today. I think it depends on what the events this morning. I think certain things -- certain holidays can sell early and go all the way through and then some people, it's not quite as top of line and buy it at the end. But that moves -- that can move the year-to-year. I'm not quite frankly, that also has a lot to do with the assortment that you put on the floor, how good it is whether it's....\nMarni Shapiro: Yes. That make sense. Best of luck with fall, guys.\nAdam Orvos: Thank you\nMichael Hartshorn: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Kernan: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. So Adam, when you think about the long-term margin potential of the business, there's been some tremendous flow-through on the three comp in Q1 and now the four comp in Q2. To the bottom line, how do you think about the long-term operating margin structure of the business? You've been as high as 14% in the past. Obviously, there's been a lot of wage inflation and supply chain inflation. I'm just wondering what's the ceiling for this business from a long-term margin perspective?\nAdam Orvos: John, I'd say nothing's changed, right? We still think an additional point of comp gives us 10 to 15 basis points of margin expansion and that really hasn't changed. The long term -- where do we get to long term, we need to keep on delivering outsized comp sales gains. That's really going to be the primary driver, right? And then there's -- I guess, the other variable is, how does some of the inflationary pieces play out? What if fuel rates look like long term, et cetera, is probably the biggest moving part coupled with wages. And do they continue to stay in somewhat of a stabilized environment. So those are probably the biggest things from a long-term standpoint.\nJohn Kernan: That makes sense. Just a quick follow-up. There's been a fair amount of immigration in the last several years. You've got a lot of stores in some of those border states. Have you seen a customer seeking value and benefited from that population growth in a lot of those states?\nMichael Hartshorn: Specifically, as it relates to border stores, I mean, California and Texas have gone back and forth as being strong, strong drivers of growth over the years. You saw in the quarter, for instance, California outperformed, Texas underperformed. It's kind of been like that over the past few years. Certainly, we do very well on the border with cross-border traffic that's some of our best and highest volume stores, but immigration specifically, I don't think we could point to across broad swaps of the regions.\nJohn Kernan: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you and congrats on the good quarter. So Barbara, last quarter, you talked about apparel having underperformed for a while. Now it's in line with chain. As you go into Q3, are you happy now with where you are on the brand's assortment? Or do you see continued progress even in season between Q3 and Q4 as you get through the back half of the year? And then I have a quick follow-up, Adam or Michael, on the incentive comp. You've now beat plan for two quarters. Based on your current raised guidance for the back half, do you expect to still see incentive accruals benefit in the back half? Or do you see that benefit gradually moderating based on the performance so far? Thanks.\nBarbara Rentler: In terms of apparel underperformance and now apparel being in line with the chain, apparel is in line with the chain. Ladies, however, is still below the chain average. So in all the areas, we're expecting to see more progress in apparel as the year goes on. So we're building upon the learnings, building upon the things that the customer is voting for. And so I think that's going to be for the next six months for all it takes us to really truly understand it. But in grand total, it was in line. But as you know, Children's outperformed. So Ladies underperformed.\nAdam Orvos: And Aneesha, on the incentive piece, with the guidance that we're providing, we would still expect to see some incentive benefits. So again, it's we're going up year in 2023 where we significantly exceeded our financial plans, while we feel good about how we're tracking. We're up against a really outsized year.\nAneesha Sherman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nCorey Tarlowe: Great. Thanks. Barbara, I think you mentioned in response to a prior question that you're expanding the number of vendors that you have. Is there any way to put into historical context what the amount of new vendors you're adding might look like versus history? And if there's any incremental buying expense or people that you had to bring on to accommodate that?\nBarbara Rentler: I mean -- I really -- I can't give you a specific number. And quite frankly, when it comes to vendors, some vendors go out of business, some people go in business or adding more vendors. So it's really hard for me to quantify to -- quantify that for you.\nCorey Tarlowe: Okay. Understood. And then just as it relates to shoes, is there any way you could talk about within the category, what you saw in lifestyle or athletic shoes versus brown shoes perhaps?\nBarbara Rentler: Sure. First of all, shoes underperformed the chain, but was up against a very, very large comp. I think it was a little mixed on the way into the season. Athletic overall has been pretty good. As has active meet certainly some brands better than others. But overall, athletic and active has been good. It's been a little bit more mixed on brown shoes depending upon for woman\u2019s, ladies or kids. But we did see the run-up in flat handles, we did see block yields. We did see the sandal things take off. And we're a little bit more strategic in our transition as we're going into fall because last year we slowed foots early. And they did not perform early. And this year, we made a shift in timing.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Jay Sole with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJay Sole: Great. Thank you. My question is about international. Some of your competitors have talked about maybe doing deals or they have announced deals with off-price retailers in international markets. Have you explored that? I mean what are your thoughts about Ross expanding into international markets?\nMichael Hartshorn: Good question. I wouldn't comment on the deals. But for us, we have -- we're a 2,100 stores. We think we can grow 2,900 Ross, 700 dd's, plenty of room to grow in the U.S., and our focus is on growing that store base profitably over the next number of years. So that's where we're putting our energy and our focus.\nJay Sole: Okay. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking my question. You called out additional efficiencies benefiting your EPS guide in the back half and then gave some examples of those. How long is the tail there? Meaning, is this part of a longer-term program that will benefit earnings and margins into next year? Or should we just see the positive benefit of lapping in the first half and then it flattens out?\nMichael Hartshorn: I'd answer that in a couple of different ways. First, these are -- they're not -- there's a number of initiatives and they all have different timing. Some will go into next year, some will help us in the next year. Some will run out this year. But then we have the next generation of efficiencies that we'll work on for next year as well. As we said, long term, we think we can continue to gradually grow EBIT margin at a 3% to 4% comp, and that hasn't changed.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no more questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments.\nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group's President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our second quarter 2024 results, followed by our outlook for the second half and full fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As noted in today's press release, second quarter sales and earnings were above our expectations as our stronger value offerings resonated with our customers. Operating margin improved versus last year, increasing 115 basis points to 12.5%. Total sales for the period grew 7% to $5.3 billion, up from $4.9 billion last year with comparable store sales up 4%. Earnings per share for the 13 weeks ended August 3, 2024 were $1.59 on net income of $527 million. These results are up from $1.32 per share on net earnings of $446 million in last year's second quarter. For the first six months, earnings per share were $3.05 on net income of $1 billion. These results compare to earnings per share of $2.41 on net earnings of $818 million for the first half of 2023. Sales for the 2024 year-to-date period grew to $10.1 billion, up from $9.4 billion in the prior year. Comparable sales for the first half of 2024 were up 3%. Cosmetics and Children's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter, while geographic performance was broad-based. Like Ross, dd's DISCOUNTS performance also improved as shoppers responded favorably to the stronger values and fashions offered in stores. In addition, dd's faced easier compares versus last year, benefiting their recent performance. While we are encouraged by the improved trends, we continue to adjust assortments in the newer markets to address this more diverse customer base. At quarter end, total consolidated inventories were up 8% versus last year, while average store inventories were up 3% due to the 53rd week calendar shift. Packaway merchandise for 39% of total inventories at quarter end, up slightly from 38% last year. Turning to store growth. We opened 21 New Rock and three dd's DISCOUNT locations in the second quarter. We remain on track to open a total of approximately 90 new locations this year comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. Now, Adam will provide further details on our second quarter results and additional color on our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Thank you, Adam. While second quarter sales and earnings were above our expectations, we remain keenly aware of the uncertain external environment. In addition, we recognize that delivering the great values that our off-price customers have come to expect from us is more important than ever, especially given the continued pressures they face from the highest cost on necessities. Thus, we will stay laser-focused on maximizing our prospects for market share gains by providing shoppers with the most quality branded bargains in the marketplace. At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. And then in terms of progress on the value strategy, the stronger value offering is definitely resonating with our customers. So in the fall season, we're going to continue to build on improving that value offering that we have out there now. And again, I just said it in my opening, the customer is really dealing with high cost on necessities. And I think the way for us to gain market share is really to continue down this value path. Sure. So on the ladies business, we're obviously -- that's one of our focuses in terms of shifting our assortments, getting more branded, adding more values because the ladies business, as you know, is critical to the entire business. So again, we've learned -- we keep learning as we're going, adding a lot of new vendors, trying different values. And so, that's just going to kind of continue ladies and we're going to adjust as we need to as we go. The value equation, I would -- we've got value in pricing. When we talk value on pricing, I'm most afraid to say it. So our focus in all of it is on the value. The value compared to out the door and other retailers, the value, depending upon what segment I'm in, whether I promotional department store or [indiscernible], we're focused on the value not so much the price. In home, the home business isn't as branded obviously in the outside world as ladies or men's or even kids for example. So in the home business, we're really more focused on specific businesses where it is branded in the outside world. So we want to make sure that we're -- again, we have a good compare when you're comparing against a brand. We'd be able to have a good compare so that we could go in and show again -- show really incredible value to the customer because the value strategy is our market share strategy. I mean, where we're figuring it out and every business is at different points in the process. But what we figuring it out is, it is really driving sales. So we're just going to continue to do it. In terms of absolute pricing, we're not really planning an AUR. We're really planning a value. Now with that, we will have good, better, best brands in the assortment because we don't want to alienate any customers. So we want to make sure we still have a broad assortment of price points, where we have a broad assortment of products in the stores. So we don't want to lose that because that's an important part of the treasure hunt. But in terms of absolute pricing, as Michael said before, we're not planning specific AUR. So really looking at the outside world and comparing that. Recognizing in front of us, we can see now as retailers are reporting their sales and talking about promoting going forward. We'll run through that same drill the merchants do all the time, competitive shop, track outdoor pricing, out-the-door pricing and follow that same path. But it really -- it really is a value strategy. You want her to come in and to feel like she got a really an incredible deal every day of the week. So again, different businesses at different points in the journey, but that's kind of where we are at this moment. So in terms of just inventory availability, the ability remains favorable. It's pretty broad-based, as I would normally say some businesses having more than others, but it's still out there. In terms of quality itself. One is just availability. One is the quality of availability. Again, it's kind of in all the brands here of products that there are. Brooke, what was the second question you said? Sure. Yes. In terms of vendors, vendors are -- first of all, we're out expanding on our vendor base. That's one part of our adding value into the mix. Vendors are -- we're definitely adding new vendors to answer your question, and vendors are actually with business being challenging, particularly in certain segments of the market, vendors are looking to build relationships and to do more business. And so with that, obviously, cost price as a sector is certainly a sector that is continuing to do more business. And so, I would say we're -- from that -- the total package together, we're probably in the right place at the right time in terms of going out to add new vendors and to build out these relationships. And as the environment gets more promotional, we don't have a, I would say, a standard historical spread. What the merchants do is, they're outcome shopping they're seeing what's going on, they're monitoring what's happening. And sometimes when you're doing that, you have to also anticipate where you think a retailer is going to go and especially going to [indiscernible]. But -- so we don't have a historical read. We're going to price it as sharply as we possibly can price it. So we're going to look at that. We're going to make those decisions -- educated decisions. But with that, we're seeing that this value strategy is really the path for us. So we'll do it, obviously, the way we have historically done in terms of process and then be setting the value that we think is really strong. I think we're still learning on the brand strategy. What the right mix, what the right penetrations are by business. So I don't think we could quite answer that today. Obviously, our goal is to drive top line sales. But we got a lot of learning so far. We had a lot of learnings in spring. I'm sure we'll have more learnings for fall. And we're going to build off the success of those learnings based on what the customer is telling us. Okay. First of all, thank you for the compliment on Kids, [indiscernible]. Look, at this point, we're not going to talk about back-to-school because clearly, we're still in it. So there's still some in front of us as we go. In terms of delays in purchasing, I mean, you know there were some slight calendar timing shift. What I would say in terms of I'm buying it ware now, I'm buying some stuff ware now like [indiscernible] short scenario. I'm going to buy a new [indiscernible] to get to go back to school in. I think we've seen that go on for a couple of years now. I think you have to [indiscernible] mix and make a conversion. So I think actually, if we would use that example of short -- denim shorts and long denim, they're actually both performing pretty well. And I think that has to do perhaps with the balance of the amount that we actually own. But kids still go back to school and shorts need that kind of that one last set and then the trick is to get [indiscernible] too much. So you're saying, Halloween had sold much earlier three years ago than itself today. I think it depends on what the events this morning. I think certain things -- certain holidays can sell early and go all the way through and then some people, it's not quite as top of line and buy it at the end. But that moves -- that can move the year-to-year. I'm not quite frankly, that also has a lot to do with the assortment that you put on the floor, how good it is whether it's.... In terms of apparel underperformance and now apparel being in line with the chain, apparel is in line with the chain. Ladies, however, is still below the chain average. So in all the areas, we're expecting to see more progress in apparel as the year goes on. So we're building upon the learnings, building upon the things that the customer is voting for. And so I think that's going to be for the next six months for all it takes us to really truly understand it. But in grand total, it was in line. But as you know, Children's outperformed. So Ladies underperformed. I mean -- I really -- I can't give you a specific number. And quite frankly, when it comes to vendors, some vendors go out of business, some people go in business or adding more vendors. So it's really hard for me to quantify to -- quantify that for you. Sure. First of all, shoes underperformed the chain, but was up against a very, very large comp. I think it was a little mixed on the way into the season. Athletic overall has been pretty good. As has active meet certainly some brands better than others. But overall, athletic and active has been good. It's been a little bit more mixed on brown shoes depending upon for woman's, ladies or kids. But we did see the run-up in flat handles, we did see block yields. We did see the sandal things take off. And we're a little bit more strategic in our transition as we're going into fall because last year we slowed foots early. And they did not perform early. And this year, we made a shift in timing. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 4% for the quarter, driven by a combination of higher traffic and basket size. Second quarter operating margin of 12.5% was up 115 basis points over 11.3% last year. Our improved profitability benefited from higher sales and lower distribution and incentive costs that were partially offset as planned by lower merchandise margins. Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 60 basis points. Distribution and buying costs delivered by 70 and 55 basis points, respectively, while domestic freight costs declined by 15 basis points. As expected, merchandise margin decreased by 80 basis points. SG&A for the period improved by 55 basis points, mainly due to higher sales and lower incentive costs. During the second quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million. As a result, we remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock for the year. Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. As Barbara noted in today's press release, our low to moderate income customers continue to face high cost on necessities, pressuring their discretionary spending. Looking ahead, our prior year sales comparisons also become more challenging during the second half of the year amidst an external environment that is highly uncertain. As a result, we continue to maintain a cautious approach in forecasting our sales. For both the third and fourth quarters, we are planning comparable sales growth of 2% to 3% on top of 5% and 7% gains, respectively, in 2023. If sales perform in line with this guidance, third quarter earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.41 versus $1.33 last year and $1.60 to $1.67 for the fourth quarter compared to $1.82 in 2023. This updated earnings guidance now reflects additional efficiencies we expect to achieve in the second half of 2024. If the second half performs in line with these projections, earnings per share for the full year are now forecast to be in the range of $6 to $6.13, up from $5.56 in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, both the 2023, fourth quarter and full year results included an approximate $0.20 per share benefit from the 53rd week. Now, let's turn to our guidance assumptions for the third quarter of 2024. Total sales are forecast to increase 3% to 5% versus the prior year. We expect to open 47 stores during the quarter, including 43 Ross and 4 dd's locations. Operating margin for the 2024 third quarter is planned to be in the 10.9% to 11.2% range, compared to 11.2% in 2023. This outlook reflects lower incentive, freight and distribution costs that are offset by lower merchandise margins as we build on our efforts to offer more sharply priced branded bargains. Net interest income is estimated to be approximately $39 million. The tax rate is projected to be 24% to 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $331 million. Now, I will turn the call over to Barbara for closing comments. And Matt, this is Adam. I know your question about the balance of the year and mark on specifically. So let me just walk you through some of the parts. So, we talked about DC cost leverage by 70 basis points in the quarter. We continue to see higher productivity in our distribution centers. We've invested in automation there. The hiring and retention environment is strong. We opened a newer DC in Houston that's providing a lift. Buying costs were also favorable, but lower incentives were the primary factor there. And then domestic freight, as we expected was a slight benefit to us and ocean freight was neutral regarding mark on specifically. So the pressure to all of that is our merchandise margin, right? We voiced about our brand strategy that continues to ramp up as we move through the year and merchandise margin dropped by 80 basis points, and we expect that pressure to step up as we move into the second half -- second half of the year. Yes, Michael, this is Adam. I'll jump in on the margin side of the question, right? We did start our efforts at the end of last year, but really the step-up was this year, right? And that's why you saw gradual pressure in Q1. We were about 15 bps worse than the prior year, but some of that, we still had some residual ocean freight benefit that was helping that number in Q1. We reported the 80 basis points in Q2. And as I mentioned, as we continue to increase that penetration of brands and going after more brands, we'll see additional pressure in the back half. And Alex, building on that a bit, we've found efficiencies in multiple parts of the P&L. I'd probably speak to domestic freight as being one primary example, where given what we're seeing from our rate structure and our contracted rates, a little bit of help from fuel costs. We thought it made sense to flow that through specifically in the back half. Lorraine, this is Adam. We're not quantifying the amount of the merchandise margin impact other than just saying it will -- we expect it to be higher than the 80 basis points that we reported in Q2. I think, offsets that we'll have in the back half, I just commented on domestic freight. That's probably the primary category. Michael touched on distribution cost and our improvement there. That would be another category. As we've experienced so far in the first half, because we're up against still a significant year from a profitability standpoint. So we expect to have -- with these projections, some good news in incentive costs as we move into the back half, I would say those are probably the biggest moving parts in terms of offsets to the merchandise margin. Adrienne, this is Adam. I'll jump in. We wouldn't speak to kind of the mix of our business, how much is branded and non-branded. But the merchandise margin pressure that I spoke to is all related to the brand strategy and that step-up in penetration. Thank you John, I'd say nothing's changed, right? We still think an additional point of comp gives us 10 to 15 basis points of margin expansion and that really hasn't changed. The long term -- where do we get to long term, we need to keep on delivering outsized comp sales gains. That's really going to be the primary driver, right? And then there's -- I guess, the other variable is, how does some of the inflationary pieces play out? What if fuel rates look like long term, et cetera, is probably the biggest moving part coupled with wages. And do they continue to stay in somewhat of a stabilized environment. So those are probably the biggest things from a long-term standpoint. And Aneesha, on the incentive piece, with the guidance that we're providing, we would still expect to see some incentive benefits. So again, it's we're going up year in 2023 where we significantly exceeded our financial plans, while we feel good about how we're tracking. We're up against a really outsized year."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Matt, I'll start with comp performance during the quarter. Cadence-wise for us, comps were strongest mid-quarter, both on a single year and a multiyear stack basis. Sure. It's Michael Hartshorn. The cadence wise, we wouldn't say any -- we wouldn't talk about inter-quarter trends going into Q3. But as I said, comps were strongest mid-quarter for us. In terms of merchandise categories, Cosmetics and Children's were the strongest areas while Home performed in line with the chain. Shoes were slightly below as it lapped tough compares from last year. And then overall, Apparel was relatively in line with the chain average. Sure. On the -- nothing has really changed on the back half of the year versus how we originally planned the year. The one thing that did change, you'll notice for the quarter, we did flow through the beat in the second quarter through the year. And then based on some of the expense initiatives and cost savings initiatives, we gave an updated view of the efficiencies across the business. We're continuously looking for ways to be more productive, but it's even more important given the planned merchandise margin pressure from our branded strategy. So what you see is, we had a projection when we started the year, we're actually a bit ahead of that, and we flowed that through the back half guidance. Sure, Paul. First, on the AUR for the quarter, the comp was driven by a combination of higher traffic and a higher basket. The average basket was slightly up as average unit retails were partially offset by fewer items per transaction. On the AUR, we're not focused on driving specific price points, but rather we're focused on offering a good, better -- good, better, best product assortment at a great value. We don't give specifics on the actual AUR or the basket. In terms of health of the consumer, I would say, based on our performance since it improved in the second quarter, what I would say, though, for us, it's obviously \u2013 we saw an improvement. But judging from industry reports, both in the first quarter and now year-to-date, the customer is clearly seeking value now, especially with, what I'd say, stubbornly persistent inflation on necessities and also an uncertain macro economy. As a result, now more than ever, we believe price value is critical for her when determining where to shop.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: And did I hear right thing that AUR was up a little bit, UPT is down?\nA \u2013 Michael Hartshorn: Yes, correct.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: But can you just maybe tie that together with the focus on value, providing the customer more value. Is there a mix impact to that AUR? Just curious what would explain it being higher as you offer more value?\nA \u2013 Michael Hartshorn: Sure, Paul. It's about \u2013 it aligns with our branded strategy. Again, we're focused on providing more brands at a great value, and that's led to the slight increase in AUR.\nQ \u2013 Paul Lejuez: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Just to start with the flow-through. The upside was obviously driven by sales. And to your point, that's about 10 to 15 basis points for every point in sale. But we also saw a better improvement on some of the expense initiatives and cost initiatives we have in the business. And so based on that, that's the upside that we forecasted in the back half of the year. Sure. Just to talk through, I guess, a couple of examples. We're certainly leveraging automation in the DCs. We continue to make improvements there, and throughout the business, including DCs and stores. Just to give you a couple of examples in the DCs. We've implemented automated vehicles to move inventory, robots to build cartons as well as automated systems to sort inventory to the stores -- at the store, which would be an SG&A and not COGS. We have a number of things to augment the work for associates. We piloted self-checkout in select locations. We have introduced new handheld devices to check inventory, to take markdowns into managed tasks and stores and are currently rolling out flexible scheduling that will help us be more productive in the stores. And Lorraine, it's at this point, too early to talk about 2025. We're just starting to go through our budget process for next year. Sure. So let me -- I'll take all of these. So shrink, let's start with shrink. It continues to be what I'd say, a very difficult retail theft environment, and we're certainly not immune to that. We have and we'll continue to invest in loss prevention initiatives to hold that shrink at bay. But frankly, we're also focused on our own execution of the measures we do have in place today. We will true-up shrink in the third quarter, and our guidance at this point assumes some deterioration from last year. On comps geographically. So for -- as we said in the commentary, geographic was fairly broad-based. For our largest market, California outperformed the chain, while Florida was in line, Texas was slightly below the chain average, and that was partially due to the impact from Hurricane Beryl that rolled through during the quarter. On wages, I would say, generally speaking, wages in our stores and DCs are relatively stable. Most of the wage increases this year have been related to statutory wage increases in certain markets and states. And so, what you see from us is most of the wage, we'll continue to take a market-by-market approach to staffing and where appropriate, we'll adjust wages if we need to. You heard Adam talked earlier about productivity in the DCs, part of that productivity improvement is due to a very stable labor market in the DC sector, which means lower turnover for us and more productivity from the more tenured associates. On the traffic patterns, we haven't seen a significant change. Certainly, the events are more important. But as far as traffic during the quarter or during the week or during the weekends or towards events. We haven't seen a significant shift. Thank you. Specifically, as it relates to border stores, I mean, California and Texas have gone back and forth as being strong, strong drivers of growth over the years. You saw in the quarter, for instance, California outperformed, Texas underperformed. It's kind of been like that over the past few years. Certainly, we do very well on the border with cross-border traffic that's some of our best and highest volume stores, but immigration specifically, I don't think we could point to across broad swaps of the regions. Good question. I wouldn't comment on the deals. But for us, we have -- we're a 2,100 stores. We think we can grow 2,900 Ross, 700 dd's, plenty of room to grow in the U.S., and our focus is on growing that store base profitably over the next number of years. So that's where we're putting our energy and our focus. I'd answer that in a couple of different ways. First, these are -- they're not -- there's a number of initiatives and they all have different timing. Some will go into next year, some will help us in the next year. Some will run out this year. But then we have the next generation of efficiencies that we'll work on for next year as well. As we said, long term, we think we can continue to gradually grow EBIT margin at a 3% to 4% comp, and that hasn't changed."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Ross Stores First Quarter 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. The call will begin with prepared comments by management, followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] \n Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations about future growth and financial results, including sales and earnings forecasts, new store openings and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and fiscal 2024 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC.  \n And now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. \nBarbara Rentler: Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2024 results, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, though we had hoped to do better, first quarter sales were still in line with our guidance despite macroeconomic headwinds that continue to pressure our customers' discretionary spending. Earnings results for the period were better than expected, primarily due to lower expenses relative to our plan. Total sales grew 8% to $4.9 billion, up from $4.5 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 3%. Earnings per share were $1.46 on net earnings of $488 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.09 on net income of $371 million for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023. \n Accessories and children's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter while California and the Pac Northwest were the top-performing regions. dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends in the first quarter were ahead of Ross as shoppers responded favorably to its improved value offering. In the newer markets, we are in the process of updating the assortments to better address the different tastes and preferences of this diverse customer base. We will continue to make ongoing adjustments over time to better position dd's for the future. \n At quarter-end, total consolidated inventories were up 10% versus last year while average store inventories were up 4% at the end of the quarter due to the 53rd week calendar shift. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventories versus 42% last year. \n Turning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 90 new stores this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. \nAdam Orvos: Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in traffic. First quarter operating margin of 12.2% was up 205 basis points from 10.1% in 2023. This improvement was due to lower distribution, incentive and freight costs that were partially offset by the planned merchandise margin decline. \n Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 140 basis points. Distribution costs levered by 75 basis points while buying improved by 50 basis points. Domestic freight improved by 30 basis points, and merchandise margin declined by 15 basis points as pressure from offering more sharply priced brands was partially offset by lower ocean freight costs. \n SG&A for the period levered by 65 basis points, mainly due to higher sales. In addition, SG&A benefited from lower incentives versus last year when we significantly outperformed our plans. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million under the new 2-year $2.1 billion authorization approved by our Board of Directors in March of this year. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock during 2024. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Ongoing uncertainty in today's macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including prolonged inflation, continue to squeeze our low to moderate income customers' purchasing power. As a result, we will remain especially focused on delivering a wide assortment of branded values throughout our stores. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2024, comparable sales are forecast to be up 2% to 3%. Second quarter 2024 earnings per share are projected to be $1.43 to $1.49 versus $1.32 for the 13 weeks ended July 23, 2023.  \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2024 include the following. Total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 24 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 3 dd's locations. If same-store sales perform in line with our forecast, operating margin for the second quarter is projected to be in the 11.5% to 11.8% range compared to 11.3% in 2023. Higher sales and lower incentive and distribution costs are expected to be partially offset by a decline in merchandise margin as we build on our efforts to offer more sharply priced brands. We expect net interest income to be approximately $37 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 332 million. \n Now turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and forward guidance, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, remain unchanged at up 2% to 3%. We now project earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, to be in the range of $5.79 to $5.98 compared to $5.56 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share favorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the first quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.20 from the 53rd week. \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you, Adam. While overall sales were respectable in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in the external environment, including prolonged inflation, that continue to pressure discretionary spending from our low to moderate income customers. As a result, it's more important than ever that we remain focused on delivering the best branded values that we can possibly offer. In addition, we'll continue to manage inventory expenses tightly in order to maximize sales and earnings growth over the balance of the year. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. \nLorraine Maikis: Barbara, I wanted to follow up on the efforts to offer more sharply priced products to your customers. Were you pleased with the initial results in the first quarter? Do you think it led to market share gain? And what's the margin implication of your plans to build on this initiative? \nBarbara Rentler: So let me start with, just on the whole, our progress. We feel like in the first quarter, we made progress on our initiatives. And so we're still at the early stages of it, but we feel like it's a good place to be. \n In terms of do we think we gained market share from that, at this point, I don't really think we could determine whether we think that's the case. \n And in terms of the sharply priced initiatives, we feel like -- well, Lorraine, just say that piece again so I make sure I answer that piece of that sharply priced correctly. \nLorraine Maikis: I just wanted to hear about the go-forward margin implication of your plans to build on the initiative. \nAdam Orvos: Yes. Lorraine, this is Adam. I'll jump in on that. So higher-quality branded merchandise will typically carry lower margins relative to lower quality, less recognizable brands. So as we move through the year, this will be pressured throughout the year, but will be even more so in the back half of fiscal 2024 as we continue to make further progress on this, as Barbara talked about. We really feel like long term, this is the right thing for us to do to position us to capture market share going forward. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI. \nMichael Binetti: Congrats on a great quarter. And I don't know if Michael is in the room, but Michael or Adam jump ball. Is 3% same-store sales growth, 200 basis points of EBIT margin the new normal algorithm? And if not, can you walk us through -- you mentioned lower expenses relative to plan. Can you just help us think about the puts and takes on gross margin and SG&A for the rest of the year? I'm assuming you'll -- I'm assuming we're not levering 200 basis points on 3% going forward. So maybe just help us understand within the context of the 2% to 3% guidance, what base that was so helpful in the quarter and what rolls off a little bit.  \n And then maybe -- it seems like dd's improved a lot more than you thought if it was above Ross, just 90 days after you telling us you had to make some adjustments to the assortment there and some of the stores performing below what you thought. Maybe just some thoughts on dd's and what's going on with the lower-income consumer. \nAdam Orvos: I'll take the first part, Mike. I appreciate the spirit of your question, but you're right. So domestic -- so let me just kind of walk through all the parts, right? So the EPS beat and operating margin benefit, lower distribution costs. \n So we had higher productivity in our distribution centers. We opened a new facility in Houston a couple of years ago. So that's getting fully ramped up. So that's providing productivity benefits. I would say on the DC cost front, the hiring environment and the retention environment is favorable. And we've also made investments in productivity in the distribution centers. And then lastly on that front, I'd say that the $0.02 of benefit that we talked about in timing is largely packaway benefit that kind of impacts the DC cost. \n We had better -- as expected, we had better domestic freight costs in the quarter. I would expect that to continue through the balance of the year at somewhat -- it'll be a little bit choppy, but at somewhat similar levels. We went through a bidding process, felt good about those results. As we sit here today, fuel slightly helping us versus last year. \n And then as we've talked about for some time, incentives. Some good news in Q1, that'll be winded our back through the balance of the year. So even though we had strong profitability into Q1, we're still up against 2023 where we significantly outperformed our plans. \nMichael Hartshorn: Michael, there's one other nuance in the first quarter. The -- because your sales are based on a fiscal basis, your comps are on a restated. There's an outsized impact between your total sales and your comp sales because of that disconnect that corrects itself through the year. So we actually get higher leverage in the first quarter. Longer term, though, we would still expect the leverage at 3% to 4%. \n On dd's, as we said in the commentary, sales trends were ahead of Ross. That's due, in part, to the easier prior year comparisons, but also shoppers responded favorably to our improved value offerings. I would say we're just at the beginning stages of making merchandise adjustments there to improve the value offerings. And while we're encouraged by the initial customer response, it's still very, very early. \nMichael Binetti: One point of clarification. Is that -- did the efficiencies from the DC costs ramping, does that continue with us after first quarter through the year? \nAdam Orvos: Likely stays with us through the balance of the year. But not -- just clarifying, not at the level we saw in Q1, right? So the Q1 number that we reported is -- it has the benefit of the packaway timing right? So that's -- step back that in a tangible way. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. \nMatthew Boss: Congrats on another nice quarter. So Barbara, could you speak to current health of your core consumer today? Or any changes in your view relative to 3 months ago? \n And then just on cadence, could you speak to traffic versus basket trends as the quarter progressed? And just your confidence in similar performance in the second quarter and the back half of the year. \nMichael Hartshorn: Matthew, that's a lot to take in, but I'll start with the health of the consumer. I would say it's hard to say on the health of the consumer. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty in the macro economy. The silver lining for our business is the customer is seeking value more than ever, and we're in a position to deliver that. \n In terms of cadence, as you know, we typically do not get into what the monthly cadence is. I would say that the performance during the quarter was choppy throughout the quarter with weather, the Easter calendar shift and tax refund timing. For us, even though weather was choppy during the quarter, it was relatively neutral for the entire quarter. \nAdam Orvos: And on the comp components, average basket was up slightly. So we had higher AUR driven by a higher mix of brands and is partially offset by lower units per transaction. \nBarbara Rentler: And on the health of the consumer go forward, look, our low to moderate income consumer is still being squeezed, I mean, prolonged deflation, macroeconomic environment. I think our job to drive sales is for us to continue to offer really the best possible branded bargains that we can. The value that she really wants because she really does want to buy a brand, better quality, better product, but she needs to have it at a price that she really can afford. \n And I think if we continue to deliver on that as our strategy progresses, as we go throughout the year, I think we'll probably define. I think that's an important component for her because she does want to continue to shop and do things, but she's got to find a place where she can get -- really get what she needs because I don't foresee anyone thinking that the pressure on that customer is going to be any different. \n So it's really the pressure is more on us to execute at a higher level. And I -- so far, we're, I would say, happy with the progress that we've made on the brand offerings, but we still have a long way to go. So if we continue to execute at a high level, again, I think the health of the customer, which will be challenging, I think we'll still be able to service her. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird. \nMark Altschwager: Maybe following up on that last comment. You delivered at the high end of your guidance, but you did comment that you hoped to do better. Have you identified any low-hanging fruit from an execution standpoint in the quarter? Or is the delta versus what you may have hoped for more a function of the external environment being kind of less accommodating for you? \n And then separately, I was hoping you could speak to the current buying environment, generally, availability across the good, better, best. And as you continue to lean into this value strategy, are the merchants finding any greater ability to offset the margin pressure than maybe you initially thought a few months ago? \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. In terms of the sales, our apparel business in Q1 did not perform below the chain. So as we go forward, if we continue to execute at a higher level and continue with our brand strategy, our apparel business, as we go forward, should improve as it historically improves as you get to quarters 2, 3 and 4. So that's the one piece of our business that, in Q1, we were not as happy with and recognize that we have more progress to make, more things to accomplish, and that's a focus for us. \n So in terms of everything working perfect, I don't believe there's, I would call, low-hanging fruit. I think the whole thing with sales is really going to be about how we execute and how we make the strategic moves we want to make, because the strategies by business of where we are on the brand increases and the penetration is not the same within the company. So some areas have more opportunity as we increase our brands, and some areas, much further along in that strategy because some of those strategies really started at the back end of '23, which is what drove a lot of our '23 business and gave us the courage to go forward and to expand on the strategy. So as we go again, as we go along, we would think that, that would help to improve our sales. \n In terms of the buying environment, there's absolutely this merchandise availability, as it usually is, and it's pretty broad-based. As usual, there are some businesses that have more availability than others. That's just the natural kind of ebb and flow of the entire scenario. \n And then just repeat the part about the value. What's the part about value part of your question? \nMark Altschwager: Yes. Are you finding any -- are the merchants finding any greater opportunity to kind of offset the margin pressure than maybe you thought a few months ago? \nBarbara Rentler: Well -- look, if the merchants are getting better deals, we're passing it along to the customer because we really believe that offering her good quality, branded products at sharp prices is very important for us to be able to really satisfy the customer when she's really under -- she's under pressure. So we would pass that along to the consumer. So that's really what -- that's really how we're thinking about it at this point. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. \nCharles Grom: Curious what you'd attribute to the dd's outperformance to, clearly, a nice surprise today. And then just as a quick follow-up, any thoughts on the home category performance? \nMichael Hartshorn: Chuck, on the -- on dd's, as I said, part of the performance was against easier prior year comparisons than Ross. But we do believe that we've started making adjustments, and the customer is responding. And I'll just repeat, we think we're at the very early stages of making the merchandise adjustments we need to make. So we'll see how it progresses through the year. \nBarbara Rentler: At a high level, the merchants improved the value offerings that they had, whether it's different assortments, broader assortments, better quality, better products. So I think we've taken our first step forward there. And to Michael's point, we feel like there's room for us to improve. And if we continue to improve, even this low-income customer, if we can satisfy her, we should define.\n And in terms of the home category, home outperformed the company. So there are puts and takes in the home business right now with some businesses that are stronger than others. And -- but overall, it outperformed, and we still see a lot of opportunity in our home business based on the size of it and the categories that we're in. But overall, there are some businesses that are softer than others. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Alex Straton with Morgan Stanley. \nAlexandra Straton: Great. Maybe for Barbara, what KPIs are you focused on as you're assessing if some of these value initiatives are working or if they're worth rolling out more across the chain? \nBarbara Rentler: The way we're thinking about this is we are actually building the margins the way we see them. We have a merchandise strategy. We've developed a value strategy by type of product, and we then went in and figured out what the margins would be. So at this stage of the game, as you know, we've lowered our margins to be able to get those values on the floor to satisfy the customer and to gain market share. This whole thing is about us gaining market share. So at this point in time, where our strategy is to pass along the values as we get them. And so I wouldn't say it's quite as rigid as, last year, my margin was X and I've got to plan to Y. It's not. It's a strategy we want to execute. \n And so we've put together, again, all the metrics based off of what we want, the products we want on the floor, the values we want on the floor, and so that we're satisfying the customer because that is the gains to market share. So right now, it's built up bottom up. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. \nTracy Kogan: It's Tracy Kogan filling in for Paul. I just wanted to clarify if -- was anything within cost of good meaningfully favorable to your plan? Or was it primarily an SG&A beat?\n And then I know you mentioned you expect lower margins on these more recognizable brands. But I'm wondering if you build in any benefit from having faster inventory turns or lower markdowns because the customers -- these are brands that customers want? \nMichael Hartshorn: Within the cost of goods sold, Tracy, freight is included in our cost of goods sold, and we did see favorability. \nAdam Orvos: Yes, and the DC cost. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of what we've built in because they're recognizable brands, they turn quickly. But quite frankly, we turn everything quickly. So in terms of a benefit just purely out of turn, I don't see that as one of our levers in terms of markdowns. I think the markdowns will be reasonable based on the brands that they are, the value they are, the retailers they are. And so again, we have gone in and we built that bottom up. \n So we didn't go in and say that we have any expectations that certain things are going to turn a certain weeks of supply because, remember, we're in a process here. So we're learning, right? So we're -- as we're going, it's evolving, and we're fine-tuning what we're doing. Our expectation would be, yes, that our turns will continue to improve. But with that, we didn't build with a specific turn expectation. And again, the company turns everything very quickly. So our expectations on this would be level set based off of what we think the customer will accept. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Barclays. \nAdrienne Yih-Tennant: Great, and nice quarter. Barbara, my question is on the packaway. The 41%, I believe, was this quarter. Typically, if I'm correct, that's typically short stay, I think. Can you comment on if you were being impacted by weather events as with TJX than most frontline retailers also would be? Are you seeing that short stay opportunity? And have you taken advantage of it to deploy in the second quarter, perhaps? \nMichael Hartshorn: Adrienne, just on -- before the packaway, packaway usually stays in about -- the average is about 4 months. That said, you could obviously use it for short stay if you needed to. \nBarbara Rentler: So in terms of you're asking are there closeout opportunities out there based off of tough weather across the country and as vendors move goods. I think some vendors are starting to move goods, and some vendors, depending upon what your cash flows look like, are still holding on to those goods because of everything that you're saying. The weather was a little bit tougher across the country, and they don't really need to move those goods today. If we were at June 15th, I might tell you something different. So I really think that goes back to who the vendor is, what their needs are, what their cash flow is, if they're a public -- it is a variety of things. \n But at this point in time, have there been some closeouts? Yes, there's been some closeouts. But what you're saying, were there a big [ jugs ] of goods that we would short stay but was a great deal, absolutely, we would do that. But at this moment in time, we're a little early in the game. I don't think vendors are feeling that anxious about those products yet. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim. \nRobert Drbul: Great quarter. I was just wondering if you could talk more on the geographic differences and -- within both Ross and dd's, if there was a big variation within your store base in terms of [indiscernible]. \nMichael Hartshorn: Sure, Bob. I would only talk on a consolidated basis. But as we said in the commentary, the geographic performance was strongest in California and the Pacific Northwest. Both of those are areas that were impacted by poor weather last year, so easier compare perhaps. For our other largest markets, Texas was above the chain while Florida was just slightly below. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. \nSimeon Siegel: Just so recognizing the goal for the sharper prices, what is the implied AUR embedded within the comp guides that you've given? \n And then just higher level, as you think about the challenges of the environment, but also perhaps the potential trade down into your business as you think about the market share, I guess how do you assess prioritizing the assortment of sharply priced brands versus maybe some better brands that are a little bit higher priced but still great value to bring people in? \nMichael Hartshorn: On AUR, I'd say we don't plan or focus on driving a specific price point. While it was up in the first quarter, our focus is on delivering the most compelling value as possible, which, as we said, we believe will drive sales and market share gains. \nBarbara Rentler: And in terms of the sharper prices, I just want to be clear, the sharper prices are necessarily just in a goods -- in the goods. Sharper prices, I really should probably used word stronger values on the floor. So that's tiered up in all different -- each one of those tiers. It's not just we're looking for an opening. It's not an opening price point strategy. It's a value strategy, but the values, let's say, we offer perhaps 4, a type of product or 1 of those 3 buckets, we may have sharpened so that the customer is getting an even better deal, an even better value. So that's really how we're thinking about the strategy. I probably shouldn't be using the word price because I think everyone is finding that a little bit confusing. But is that the answer to your question? \nSimeon Siegel: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. Good clarification. So is that -- do you see that as an opportunity for a trade down for customers that were -- that you didn't otherwise have, not in your core, but in those that'll come lower, that'll trade down into you? \nBarbara Rentler: I mean, I think that's hard for us to measure. But I think the more brand that we get and the broader assortments we can offer, the more customers we'll get. We gain the -- our purpose here is to gain market share, right? And so gaining market share, you like to gain different customers. And so if we get more branded, have unbelievable values and get broader in assortments, that I would imagine would be the combination we need to gain more market share. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. \nUnknown Analyst: This is [ Julianna ] on for Ike. On dd's specifically, given some improvements seen there, if perhaps that continues throughout the rest of the year, are there any thoughts on revising the real estate opportunity there, whether that's closures and more opening? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's a good question. I think right now, as you know, we slowed down growth specifically in the new markets. I think we'll have to see sustained trends before we reaccelerate growth in those newer markets. But if we see it, then we would do so. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Brooke Roach with Goldman Sachs. \nBrooke Roach: Barbara, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the opportunity that you see to improve the execution of apparel. Do you believe that the performance of the category is a function of weather or fashion execution? Or is this simply a function of being in the earlier stages of your sharper value-price strategy versus other categories? Just curious how you're thinking about implementing that, especially given some other companies that have invested more heavily in price in the full-price sector. \nBarbara Rentler: Sure. Look, weather, we didn't think of weather as a major component. It's always part of the component. And in Q1, our business in apparel, historically, has been very challenging. So we go into the quarter with a conservative plan, seeing how it works and then chase. That's what we've done for years. The early sharpened prices and in the assortment, our new strategy, I think we're at the beginning apparel, particularly in the ladies apparel, we're at the very early stages of that. \n So I think in terms of an opportunity to improve, I think it's there because I think we -- the customer wants -- our apparel business has been challenging over the last few quarters, and the customer wants something different. And this is what she's voting on, and we can see -- although particularly in ladies at the beginning of the journey, we can see what she's voting on and what we need to build on. So I think there are opportunities to improve. I think there are some things that are tangible. I don't think it will be an overnight thing in ladies. As we know, ladies is naturally a challenging business, but I feel like there's things that we can build on at this point. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with the Telsey Advisory Group. \nDana Telsey: As you think about the offering of value in both concepts, Ross and dd's, is the magnitude of what you're working to do, does it differ by category in terms of the more intensified value, whether home or apparel? And does it differ at all by concept in terms of what you expect to change? \nBarbara Rentler: Okay. Let's start with -- so with Ross, the magnitude is different by category. Some businesses, by the nature of what they are, are more branded. Like shoes, for example, that's a highly branded business. Handbags is a highly branded business. Naturally, it's the highly branded business. And then I think as we go into different categories, we've set different targets of what that looks like based off of what's in the outside world, the brand -- just the brand strategies of everyone else and what that looks like and what we think that percent should be for us. So that is built with a strategy of what we believe it should be.\n Now I will tell you, as we're going through this, as you would expect and imagine, it evolves, right? So we learn and the customer is telling us, and we're going to keep learning and keep evolving. And so some of these businesses will take longer to go on. But some of the business naturally are different. If we move over to the home bucket, as you know, there are certain parts of the home that can be branded and then certain parts of homes that are not branded. So housewares is a very branded business. Bed and bath can be very branded. If you go into room decor and furniture and things like that, they're not necessarily branded. \n So again, we built the entire company strategies by business, by -- in a good, better, best, what do we think it should look like? Where are we today? And where do we think we want to get to in our first path until the customer votes and really tells us? In which case, I'm sure that some things will accelerate more than what we originally expected, and maybe some things will be a little bit less than we originally expected. So that's kind of where we are on the Ross side. \n On the dd's side, the dd's customer, that assortment isn't quite -- is not as -- it's not as branded as the Ross customer. But even in that assortment, you want to make sure that you're offering the customer different tiers. Their version of what might be best is a different tier than what the best at Ross. But what is stretched for that customer? And again, we want to make sure that the quality is good. The fashion's right, and the prices are sharp. So it's different -- the thought process is similar, but it's not the same in terms of execution because the models are not the same. The brands are not the same. Customer is not exactly the same. But thinking through it, as you would think that the value is the best bucket at dd's would not be as big as the best bucket at Ross could be. \n But again, dd's, we're at the very beginning of where we're going with that. The performance, with improved value offerings this quarter, shows we're getting ourselves kind of back on track. We're up against easier compare. I understand that. But the merchants are now moving in a direction, and that, too, will have to seek its own level. \n But the Ross side of the strategy is much more structured than on the dd's side since we also have other work, consumer work, that's going on about other things we need to do in that assortment, more broader in terms of satisfying some of her needs more necessarily than on the tiering of good, better, best. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. \nAneesha Sherman: So your comp guidance of 2% to 3% through the year is an acceleration versus this quarter and whether you look at it on a 1-year basis or a 2-year stack or even versus 2019. Can you talk about what drives your confidence in that acceleration? Is it about these changes you're making to assortment in pricing? Or is it around macro or something else? \n And then a quick follow-up for Adam. You didn't mention wages as a headwind. Are you happy with where you are on wages at stores and DCs? And do you see that being a continued area of investment? Or are you good where you are now? \nMichael Hartshorn: Aneesha, on the guidance, I mean I would say it's our best assessment of where the business is and the merchandising plans we have to further increase the branded bargains we offer as we progress through the year. As you know and as you look at the stack comps, we have, for many years now, had stronger comps beyond the first quarter. So we believe we plan the business appropriately based on what we know. \n On wages, I would say, generally speaking, wages on our stores and DCs are relatively stable. In fact, part of the productivity improvements in the DCs in the first quarter is lower turnover, which mean we had more tenured associates and they were more productive. So I think we feel good about the -- where we are with wages. And like we always have, we'll take a market-by-market approach. And where we need to raise wages, we will. \nAdam Orvos: But the pressure is still there from where we have to take statutory increases, right? And that's where we're -- as Michael said and as I said earlier, that's where we're working hard, to try to find offsets to them. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Laura Champine with Loop Capital Markets. \nLaura Champine: I wanted to check in on inventory as it grew faster than sales despite packaway actually being a little bit lower as a percentage of the mix. Is there some spring product in areas that had negative weather trends that maybe you're looking to sell through? Or if you could give us some thoughts there. \nMichael Hartshorn: In terms of inventory, part of the increase, Laura, was that with the fiscal calendar, restated calendar at fiscal year-end, we were 1 month closer to Mother's Day where we tend to drive receipts. So that's why you see in-store inventory position up 4%. I'd say the other factor is we do have more goods in transit. Part of that is due to the Suez Canal, and we're going around the Horn of Africa. So that creates a little bit more of in-transit inventory coming into the country. \nLaura Champine: Is that like -- sorry. Sorry, Barbara. \nBarbara Rentler: Go ahead. No, go ahead, Laura. \nLaura Champine: I don't want to cut you off on that one. \nBarbara Rentler: No, no, no. I was going to -- I was going to pivot, so go back -- go back to Michael. \nLaura Champine: Okay. The Suez Canal issue, does that create a reversal in your positive freight costs as we move through the year? Or do you think that is going to be a benefit all year long? \nMichael Hartshorn: It's actually relatively flat for the rest of the year in terms of ocean freight, and we do have the -- we do have our contracts locked in at this point, including the Suez Canal shipments. \nAdam Orvos: We think ocean freight will be neutral the balance of the year and it's more of a transit time issue than a cost. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. \nMarni Shapiro: Nice quarter with traffic up again. And I'm curious if there's anything you could point to that's driving the increases in traffic. And also, I've noticed you guys -- that Ross stores, in general, has been a little bit more active on social media. You are showing -- or maybe you're just showing up in all my feeds. You're showing up on my For You page in TikTok actually. So I was curious if -- are the 2 things related potentially? Are you getting a younger shopper coming in? If you could just talk a little bit about that. \nMichael Hartshorn: Marni, we're just showing up in your feeds. No, our marketing strategy has stayed fairly consistent. We have -- like everybody else over the years, have shifted more of our media to digital from broadcast, and maybe that's what you're seeing because we have more of our marketing in digital channels. \nMarni Shapiro: Maybe. And the fact that I'm talking about you, my phone is listening to me. But are you getting -- are you seeing younger shoppers coming into the store? And are you getting new shoppers into the stores? \nMichael Hartshorn: I would say it's -- we've always done well with the younger customer, and we continue to do well with the younger customer. When we look at the performance, say, Q4 and Q1, it's been fairly broad-based across trade area demographics, and that includes income. So from an income standpoint, it's hard to pinpoint whether there's increasingly a trade-down customer. But what it does say is we're attracting a very broad customer base, which is good for us. \nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of John Kernan from TD Cowen. \nAlexander Douglas: This is Alex on for John. So I had one on gross margin. So how should we think about the quarterly sequencing of gross margin through fiscal '24 and any puts and takes there? \n And then also related to that, it looks like you guys are still running a little below your pre-COVID gross margin run rate of 28%, 29%. Is that just due to the focus on sharper values? Or is there anything else that we should be thinking about there? \nAdam Orvos: Alex, so domestic freight, it was favorable in Q1; expected to be favorable, the balance of the year, assuming fuel stays where it is. We talked about distribution cost. Feel good about productivity levels, the hiring environment, we'd expect that to continue the balance of the year. Merchandise margin is probably the big call-out, that we were below last year in Q1 and expect that to get -- to be further below last year as we move through the quarter, as we get further into the branded strategy that Barbara spoke of. \n I think back to the -- I guess, your pre-COVID question, still bullish on our ability to drive leverage, so again, anywhere between a 3% and a 4% comp. We believe we'll have operating margin leverage. It'll take -- to get back to pre-COVID levels, it'll take outsized comp sales growth. That's the most important variable. And I think the kind of the biggest variables are where fuel prices over time and assuming that wages continue to stabilize. \nMichael Hartshorn: The biggest difference is, though, in gross margin between pre-COVID levels are freight costs that spiked during COVID. They're still pretty sticky with driver wages, but we made progress last year. We're going to make progress again. And then the other big factor is in our distribution center with wages, and you see that at least in the first quarter, we had good productivity gains. So both of those, we believe, we can track back over time, again, depending on the macro economy when it comes to fuel prices on freight. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Barbara Rentler for any closing comments. \nBarbara Rentler: Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. \nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Barbara Rentler",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Hartshorn, Group President, Chief Operating Officer; Adam Orvos, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Group Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter 2024 results, followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. \n As noted in today's press release, though we had hoped to do better, first quarter sales were still in line with our guidance despite macroeconomic headwinds that continue to pressure our customers' discretionary spending. Earnings results for the period were better than expected, primarily due to lower expenses relative to our plan. Total sales grew 8% to $4.9 billion, up from $4.5 billion last year, while comparable store sales rose 3%. Earnings per share were $1.46 on net earnings of $488 million for the 13 weeks ended May 4, 2024. These results compare to earnings per share of $1.09 on net income of $371 million for the 13 weeks ended April 29, 2023. \n Accessories and children's were the strongest merchandise areas during the quarter while California and the Pac Northwest were the top-performing regions. dd's DISCOUNTS sales trends in the first quarter were ahead of Ross as shoppers responded favorably to its improved value offering. In the newer markets, we are in the process of updating the assortments to better address the different tastes and preferences of this diverse customer base. We will continue to make ongoing adjustments over time to better position dd's for the future. \n At quarter-end, total consolidated inventories were up 10% versus last year while average store inventories were up 4% at the end of the quarter due to the 53rd week calendar shift. Packaway merchandise represented 41% of total inventories versus 42% last year. \n Turning to store growth. We opened 11 new Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations in the first quarter. We continue to plan for approximately 90 new stores this year, comprised of about 75 Ross and 15 dd's. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate about 10 to 15 older stores. \n Now Adam will provide further details on our first quarter results and additional color on our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Thank you, Adam. While overall sales were respectable in the first quarter, there remains uncertainty in the external environment, including prolonged inflation, that continue to pressure discretionary spending from our low to moderate income customers. As a result, it's more important than ever that we remain focused on delivering the best branded values that we can possibly offer. In addition, we'll continue to manage inventory expenses tightly in order to maximize sales and earnings growth over the balance of the year. \n At this point, we'd like to open up the call and respond to any questions you may have. So let me start with, just on the whole, our progress. We feel like in the first quarter, we made progress on our initiatives. And so we're still at the early stages of it, but we feel like it's a good place to be. \n In terms of do we think we gained market share from that, at this point, I don't really think we could determine whether we think that's the case. \n And in terms of the sharply priced initiatives, we feel like -- well, Lorraine, just say that piece again so I make sure I answer that piece of that sharply priced correctly. And on the health of the consumer go forward, look, our low to moderate income consumer is still being squeezed, I mean, prolonged deflation, macroeconomic environment. I think our job to drive sales is for us to continue to offer really the best possible branded bargains that we can. The value that she really wants because she really does want to buy a brand, better quality, better product, but she needs to have it at a price that she really can afford. \n And I think if we continue to deliver on that as our strategy progresses, as we go throughout the year, I think we'll probably define. I think that's an important component for her because she does want to continue to shop and do things, but she's got to find a place where she can get -- really get what she needs because I don't foresee anyone thinking that the pressure on that customer is going to be any different. \n So it's really the pressure is more on us to execute at a higher level. And I -- so far, we're, I would say, happy with the progress that we've made on the brand offerings, but we still have a long way to go. So if we continue to execute at a high level, again, I think the health of the customer, which will be challenging, I think we'll still be able to service her. Sure. In terms of the sales, our apparel business in Q1 did not perform below the chain. So as we go forward, if we continue to execute at a higher level and continue with our brand strategy, our apparel business, as we go forward, should improve as it historically improves as you get to quarters 2, 3 and 4. So that's the one piece of our business that, in Q1, we were not as happy with and recognize that we have more progress to make, more things to accomplish, and that's a focus for us. \n So in terms of everything working perfect, I don't believe there's, I would call, low-hanging fruit. I think the whole thing with sales is really going to be about how we execute and how we make the strategic moves we want to make, because the strategies by business of where we are on the brand increases and the penetration is not the same within the company. So some areas have more opportunity as we increase our brands, and some areas, much further along in that strategy because some of those strategies really started at the back end of '23, which is what drove a lot of our '23 business and gave us the courage to go forward and to expand on the strategy. So as we go again, as we go along, we would think that, that would help to improve our sales. \n In terms of the buying environment, there's absolutely this merchandise availability, as it usually is, and it's pretty broad-based. As usual, there are some businesses that have more availability than others. That's just the natural kind of ebb and flow of the entire scenario. \n And then just repeat the part about the value. What's the part about value part of your question? Well -- look, if the merchants are getting better deals, we're passing it along to the customer because we really believe that offering her good quality, branded products at sharp prices is very important for us to be able to really satisfy the customer when she's really under -- she's under pressure. So we would pass that along to the consumer. So that's really what -- that's really how we're thinking about it at this point. At a high level, the merchants improved the value offerings that they had, whether it's different assortments, broader assortments, better quality, better products. So I think we've taken our first step forward there. And to Michael's point, we feel like there's room for us to improve. And if we continue to improve, even this low-income customer, if we can satisfy her, we should define.\n And in terms of the home category, home outperformed the company. So there are puts and takes in the home business right now with some businesses that are stronger than others. And -- but overall, it outperformed, and we still see a lot of opportunity in our home business based on the size of it and the categories that we're in. But overall, there are some businesses that are softer than others. The way we're thinking about this is we are actually building the margins the way we see them. We have a merchandise strategy. We've developed a value strategy by type of product, and we then went in and figured out what the margins would be. So at this stage of the game, as you know, we've lowered our margins to be able to get those values on the floor to satisfy the customer and to gain market share. This whole thing is about us gaining market share. So at this point in time, where our strategy is to pass along the values as we get them. And so I wouldn't say it's quite as rigid as, last year, my margin was X and I've got to plan to Y. It's not. It's a strategy we want to execute. \n And so we've put together, again, all the metrics based off of what we want, the products we want on the floor, the values we want on the floor, and so that we're satisfying the customer because that is the gains to market share. So right now, it's built up bottom up. And in terms of what we've built in because they're recognizable brands, they turn quickly. But quite frankly, we turn everything quickly. So in terms of a benefit just purely out of turn, I don't see that as one of our levers in terms of markdowns. I think the markdowns will be reasonable based on the brands that they are, the value they are, the retailers they are. And so again, we have gone in and we built that bottom up. \n So we didn't go in and say that we have any expectations that certain things are going to turn a certain weeks of supply because, remember, we're in a process here. So we're learning, right? So we're -- as we're going, it's evolving, and we're fine-tuning what we're doing. Our expectation would be, yes, that our turns will continue to improve. But with that, we didn't build with a specific turn expectation. And again, the company turns everything very quickly. So our expectations on this would be level set based off of what we think the customer will accept. So in terms of you're asking are there closeout opportunities out there based off of tough weather across the country and as vendors move goods. I think some vendors are starting to move goods, and some vendors, depending upon what your cash flows look like, are still holding on to those goods because of everything that you're saying. The weather was a little bit tougher across the country, and they don't really need to move those goods today. If we were at June 15th, I might tell you something different. So I really think that goes back to who the vendor is, what their needs are, what their cash flow is, if they're a public -- it is a variety of things. \n But at this point in time, have there been some closeouts? Yes, there's been some closeouts. But what you're saying, were there a big [ jugs ] of goods that we would short stay but was a great deal, absolutely, we would do that. But at this moment in time, we're a little early in the game. I don't think vendors are feeling that anxious about those products yet. And in terms of the sharper prices, I just want to be clear, the sharper prices are necessarily just in a goods -- in the goods. Sharper prices, I really should probably used word stronger values on the floor. So that's tiered up in all different -- each one of those tiers. It's not just we're looking for an opening. It's not an opening price point strategy. It's a value strategy, but the values, let's say, we offer perhaps 4, a type of product or 1 of those 3 buckets, we may have sharpened so that the customer is getting an even better deal, an even better value. So that's really how we're thinking about the strategy. I probably shouldn't be using the word price because I think everyone is finding that a little bit confusing. But is that the answer to your question? I mean, I think that's hard for us to measure. But I think the more brand that we get and the broader assortments we can offer, the more customers we'll get. We gain the -- our purpose here is to gain market share, right? And so gaining market share, you like to gain different customers. And so if we get more branded, have unbelievable values and get broader in assortments, that I would imagine would be the combination we need to gain more market share. Sure. Look, weather, we didn't think of weather as a major component. It's always part of the component. And in Q1, our business in apparel, historically, has been very challenging. So we go into the quarter with a conservative plan, seeing how it works and then chase. That's what we've done for years. The early sharpened prices and in the assortment, our new strategy, I think we're at the beginning apparel, particularly in the ladies apparel, we're at the very early stages of that. \n So I think in terms of an opportunity to improve, I think it's there because I think we -- the customer wants -- our apparel business has been challenging over the last few quarters, and the customer wants something different. And this is what she's voting on, and we can see -- although particularly in ladies at the beginning of the journey, we can see what she's voting on and what we need to build on. So I think there are opportunities to improve. I think there are some things that are tangible. I don't think it will be an overnight thing in ladies. As we know, ladies is naturally a challenging business, but I feel like there's things that we can build on at this point. Okay. Let's start with -- so with Ross, the magnitude is different by category. Some businesses, by the nature of what they are, are more branded. Like shoes, for example, that's a highly branded business. Handbags is a highly branded business. Naturally, it's the highly branded business. And then I think as we go into different categories, we've set different targets of what that looks like based off of what's in the outside world, the brand -- just the brand strategies of everyone else and what that looks like and what we think that percent should be for us. So that is built with a strategy of what we believe it should be.\n Now I will tell you, as we're going through this, as you would expect and imagine, it evolves, right? So we learn and the customer is telling us, and we're going to keep learning and keep evolving. And so some of these businesses will take longer to go on. But some of the business naturally are different. If we move over to the home bucket, as you know, there are certain parts of the home that can be branded and then certain parts of homes that are not branded. So housewares is a very branded business. Bed and bath can be very branded. If you go into room decor and furniture and things like that, they're not necessarily branded. \n So again, we built the entire company strategies by business, by -- in a good, better, best, what do we think it should look like? Where are we today? And where do we think we want to get to in our first path until the customer votes and really tells us? In which case, I'm sure that some things will accelerate more than what we originally expected, and maybe some things will be a little bit less than we originally expected. So that's kind of where we are on the Ross side. \n On the dd's side, the dd's customer, that assortment isn't quite -- is not as -- it's not as branded as the Ross customer. But even in that assortment, you want to make sure that you're offering the customer different tiers. Their version of what might be best is a different tier than what the best at Ross. But what is stretched for that customer? And again, we want to make sure that the quality is good. The fashion's right, and the prices are sharp. So it's different -- the thought process is similar, but it's not the same in terms of execution because the models are not the same. The brands are not the same. Customer is not exactly the same. But thinking through it, as you would think that the value is the best bucket at dd's would not be as big as the best bucket at Ross could be. \n But again, dd's, we're at the very beginning of where we're going with that. The performance, with improved value offerings this quarter, shows we're getting ourselves kind of back on track. We're up against easier compare. I understand that. But the merchants are now moving in a direction, and that, too, will have to seek its own level. \n But the Ross side of the strategy is much more structured than on the dd's side since we also have other work, consumer work, that's going on about other things we need to do in that assortment, more broader in terms of satisfying some of her needs more necessarily than on the tiering of good, better, best. Go ahead. No, go ahead, Laura. No, no, no. I was going to -- I was going to pivot, so go back -- go back to Michael. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores."

            "content": "Thank you, Barbara. As previously mentioned, our comparable store sales were up 3% for the quarter, primarily driven by an increase in traffic. First quarter operating margin of 12.2% was up 205 basis points from 10.1% in 2023. This improvement was due to lower distribution, incentive and freight costs that were partially offset by the planned merchandise margin decline. \n Cost of goods sold during the period improved by 140 basis points. Distribution costs levered by 75 basis points while buying improved by 50 basis points. Domestic freight improved by 30 basis points, and merchandise margin declined by 15 basis points as pressure from offering more sharply priced brands was partially offset by lower ocean freight costs. \n SG&A for the period levered by 65 basis points, mainly due to higher sales. In addition, SG&A benefited from lower incentives versus last year when we significantly outperformed our plans. During the first quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for an aggregate cost of $262 million under the new 2-year $2.1 billion authorization approved by our Board of Directors in March of this year. We remain on track to buy back a total of $1.05 billion in stock during 2024. \n Now let's discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2024. Ongoing uncertainty in today's macroeconomic and geopolitical environments, including prolonged inflation, continue to squeeze our low to moderate income customers' purchasing power. As a result, we will remain especially focused on delivering a wide assortment of branded values throughout our stores. For the 13 weeks ending August 3, 2024, comparable sales are forecast to be up 2% to 3%. Second quarter 2024 earnings per share are projected to be $1.43 to $1.49 versus $1.32 for the 13 weeks ended July 23, 2023.  \n Our guidance assumptions for the second quarter of 2024 include the following. Total sales are forecast to increase 5% to 7% versus the prior year. We expect to open 24 locations in the second quarter, including 21 Ross and 3 dd's locations. If same-store sales perform in line with our forecast, operating margin for the second quarter is projected to be in the 11.5% to 11.8% range compared to 11.3% in 2023. Higher sales and lower incentive and distribution costs are expected to be partially offset by a decline in merchandise margin as we build on our efforts to offer more sharply priced brands. We expect net interest income to be approximately $37 million. The tax rate is projected to be about 25%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 332 million. \n Now turning to the full year. Based on our first quarter results and forward guidance, comparable store sales for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, remain unchanged at up 2% to 3%. We now project earnings per share for the 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025, to be in the range of $5.79 to $5.98 compared to $5.56 for the 53 weeks ended February 3, 2024. This guidance range includes an approximate $0.02 per share favorable impact from the timing of expenses that benefited the first quarter. As a reminder, fiscal 2023 earnings per share included a benefit of approximately $0.20 from the 53rd week. \n Now I will turn the call back to Barbara Rentler for closing comments. Yes. Lorraine, this is Adam. I'll jump in on that. So higher-quality branded merchandise will typically carry lower margins relative to lower quality, less recognizable brands. So as we move through the year, this will be pressured throughout the year, but will be even more so in the back half of fiscal 2024 as we continue to make further progress on this, as Barbara talked about. We really feel like long term, this is the right thing for us to do to position us to capture market share going forward. I'll take the first part, Mike. I appreciate the spirit of your question, but you're right. So domestic -- so let me just kind of walk through all the parts, right? So the EPS beat and operating margin benefit, lower distribution costs. \n So we had higher productivity in our distribution centers. We opened a new facility in Houston a couple of years ago. So that's getting fully ramped up. So that's providing productivity benefits. I would say on the DC cost front, the hiring environment and the retention environment is favorable. And we've also made investments in productivity in the distribution centers. And then lastly on that front, I'd say that the $0.02 of benefit that we talked about in timing is largely packaway benefit that kind of impacts the DC cost. \n We had better -- as expected, we had better domestic freight costs in the quarter. I would expect that to continue through the balance of the year at somewhat -- it'll be a little bit choppy, but at somewhat similar levels. We went through a bidding process, felt good about those results. As we sit here today, fuel slightly helping us versus last year. \n And then as we've talked about for some time, incentives. Some good news in Q1, that'll be winded our back through the balance of the year. So even though we had strong profitability into Q1, we're still up against 2023 where we significantly outperformed our plans. Likely stays with us through the balance of the year. But not -- just clarifying, not at the level we saw in Q1, right? So the Q1 number that we reported is -- it has the benefit of the packaway timing right? So that's -- step back that in a tangible way. And on the comp components, average basket was up slightly. So we had higher AUR driven by a higher mix of brands and is partially offset by lower units per transaction. Yes, and the DC cost. But the pressure is still there from where we have to take statutory increases, right? And that's where we're -- as Michael said and as I said earlier, that's where we're working hard, to try to find offsets to them. We think ocean freight will be neutral the balance of the year and it's more of a transit time issue than a cost. Alex, so domestic freight, it was favorable in Q1; expected to be favorable, the balance of the year, assuming fuel stays where it is. We talked about distribution cost. Feel good about productivity levels, the hiring environment, we'd expect that to continue the balance of the year. Merchandise margin is probably the big call-out, that we were below last year in Q1 and expect that to get -- to be further below last year as we move through the quarter, as we get further into the branded strategy that Barbara spoke of. \n I think back to the -- I guess, your pre-COVID question, still bullish on our ability to drive leverage, so again, anywhere between a 3% and a 4% comp. We believe we'll have operating margin leverage. It'll take -- to get back to pre-COVID levels, it'll take outsized comp sales growth. That's the most important variable. And I think the kind of the biggest variables are where fuel prices over time and assuming that wages continue to stabilize."

            "name": "Michael Hartshorn",
            "content": "Michael, there's one other nuance in the first quarter. The -- because your sales are based on a fiscal basis, your comps are on a restated. There's an outsized impact between your total sales and your comp sales because of that disconnect that corrects itself through the year. So we actually get higher leverage in the first quarter. Longer term, though, we would still expect the leverage at 3% to 4%. \n On dd's, as we said in the commentary, sales trends were ahead of Ross. That's due, in part, to the easier prior year comparisons, but also shoppers responded favorably to our improved value offerings. I would say we're just at the beginning stages of making merchandise adjustments there to improve the value offerings. And while we're encouraged by the initial customer response, it's still very, very early. Matthew, that's a lot to take in, but I'll start with the health of the consumer. I would say it's hard to say on the health of the consumer. There's clearly a lot of uncertainty in the macro economy. The silver lining for our business is the customer is seeking value more than ever, and we're in a position to deliver that. \n In terms of cadence, as you know, we typically do not get into what the monthly cadence is. I would say that the performance during the quarter was choppy throughout the quarter with weather, the Easter calendar shift and tax refund timing. For us, even though weather was choppy during the quarter, it was relatively neutral for the entire quarter. Chuck, on the -- on dd's, as I said, part of the performance was against easier prior year comparisons than Ross. But we do believe that we've started making adjustments, and the customer is responding. And I'll just repeat, we think we're at the very early stages of making the merchandise adjustments we need to make. So we'll see how it progresses through the year. Within the cost of goods sold, Tracy, freight is included in our cost of goods sold, and we did see favorability. Adrienne, just on -- before the packaway, packaway usually stays in about -- the average is about 4 months. That said, you could obviously use it for short stay if you needed to. Sure, Bob. I would only talk on a consolidated basis. But as we said in the commentary, the geographic performance was strongest in California and the Pacific Northwest. Both of those are areas that were impacted by poor weather last year, so easier compare perhaps. For our other largest markets, Texas was above the chain while Florida was just slightly below. On AUR, I'd say we don't plan or focus on driving a specific price point. While it was up in the first quarter, our focus is on delivering the most compelling value as possible, which, as we said, we believe will drive sales and market share gains. It's a good question. I think right now, as you know, we slowed down growth specifically in the new markets. I think we'll have to see sustained trends before we reaccelerate growth in those newer markets. But if we see it, then we would do so. Aneesha, on the guidance, I mean I would say it's our best assessment of where the business is and the merchandising plans we have to further increase the branded bargains we offer as we progress through the year. As you know and as you look at the stack comps, we have, for many years now, had stronger comps beyond the first quarter. So we believe we plan the business appropriately based on what we know. \n On wages, I would say, generally speaking, wages on our stores and DCs are relatively stable. In fact, part of the productivity improvements in the DCs in the first quarter is lower turnover, which mean we had more tenured associates and they were more productive. So I think we feel good about the -- where we are with wages. And like we always have, we'll take a market-by-market approach. And where we need to raise wages, we will. In terms of inventory, part of the increase, Laura, was that with the fiscal calendar, restated calendar at fiscal year-end, we were 1 month closer to Mother's Day where we tend to drive receipts. So that's why you see in-store inventory position up 4%. I'd say the other factor is we do have more goods in transit. Part of that is due to the Suez Canal, and we're going around the Horn of Africa. So that creates a little bit more of in-transit inventory coming into the country. It's actually relatively flat for the rest of the year in terms of ocean freight, and we do have the -- we do have our contracts locked in at this point, including the Suez Canal shipments. Marni, we're just showing up in your feeds. No, our marketing strategy has stayed fairly consistent. We have -- like everybody else over the years, have shifted more of our media to digital from broadcast, and maybe that's what you're seeing because we have more of our marketing in digital channels. I would say it's -- we've always done well with the younger customer, and we continue to do well with the younger customer. When we look at the performance, say, Q4 and Q1, it's been fairly broad-based across trade area demographics, and that includes income. So from an income standpoint, it's hard to pinpoint whether there's increasingly a trade-down customer. But what it does say is we're attracting a very broad customer base, which is good for us. The biggest difference is, though, in gross margin between pre-COVID levels are freight costs that spiked during COVID. They're still pretty sticky with driver wages, but we made progress last year. We're going to make progress again. And then the other big factor is in our distribution center with wages, and you see that at least in the first quarter, we had good productivity gains. So both of those, we believe, we can track back over time, again, depending on the macro economy when it comes to fuel prices on freight."
