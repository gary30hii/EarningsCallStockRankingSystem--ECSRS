Afterwards, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded it\u2019s Tuesday, November 10, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Thank you, Eric. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 10, 2021. And with that, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we with the effects of the pandemic. At FICO we continue to make the health and safety of our employees a priority and are primarily working from home with most of our offices remaining closed. I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their perseverance and their adaptability and their commitment to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that I will reference during our presentation today. 2020 has been a remarkable year for all of us. At FICO we have been focused on navigating an extremely volatile and unpredictable environment. I am happy to report that our Q4 results again demonstrate not only the quality of our management team, but also the resilience of our business model. In our fourth quarter, we posted exceptional results that capped off a very successful fiscal year. We reported record revenues of $374 million, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, we recorded $1.9 -- $1.29 billion of revenue, up 12% from fiscal 2019. We delivered $59 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.98 per share, even after taking a large charge and restructuring and impairment losses. On a non-GAAP basis, the $3.25 earnings per share was up 62% from last year. And we are delivering strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $135 million, up 51% from last year. Total fiscal year \u201820 free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from fiscal \u201819. We had another solid year throughout our business and our Applications segment we had a great quarter of 12% versus last year in large part due to some Falcon license renewals. For the year, the segment was essentially flat for good result considering we entered the year with difficult comps as a result of large license sales in fiscal \u201819. Applications bookings in the quarter were $117 million, up 42% over the same period last year, and $282 million for the full year, up 6% versus fiscal \u201819. In our Decision Management segment, we continue to prove that we are gaining traction with our new technology. We again delivered our largest DMS revenue quarter ever, up 36% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter and the segment was up 22% for the full year versus fiscal 2009 [ph]. Our bookings were even more impressive. We signed $99 million in new DMS deals this quarter, up 62% from the same quarter last year. For the full year we signed $199 million of new DMS deals, up 27% versus last year. Let me take a few moments to highlight the DMS success this quarter. First, we signed the biggest single platform in Centralized Decision Solution in company history with a large Latin American bank. The bank is looking to implement 19 different instances on our platform to derive the decision to support use cases related to auto, credit line management for the different retail products, and collections and others on the corporate platform. We are signing more deals and bigger deals as we find operators eager to use our advanced analytic tools to automate their most difficult decisions. We continue to focus our strategy of investing for platform success, we have been making coordinated changes across the business to grow revenue from our on-platform solutions, favorite software-over-services, optimize pricing and manage operating expenses. In our fourth quarter, we made some changes, including reducing headcount and some of our facilities footprint. Those were announced in September when we disclosed the charge we would be taking. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we also made the decision to exit our FICO Cyber Risk Score business which we sold to institutional shareholder services last month. We don\u2019t make these decisions lightly. We are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we need to be focused on that mission. That may mean exiting non-strategic products or not signing or renewing low margin project work. We are constantly looking at our business to identify areas for growth and improvement, and implement actions to deliver our strategic initiatives. We will continue to keep you updated on the progress we are making in our Software business and we will be providing more information in the coming quarters to explain the transformation we are making there. In our Scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 32% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 25% for the full year. On the B2B side revenues were up 27% as we saw continued strong mortgage origination volumes. We saw a small rebound in auto originations in the quarter, while cards and other personal loan volumes continued to be down. The quarter also included a one-time true-up of royalty revenues. For the full year B2B revenues were up 26% compared to 2019. Our B2C revenues were up 45% versus the same quarter last year and 23% for the full year compared to last year. We continue to see incredible growth in myFICO.com, which was up 62% this quarter versus last year and are also getting good growth through our partners. As we look to our fiscal 2021, we see customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation and looking to our technology to facilitate the process. But we are also faced with a number of uncertainties. Obviously, we are all still dealing with the ongoing pandemic and all of the resulting health and economic impacts. We may see a new stimulus package from the federal government but with the just completed elections it\u2019s difficult to predict any timing or impacts. It\u2019s also difficult to predict what we will see in debt markets in the coming year. Obviously, the mortgage markets have been growing at phenomenal levels, but we can\u2019t predict when or to what degree those markets will cool off. In auto and personal loans, there\u2019s still a great deal of volatility and we cannot confidently predict how the next 12 months will play out. As in past years, we have instituted some pricing increases in various areas within Scores. But it\u2019s also difficult to determine their potential impact because of volume uncertainty. We are coming off a quarter with record revenues and record bookings. But again, with an ongoing pandemic, it\u2019s difficult to predict with certainty how quickly our solutions from the new sales will be implemented. In addition, our subscription-based go-to-market strategy will have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition in fiscal \u201821, causing less revenue to be claimed up front and more to be taken rapidly, which Mike will described in his remarks. We are proud of our business performed in fiscal \u201820 and are excited as we embark on a new year. But we are also realistic and understanding that we are in unprecedented times with many uncertainties. Because of this, we remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible, but are not providing guidance for fiscal \u201821 at this time. Have some final comments in a few minutes. But first let me turn the call over to Mike for more financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we had a great finish to our fiscal year and we are able to post exceptional results in the midst of a tumultuous business environment. Revenue for the quarter was $374 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.29 billion was up 12% over last year. Within our three reported business segments, our Application revenues were $168 billion, up 12% versus the same period last year. The quarterly increase in revenue was driven by increased term license sales, including an unusually high number of large multiyear license renewals. Full year revenues for Applications were $602 million roughly flat with last year. Applications bookings were up 42% over the same quarter last year and up 6% for the full year. In our Decision Management Software segment Q4 revenues were $53 million, up 36% over the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $164 million, up 22% from fiscal \u201819. The revenue increases for both the quarter and the year were due to increase license sales, as well as increased SaaS subscription revenue. Q4 DMS bookings were $99 million, up 62% from the previous year. For the full year DMS bookings of $199 million were up 27% over last year. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $153 million, up 32% from the same period last year. The B2B part of the business was up 27% over the same period, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations and a one-time true-up of past royalties. B2C revenues were up 45% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. For the full year, Scores revenues were $529 million, up to 25% from last year. This quarter\u2019s 74% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 18% and the remaining 8% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues, consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total quarterly revenues and licensed revenues were 16% of the total. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues for the full year of fiscal 2019 were $237 million, up 11% from fiscal 2019. We had record total bookings in Q4 of $235 million, up 46% from the previous year. These bookings generated $34 million of current period revenues, which is a 15% yield. Full year bookings of $537 million represent an 11% increase from last year. SaaS bookings were $221 million for the year, up 18% from 2019. As you may recall, our total bookings lagged in Q2 and Q3 of this year due to disruptions from the pandemic. But the strong finish put us in line with our annual expectations. Our operating expenses totaled $289 million this quarter, including $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges expenses were $247 million, compared to $231 million in the prior quarter, up $16 million due to increased expenses associated with additional revenue and incentives expenses. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 41% for the quarter and 34% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 400 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter, which again included one-time charges was $59 million, up 8% from Q4 and fiscal 2019. Our non-GAAP net income was $97 million for the quarter, up 59% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $236, including $45 million of restructuring impairment charges, and $50 million of reduced tax expense from one-time excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million, up 28% from prior year. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 8%, including the $50 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%, compared with 28% at FY \u201820. That expected recurring tax rate is before an estimated excess tax benefit of approximately $20 million in FY 2021. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 20% in fiscal \u201821. Free cash for the quarter was $135 million, compared to $90 million in the same period last year, an increase of 51%. For the full year free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from last year\u2019s $236 million. Turning to balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $157 million in cash. This is up $32 million from last quarter due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by $25 million of share repurchases. Our total debt now stands at $845 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 60,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $423 per share. In fiscal 2020 we repurchased a total of 675,000 shares at an average price of $348 per share for a total of $235 million. At the end of September we had about $225 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and we continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, as well mentioned, we have recently shifted the sales of our on premise software, away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and the ongoing maintenance. As a result at the beginning of FY21, we adjusted our revenue recognition assumptions to be consistent with industry standards for software subscription sales. This change will result in less upfront revenue recognized in the year we sign subscription contracts, and more revenue from those contracts recognized ratably during their term. This will likely result in a material decline of our software license revenues in fiscal \u201821. As a greater percentage of the total expected revenue to be received from newly signed on-premise subscription sales and renewals of existing term licenses or spread over the term of the deal. This will not have an impact on our cash flows, or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY21.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said, in my opening remarks, I am proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish in fiscal 20. I am excited about our prospects are 2021 and beyond. Clearly, there is uncertainty. But we are confident that our future is bright. We can\u2019t pin down exact expectations, but we have proven our businesses remarkably resilient. And we are well positioned for the future. We will continue to innovate fine tune and improve our business model with an eye toward improving margins and delivering on our potential. And we look forward to keep you all informed as we progress. Now, let\u2019s turn to Q&A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our remarks. Eric, if you could please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just on the software business clearly, a solid end to the year to you. You characterize it as a backlog that kind of pause because of the pandemic. But I was hoping you could give us just a little bit more color on how the clients are viewing the next few quarters ahead I guess. Is the fact that you ended strong just find that they are back to normal or is there some shift in where they are finding these deals?\nWill Lansing: Hi, Manav. I think that, I wouldn\u2019t say things are back to normal. But I would also say that with respect to the software that banks buy from us, things didn\u2019t change that much. Remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 270 days on average. And so a lot of what we have booked in 2020 was pipeline built even earlier. We are now in the process of building pipeline for 2021. We have some pipeline built. We have more to build. And it\u2019s a little hard to say how it will all turn out. But I would say that our customers are they have the same needs for the software that they had before the pandemic, if anything, there is increased appetite, because the pandemic has gotten everyone focused on digital transformation. And, and our software obviously plays really well for that. So I anticipate continued interest, I don\u2019t think we are just working off backlog.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. And then if I may just on the score side, plus can you just quantify how much the two upgrades that he talked about? And then secondly, just going into next calendar year, I guess, how should we think about the pricing initiatives that you have been doing in the last few years, like, should we be expecting another one?\nWill Lansing: We can\u2019t disclose the amount of the true that\u2019s held confidential. But as you know, these things happen every several years. We wind up doing a trip of this sort. With respect to the pricing actions and scores, we took some actions, but as in years past, we don\u2019t really know exactly how it will feather in we don\u2019t know exactly what volumes will be. And so it\u2019s a little hard to predict. I would say not a lot more nor a lot less than years past is probably a way to think about it. But it\u2019s -- we have uncertainty, we always -- we wind up getting the activity and or from the Bureau\u2019s and that\u2019s just the way it is.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And if I can just squeeze in one minute just selling this hybris core business to ISS, I guess. I don\u2019t know if you have ever sold a prune portfolio before. So I was just curious it\u2019s something is there a fresh milk is a lot more that maybe we can see coming?\nWill Lansing: Yes. Good question, Manav. We have undertaken a pretty massive strategic look at our business over the last six, seven months. We hired in a former McKinsey Director, Tab Bowers to help us. And we have been really focused on what is strategic and what is not. And so we are -- the things that look promising, but they really are not central to our mission for building a decisioning platform, are definitely being moved to the periphery and cyber risk course example, when those sold, we are proud of it. It was good technology. But our success in the decisioning platform business doesn\u2019t turn on whether we are successful in cyber risk score. So at some level was a distraction for us. Are there other things like that we are in a state of constant evaluation, and we hope to find some things that are less strategic and free up resources for more strategic.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to touch a little bit on the SG&A trajectory, you guys took some restructuring kind of rationalized headcount in real estate, how should we think about kind of the expense trends over the next coming year given that, it seems like some of these efficiencies could be permanent, but not sure whether you guys are going to reinvest part of that in some higher growth areas such as DMS.\nWill Lansing: Yes. I will give you some quantitative thoughts. And then maybe we will can provide qualitative. Big part of the reduction in expense run rate in the second half of the year with T&E. You can see from the additional slides we provide, as a part of this call that are going into the pandemic, T&E run rate was about $30 million to $35 million a year. I think it was something like $100,000 in Q4. So that\u2019s not going to persist, but it\u2019s probably going to be less than 30 to 35. So even if we do have a vaccine and get back to normal. So that\u2019s one moving piece. We have also taken action to reduce our geographic footprint and to a minor extent reduce headcount in non-strategic areas that real estate saving will accrue over the years. And so that will be a one way benefit. That isn\u2019t going to change. But with respect to some of the headcount reductions, we actually did that so that we could reinvest, if not all of that money into headcount augmentation in areas related to the software platform, to pursue our strategic ambitions there. So we expect overall expenses for the business, probably, again with the pandemic so much is uncertain. But we expect flat to single digit growth and expenses as the year goes on, maybe we will do better than that. If perversely, we can travel for the whole full year. Hopefully, we can and we have some money to spend in that category. But hopefully, that at least gives you some color.\nKyle Peterson: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color. And like it\u2019s just more of a housekeeping item, particularly on some of these longer term licensed sales that you guys recognize this quarter. Was that more on the application side? Just trying to think about how we should incorporate that into our model moving forward?\nWill Lansing: Yes. If you look at the segment breakout in the 10-K, you can figure that out, you have to do a little quarterly subtraction math, because we don\u2019t show the quarter-over-quarter comparison in a friendly way as we might. But the licensed growth was really driven by renewals. We had a healthy new business license sale quarter as well as we would expect in the fourth quarter of particularly given some of the delayed purchases that flowed over from Q2, Q3. But if you look at our $62.5 million of licensed bookings for the quarter, which is up of that $21 million or so is renewal that renewals in excess of renewals we had in the year ago quarter. So -- and then just for better, worse, they are lumpy, we have to recognize a lot of upfront. And so, it was both increase in new business sales, which was up sort of mid to high teens from year-over-year, but most of the increase, but not always, just by this lumpiness of renewals that happened to be a whopper renewal quarter.\nKyle Peterson: All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thanks and good evening everyone. I wanted to ask on B2C scores, kind of a really, really good quarter. On the myFICO side recognize you have a strong brand, recognize the direct is the part of the market that\u2019s been performing well lately, but anything that you have changed for myFICO, either in terms of go to market or product or just any other changes that are driving that exceptionally strong result?\nWill Lansing: I would say it\u2019s more on the market side than on our side, but we are constantly innovating over there. We are constantly pushing the -- trying to push the value that the consumer gets in that offering. Our strategy around myFICO is to be kind of best-in-class credit monitoring for consumers. And at the same time, we mostly go to market through partners like Experian. And so, myFICO is at some level of laboratory for us, a place to test out ideas, to test out value proposition changes. And so, we are always doing that. That\u2019s not like a new thing this year, we constantly do that. I think that the biggest thing responsible for the lift is consumer demand. And then the consumer is really interested in tracking his or her credit score.\nJeff Meuler: Yep. Okay. And then Mike, just on these accounting changes, I just want to make sure that -- I guess a couple of clarifying questions, but there\u2019s no change to the timing of expense recognition would be one question. And then my guess is -- are you viewing booking as kind of the best way to track the performance of the business throughout 2021? And I think that\u2019s unaffected? Or is there some other kind of metric or some way that you are going to be adjusting revenue to give us a like for like impact or something to track the performance of the business as we progress through 2021?\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks for those two questions. The first one definitely merits some additional detail, I think for everyone listening in the call. So the change really is to get in line with industry standard for how subscription software is recognized. We had been recognized revenue for on-premise term license sale essentially in the way that you would recognize a perpetual license sale where you had a one-time license upfront and then 20% maintenance every year. We were treating the total contract value of term license in sort of the same way. That lead to about between 80% and 85% of the total contract value for a multi-year deal being recognized in the year you sign it, when you sign it, and only 17% -- 15% to 20% recognized ratably in years two and three. With this change, again, which is what the vast majority of subscription software companies already do, we are shifting that revenue recognition to better reflect the fact that the value of the ongoing support and maintenance for the on-prem software in a term license as opposed to a professional license situation is higher than what we had been recognizing before. That nets out to about a 30% reduction in the percent of TCV, contract value recognized in year one versus years two, three, and in some cases years four and five. So when you think about the revenue side, and I know you have asked about the expense side as well, we had $120 8 million of license revenue in our software business in fiscal 2020. Going forward, we would recognize about 30% less of that in the first year and 30% will then be recognized as recurring revenue in the remaining years of the contract. So it\u2019s all about revenue recognition for accounting purposes. It doesn\u2019t change when we build a customer, how much we build them, or what total revenue will recognize over the term of a contract. So, hopefully, that\u2019s clear. And you can do your own math on how much of a headwind that will be for revenue, but it will be a headwind for fiscal 2021 for sure. We want to make sure everybody notice that. With respect to expenses, these are on-prem license sales. So there aren\u2019t that much -- there isn\u2019t that much expense associated with it. Margins -- our on-prem business are consistent with what others earn 90 plus percent. So that -- but it will change revenue recognition a little bit to the extent that we recognize more revenue ratably we match expense with the revenue recognition, but that\u2019s not going to be a material impact relative to the revenue impact. And then you asked about booking, separate question. Yes, for now, that\u2019s the best indicator to measure our current period performance in generating new revenue. It\u2019s not a perfect metric, as you know it\u2019s on a TCV basis, so term length matters, but we are sticking with that metric for now. As we move more to a subscription and SaaS business, annual recurring revenue and its derivatives becomes more important to us. And we do expect to be able to expose to you guys at some point during this fiscal year, just kind of metrics for FIFO, but we are not ready to do that yet.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. Sorry for the three partner. I appreciate all the detail.\nMike McLaughlin: Thank you for the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Huff with Stephens Incorporated. Please go ahead.\nBrett Huff: Good afternoon, guys.\nWill Lansing: Hi, Brett.\nBrett Huff: Good. Just a quick follow up on pricing. Could you guys give us a sense -- I think sometimes you have given us a sense of which part of scoring you sort of dug into and we are tweaking the pricing on? Could you - any insight there that you could share with us for this new round of price tweaks?\nWill Lansing: Yes. To the extent we are willing to share that information, it\u2019s less to do with the type of scores and it\u2019s more to do with the size of the customer. So we are into a more kind of a tiered pricing philosophy. And so I would say that the price increases were spread across the spread -- scores portfolio with a view to the size of the customer buying the scores.\nBrett Huff: And I am assuming that that the smaller customers may have been getting a pretty good deal for a long time and maybe we are tweaking that based on just volumes.\nWill Lansing: Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And I would say they are still getting a good deal, but not as good a deal.\nBrett Huff: In terms of bank buying behavior, you touched on this a couple of times. I know your sales cycles are long. And so, when things exactly come out of the pipe and get booked, I know it takes a while. But as you are having conversations with folks, I know you mentioned digitization is really important. But as you think about Falcon\u2019s strategy director, debt collector, sort of those key apps, any sort of detail on the conversations there that that stick out that might be useful to know?\nWill Lansing: What\u2019s interesting is, historically, we have provided for lack of a better term point solutions for our bank customers, originations and customer management and fraud and collections and recovery as you know. What we are seeing -- what we saw last year and what we are starting to see more of is more engagement with the IT department, more engaged with the CIO, and a better understanding on the part of our customers have just the benefits and value of the platform. So while they may still be buying a solution like originations, now they appreciate that it\u2019s originations on top of the platform. And there is all kinds of potential that goes with that where for small incremental investments they get large incremental value out. I think that\u2019s the biggest change we are seeing in the conversation is customers increasingly understanding our strategy around platform and looking to leverage it.\nBrett Huff: Okay. And then any update on the sort of the master plan of moving everything over to sort of the core underlying DMS platform on the app side. Can you just -- sometimes you sort of say we expect Falcon going to be completely done in a year or whatever. Can you just give us the update on that to remind us where we are in terms of finish line?\nWill Lansing: Yes. So I guess the honest answer is our work is never done. Okay. So it\u2019s not like we will just say, okay. Now it\u2019s on the platform, we can all go home. It\u2019s a process. And so we have moved some core fraud applications from Falcon onto the platform. Our compliance is now available in Falcon X on the platform. We are also looking at, I would say, more flexible and modular approaches to providing fraud solutions on the platform. So there will be some of that. Some of our applications aren\u2019t going to make it to the platform. So, for example, collections and recovery has a massive code base, 8 million lines of code. And it just doesn\u2019t make sense to rewrite it onto the platform. And so that will remain a distinct code base. So, when are we done? I guess another way to think of it is, when are we going to feel that the platform is sufficiently mature that customers who want to have multiple use cases on the platform have that work? I think we are almost there. Now, we are pretty much there. This Latin American bank deal that we just referenced, it started out with a conversation about a handful of use cases that they would want to do on the platform and they we are up to 19. And I think there\u2019s more in the future. So it\u2019s a different way of thinking about the value that we provide.\nBrett Huff: Great. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jake Williams with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJake Williams: Good evening, everyone.\nWill Lansing: Hi, Jake.\nJake Williams: Can you help us to understand how much of an impact mortgage items were in this quarter in the B2B Square segment?\nWill Lansing: Like last quarter, Experian -- Equifax and TransUnion reported before us last week and end of the prior week, and you can see how they broke out mortgage volumes. We don\u2019t break out mortgage volumes, but we can say that what we saw was consistent with what they told The Street they saw. I think one showed up 45% in terms of volume and the other was closer to 60%, although it\u2019s a little unclear whether that was for the quarter itself or sort of run rate including the last -- including the month of October, but our volumes were consistent with what you could see from them.\nJake Williams: Got it. And then in terms in the average bookings term stretched out to 55 months this quarter from 37 was that impacted by the decision to change the revenue recognition on-prem or is this an independent evolution?\nWill Lansing: No. It\u2019s independent. It\u2019s not related to that. What is related to is we had some deals that are really long-term deals long, much longer than typical than has been our usual. And I would say that that trend could continue. We will have to see how things play out. But I think when banks adopt our platform and standardize on the platform, it\u2019s not surprising that they would want to lock us in for a long period of time with an understanding of what it\u2019s going to cost. So I think there\u2019s going to be pressure for longer-term deals on us.\nJake Williams: So can we assume that the clients are the ones who are coming to you asking for this long-term deal to give them stability and in return there\u2019s probably some price escalator built-in each year.\nWill Lansing: Yes. We try to be smart about it and yes it\u2019s definitely client request.\nJake Williams: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon. Following up on earlier question about just the DMS platform, maybe can you provide a little bit more color on the investments you are making in terms of the -- you are redirecting some of the 36 billion in savings that you have towards additional headcount for the build out of that platform. Is that simply we are just trying to accelerate the build out of certain functionality? I was just hoping for maybe a better understanding of where the roadmap is in terms of, I think, ultimately we are trying to get to, I guess, in terms of the function that we currently have versus where it will be fairly equivalent product to your on-prem and in your old architecture cloud stuff?\nWill Lansing: So part of the strategy of the platform is to is to have a lot of interoperability around the data, right? So we have a data orchestration layer. We can take data from lots of different places and bring it into the platform. And then we have a wide range of analytics that can be applied to that data. And then we have various solutions that sit on top of that platform, of that decision platform to meet specific needs. Our strategy with the platform has been to -- as we migrate our applications to the platform, the way we think about it is we say, what are the components of this solution that we ought to modularize, what are the micro services that are involved here and let\u2019s break them up and make them available to users of the platform, so they can be mixed and matched in different ways. And so that\u2019s really kind of the heavy lifting that\u2019s going on. We have also put a lot of energy into a thing called FICO Studio, which is kind of a front end fourth generation language kind of a programming environment where you can drag and drop a lot of things to build workflows based on the decisioning analytics in the platform. So there\u2019s a lot of work that\u2019s gone into that. But the way we think about it is not let\u2019s port an application to the platform. It\u2019s more break up the application into its component parts, understand how they can be micro services that could be consumed in independently and then bring those to the platform so they can be reassembled on the platform for all different kinds of purposes.\nSurinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just a bigger picture question, obviously with a potential change in the administration, is there any other considerations that enter into picture here where maybe could there be, let\u2019s say, an acceleration in the upgrade cycle for, let\u2019s say, from FICO 8 to FICO 9 or even to FICO 10 or something for that matter that might drive based on the differences in the policy administrations.\nWill Lansing: I am not sure that we will have a change in the rate and pace of adoption of new scores under -- based on the administration. I do think that all lenders are really focused right now on how do they get the most value out of scoring algorithms and they are increasingly using things like FICO resiliency index to complement the traditional FICO score to make these decisions. I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s driven by the administration. I think that\u2019s more driven by the innovation coming out of our scores team. But there\u2019s a tremendous appetite on the side of the banks to get the full benefit out of it. And so, we are pretty focused on that.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. And then just a quick one on -- or maybe on the B2C revenues obviously really strong growth there. I am assuming the run rate is what is a sustainable run rate at this point? Is there any color you can provide on how -- is this just -- there\u2019s just this initial phase where we should expect this big ramp up that we have seen with the kind of the dislocation in the markets? Or how should we think about the growth rate forward should\u2026\nWill Lansing: I think that we definitely\u2026\nSurinder Thind: \u2026I am a little bit or how long do customers stay on the platform?\nWill Lansing: I think we have definitely enjoyed a spike because of the environment. There\u2019s no question that consumers are more focused than ever on their score and whether it\u2019s going up or down, I get letters in the mail all the time. And that\u2019s definitely the environment driving that. So I would say the 62% spike I referenced earlier that is -- that\u2019s driven by the environment. In terms of the lifetime value, how long they stay on. We have not -- it\u2019s too early to tell, but we haven\u2019t seen changes. So what we are seeing so far is kind of the same attrition over time that we have historically had. So we will stay.\nSurinder Thind: Okay.\nWill Lansing: What we have noticed is that there\u2019s an inexorable trend to consumers being ever more focused on their credit score. I mean, this has been every year, year in, year out has become bigger and more important to them. And so, I am not sure that it\u2019s like a spike up and then a ramp down. I mean, it may just be part of a trend.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. Thank you. And Mr. Weber, we have no further questions from the phones at this time. I will turn the call back to you.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. This concludes our call today. Thank you all for joining, and we will look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mike McLaughlin",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we had a great finish to our fiscal year and we are able to post exceptional results in the midst of a tumultuous business environment. Revenue for the quarter was $374 million, an increase of 23% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.29 billion was up 12% over last year. Within our three reported business segments, our Application revenues were $168 billion, up 12% versus the same period last year. The quarterly increase in revenue was driven by increased term license sales, including an unusually high number of large multiyear license renewals. Full year revenues for Applications were $602 million roughly flat with last year. Applications bookings were up 42% over the same quarter last year and up 6% for the full year. In our Decision Management Software segment Q4 revenues were $53 million, up 36% over the same period last year. Full year DMS revenues were $164 million, up 22% from fiscal \u201819. The revenue increases for both the quarter and the year were due to increase license sales, as well as increased SaaS subscription revenue. Q4 DMS bookings were $99 million, up 62% from the previous year. For the full year DMS bookings of $199 million were up 27% over last year. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $153 million, up 32% from the same period last year. The B2B part of the business was up 27% over the same period, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations and a one-time true-up of past royalties. B2C revenues were up 45% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. For the full year, Scores revenues were $529 million, up to 25% from last year. This quarter's 74% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 18% and the remaining 8% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 71% of total revenues, consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total quarterly revenues and licensed revenues were 16% of the total. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues for the full year of fiscal 2019 were $237 million, up 11% from fiscal 2019. We had record total bookings in Q4 of $235 million, up 46% from the previous year. These bookings generated $34 million of current period revenues, which is a 15% yield. Full year bookings of $537 million represent an 11% increase from last year. SaaS bookings were $221 million for the year, up 18% from 2019. As you may recall, our total bookings lagged in Q2 and Q3 of this year due to disruptions from the pandemic. But the strong finish put us in line with our annual expectations. Our operating expenses totaled $289 million this quarter, including $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges expenses were $247 million, compared to $231 million in the prior quarter, up $16 million due to increased expenses associated with additional revenue and incentives expenses. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 41% for the quarter and 34% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 400 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter, which again included one-time charges was $59 million, up 8% from Q4 and fiscal 2019. Our non-GAAP net income was $97 million for the quarter, up 59% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $236, including $45 million of restructuring impairment charges, and $50 million of reduced tax expense from one-time excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. Non-GAAP net income was $292 million, up 28% from prior year. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 8%, including the $50 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%, compared with 28% at FY \u201820. That expected recurring tax rate is before an estimated excess tax benefit of approximately $20 million in FY 2021. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 20% in fiscal \u201821. Free cash for the quarter was $135 million, compared to $90 million in the same period last year, an increase of 51%. For the full year free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from last year's $236 million. Turning to balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $157 million in cash. This is up $32 million from last quarter due to cash generated from operations, partially offset by $25 million of share repurchases. Our total debt now stands at $845 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.3%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 60,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $423 per share. In fiscal 2020 we repurchased a total of 675,000 shares at an average price of $348 per share for a total of $235 million. At the end of September we had about $225 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and we continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, as well mentioned, we have recently shifted the sales of our on premise software, away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and the ongoing maintenance. As a result at the beginning of FY21, we adjusted our revenue recognition assumptions to be consistent with industry standards for software subscription sales. This change will result in less upfront revenue recognized in the year we sign subscription contracts, and more revenue from those contracts recognized ratably during their term. This will likely result in a material decline of our software license revenues in fiscal \u201821. As a greater percentage of the total expected revenue to be received from newly signed on-premise subscription sales and renewals of existing term licenses or spread over the term of the deal. This will not have an impact on our cash flows, or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY21. Thanks for those two questions. The first one definitely merits some additional detail, I think for everyone listening in the call. So the change really is to get in line with industry standard for how subscription software is recognized. We had been recognized revenue for on-premise term license sale essentially in the way that you would recognize a perpetual license sale where you had a one-time license upfront and then 20% maintenance every year. We were treating the total contract value of term license in sort of the same way. That lead to about between 80% and 85% of the total contract value for a multi-year deal being recognized in the year you sign it, when you sign it, and only 17% -- 15% to 20% recognized ratably in years two and three. With this change, again, which is what the vast majority of subscription software companies already do, we are shifting that revenue recognition to better reflect the fact that the value of the ongoing support and maintenance for the on-prem software in a term license as opposed to a professional license situation is higher than what we had been recognizing before. That nets out to about a 30% reduction in the percent of TCV, contract value recognized in year one versus years two, three, and in some cases years four and five. So when you think about the revenue side, and I know you have asked about the expense side as well, we had $120 8 million of license revenue in our software business in fiscal 2020. Going forward, we would recognize about 30% less of that in the first year and 30% will then be recognized as recurring revenue in the remaining years of the contract. So it's all about revenue recognition for accounting purposes. It doesn't change when we build a customer, how much we build them, or what total revenue will recognize over the term of a contract. So, hopefully, that's clear. And you can do your own math on how much of a headwind that will be for revenue, but it will be a headwind for fiscal 2021 for sure. We want to make sure everybody notice that. With respect to expenses, these are on-prem license sales. So there aren't that much -- there isn't that much expense associated with it. Margins -- our on-prem business are consistent with what others earn 90 plus percent. So that -- but it will change revenue recognition a little bit to the extent that we recognize more revenue ratably we match expense with the revenue recognition, but that's not going to be a material impact relative to the revenue impact. And then you asked about booking, separate question. Yes, for now, that's the best indicator to measure our current period performance in generating new revenue. It's not a perfect metric, as you know it's on a TCV basis, so term length matters, but we are sticking with that metric for now. As we move more to a subscription and SaaS business, annual recurring revenue and its derivatives becomes more important to us. And we do expect to be able to expose to you guys at some point during this fiscal year, just kind of metrics for FIFO, but we are not ready to do that yet. Thank you for the questions."

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we with the effects of the pandemic. At FICO we continue to make the health and safety of our employees a priority and are primarily working from home with most of our offices remaining closed. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our entire team for their perseverance and their adaptability and their commitment to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that I will reference during our presentation today. 2020 has been a remarkable year for all of us. At FICO we have been focused on navigating an extremely volatile and unpredictable environment. I am happy to report that our Q4 results again demonstrate not only the quality of our management team, but also the resilience of our business model. In our fourth quarter, we posted exceptional results that capped off a very successful fiscal year. We reported record revenues of $374 million, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. For the full fiscal year, we recorded $1.9 -- $1.29 billion of revenue, up 12% from fiscal 2019. We delivered $59 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.98 per share, even after taking a large charge and restructuring and impairment losses. On a non-GAAP basis, the $3.25 earnings per share was up 62% from last year. And we are delivering strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $135 million, up 51% from last year. Total fiscal year \u201820 free cash flow was $343 million, up 45% from fiscal \u201819. We had another solid year throughout our business and our Applications segment we had a great quarter of 12% versus last year in large part due to some Falcon license renewals. For the year, the segment was essentially flat for good result considering we entered the year with difficult comps as a result of large license sales in fiscal \u201819. Applications bookings in the quarter were $117 million, up 42% over the same period last year, and $282 million for the full year, up 6% versus fiscal \u201819. In our Decision Management segment, we continue to prove that we are gaining traction with our new technology. We again delivered our largest DMS revenue quarter ever, up 36% from last year's fourth quarter and the segment was up 22% for the full year versus fiscal 2009 [ph]. Our bookings were even more impressive. We signed $99 million in new DMS deals this quarter, up 62% from the same quarter last year. For the full year we signed $199 million of new DMS deals, up 27% versus last year. Let me take a few moments to highlight the DMS success this quarter. First, we signed the biggest single platform in Centralized Decision Solution in company history with a large Latin American bank. The bank is looking to implement 19 different instances on our platform to derive the decision to support use cases related to auto, credit line management for the different retail products, and collections and others on the corporate platform. We are signing more deals and bigger deals as we find operators eager to use our advanced analytic tools to automate their most difficult decisions. We continue to focus our strategy of investing for platform success, we have been making coordinated changes across the business to grow revenue from our on-platform solutions, favorite software-over-services, optimize pricing and manage operating expenses. In our fourth quarter, we made some changes, including reducing headcount and some of our facilities footprint. Those were announced in September when we disclosed the charge we would be taking. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year, we also made the decision to exit our FICO Cyber Risk Score business which we sold to institutional shareholder services last month. We don't make these decisions lightly. We are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we need to be focused on that mission. That may mean exiting non-strategic products or not signing or renewing low margin project work. We are constantly looking at our business to identify areas for growth and improvement, and implement actions to deliver our strategic initiatives. We will continue to keep you updated on the progress we are making in our Software business and we will be providing more information in the coming quarters to explain the transformation we are making there. In our Scores business, we had another very successful year. Scores were up 32% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 25% for the full year. On the B2B side revenues were up 27% as we saw continued strong mortgage origination volumes. We saw a small rebound in auto originations in the quarter, while cards and other personal loan volumes continued to be down. The quarter also included a one-time true-up of royalty revenues. For the full year B2B revenues were up 26% compared to 2019. Our B2C revenues were up 45% versus the same quarter last year and 23% for the full year compared to last year. We continue to see incredible growth in myFICO.com, which was up 62% this quarter versus last year and are also getting good growth through our partners. As we look to our fiscal 2021, we see customers looking to accelerate their digital transformation and looking to our technology to facilitate the process. But we are also faced with a number of uncertainties. Obviously, we are all still dealing with the ongoing pandemic and all of the resulting health and economic impacts. We may see a new stimulus package from the federal government but with the just completed elections it's difficult to predict any timing or impacts. It's also difficult to predict what we will see in debt markets in the coming year. Obviously, the mortgage markets have been growing at phenomenal levels, but we can't predict when or to what degree those markets will cool off. In auto and personal loans, there's still a great deal of volatility and we cannot confidently predict how the next 12 months will play out. As in past years, we have instituted some pricing increases in various areas within Scores. But it's also difficult to determine their potential impact because of volume uncertainty. We are coming off a quarter with record revenues and record bookings. But again, with an ongoing pandemic, it's difficult to predict with certainty how quickly our solutions from the new sales will be implemented. In addition, our subscription-based go-to-market strategy will have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition in fiscal \u201821, causing less revenue to be claimed up front and more to be taken rapidly, which Mike will described in his remarks. We are proud of our business performed in fiscal \u201820 and are excited as we embark on a new year. But we are also realistic and understanding that we are in unprecedented times with many uncertainties. Because of this, we remain committed to providing as much transparency as possible, but are not providing guidance for fiscal \u201821 at this time. Have some final comments in a few minutes. But first let me turn the call over to Mike for more financial details. Thanks, Mike. As I said, in my opening remarks, I am proud of our team and what we were able to accomplish in fiscal 20. I am excited about our prospects are 2021 and beyond. Clearly, there is uncertainty. But we are confident that our future is bright. We can't pin down exact expectations, but we have proven our businesses remarkably resilient. And we are well positioned for the future. We will continue to innovate fine tune and improve our business model with an eye toward improving margins and delivering on our potential. And we look forward to keep you all informed as we progress. Now, let's turn to Q&A. Hi, Manav. I think that, I wouldn't say things are back to normal. But I would also say that with respect to the software that banks buy from us, things didn't change that much. Remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 270 days on average. And so a lot of what we have booked in 2020 was pipeline built even earlier. We are now in the process of building pipeline for 2021. We have some pipeline built. We have more to build. And it's a little hard to say how it will all turn out. But I would say that our customers are they have the same needs for the software that they had before the pandemic, if anything, there is increased appetite, because the pandemic has gotten everyone focused on digital transformation. And, and our software obviously plays really well for that. So I anticipate continued interest, I don't think we are just working off backlog. We can't disclose the amount of the true that's held confidential. But as you know, these things happen every several years. We wind up doing a trip of this sort. With respect to the pricing actions and scores, we took some actions, but as in years past, we don't really know exactly how it will feather in we don't know exactly what volumes will be. And so it's a little hard to predict. I would say not a lot more nor a lot less than years past is probably a way to think about it. But it's -- we have uncertainty, we always -- we wind up getting the activity and or from the Bureau's and that's just the way it is. Yes. Good question, Manav. We have undertaken a pretty massive strategic look at our business over the last six, seven months. We hired in a former McKinsey Director, Tab Bowers to help us. And we have been really focused on what is strategic and what is not. And so we are -- the things that look promising, but they really are not central to our mission for building a decisioning platform, are definitely being moved to the periphery and cyber risk course example, when those sold, we are proud of it. It was good technology. But our success in the decisioning platform business doesn't turn on whether we are successful in cyber risk score. So at some level was a distraction for us. Are there other things like that we are in a state of constant evaluation, and we hope to find some things that are less strategic and free up resources for more strategic. Yes. I will give you some quantitative thoughts. And then maybe we will can provide qualitative. Big part of the reduction in expense run rate in the second half of the year with T&E. You can see from the additional slides we provide, as a part of this call that are going into the pandemic, T&E run rate was about $30 million to $35 million a year. I think it was something like $100,000 in Q4. So that's not going to persist, but it's probably going to be less than 30 to 35. So even if we do have a vaccine and get back to normal. So that's one moving piece. We have also taken action to reduce our geographic footprint and to a minor extent reduce headcount in non-strategic areas that real estate saving will accrue over the years. And so that will be a one way benefit. That isn't going to change. But with respect to some of the headcount reductions, we actually did that so that we could reinvest, if not all of that money into headcount augmentation in areas related to the software platform, to pursue our strategic ambitions there. So we expect overall expenses for the business, probably, again with the pandemic so much is uncertain. But we expect flat to single digit growth and expenses as the year goes on, maybe we will do better than that. If perversely, we can travel for the whole full year. Hopefully, we can and we have some money to spend in that category. But hopefully, that at least gives you some color. Yes. If you look at the segment breakout in the 10-K, you can figure that out, you have to do a little quarterly subtraction math, because we don't show the quarter-over-quarter comparison in a friendly way as we might. But the licensed growth was really driven by renewals. We had a healthy new business license sale quarter as well as we would expect in the fourth quarter of particularly given some of the delayed purchases that flowed over from Q2, Q3. But if you look at our $62.5 million of licensed bookings for the quarter, which is up of that $21 million or so is renewal that renewals in excess of renewals we had in the year ago quarter. So -- and then just for better, worse, they are lumpy, we have to recognize a lot of upfront. And so, it was both increase in new business sales, which was up sort of mid to high teens from year-over-year, but most of the increase, but not always, just by this lumpiness of renewals that happened to be a whopper renewal quarter. I would say it's more on the market side than on our side, but we are constantly innovating over there. We are constantly pushing the -- trying to push the value that the consumer gets in that offering. Our strategy around myFICO is to be kind of best-in-class credit monitoring for consumers. And at the same time, we mostly go to market through partners like Experian. And so, myFICO is at some level of laboratory for us, a place to test out ideas, to test out value proposition changes. And so, we are always doing that. That's not like a new thing this year, we constantly do that. I think that the biggest thing responsible for the lift is consumer demand. And then the consumer is really interested in tracking his or her credit score. Hi, Brett. Yes. To the extent we are willing to share that information, it's less to do with the type of scores and it's more to do with the size of the customer. So we are into a more kind of a tiered pricing philosophy. And so I would say that the price increases were spread across the spread -- scores portfolio with a view to the size of the customer buying the scores. Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And I would say they are still getting a good deal, but not as good a deal. What's interesting is, historically, we have provided for lack of a better term point solutions for our bank customers, originations and customer management and fraud and collections and recovery as you know. What we are seeing -- what we saw last year and what we are starting to see more of is more engagement with the IT department, more engaged with the CIO, and a better understanding on the part of our customers have just the benefits and value of the platform. So while they may still be buying a solution like originations, now they appreciate that it's originations on top of the platform. And there is all kinds of potential that goes with that where for small incremental investments they get large incremental value out. I think that's the biggest change we are seeing in the conversation is customers increasingly understanding our strategy around platform and looking to leverage it. Yes. So I guess the honest answer is our work is never done. Okay. So it's not like we will just say, okay. Now it's on the platform, we can all go home. It's a process. And so we have moved some core fraud applications from Falcon onto the platform. Our compliance is now available in Falcon X on the platform. We are also looking at, I would say, more flexible and modular approaches to providing fraud solutions on the platform. So there will be some of that. Some of our applications aren't going to make it to the platform. So, for example, collections and recovery has a massive code base, 8 million lines of code. And it just doesn't make sense to rewrite it onto the platform. And so that will remain a distinct code base. So, when are we done? I guess another way to think of it is, when are we going to feel that the platform is sufficiently mature that customers who want to have multiple use cases on the platform have that work? I think we are almost there. Now, we are pretty much there. This Latin American bank deal that we just referenced, it started out with a conversation about a handful of use cases that they would want to do on the platform and they we are up to 19. And I think there's more in the future. So it's a different way of thinking about the value that we provide. Hi, Jake. Like last quarter, Experian -- Equifax and TransUnion reported before us last week and end of the prior week, and you can see how they broke out mortgage volumes. We don't break out mortgage volumes, but we can say that what we saw was consistent with what they told The Street they saw. I think one showed up 45% in terms of volume and the other was closer to 60%, although it's a little unclear whether that was for the quarter itself or sort of run rate including the last -- including the month of October, but our volumes were consistent with what you could see from them. No. It's independent. It's not related to that. What is related to is we had some deals that are really long-term deals long, much longer than typical than has been our usual. And I would say that that trend could continue. We will have to see how things play out. But I think when banks adopt our platform and standardize on the platform, it's not surprising that they would want to lock us in for a long period of time with an understanding of what it's going to cost. So I think there's going to be pressure for longer-term deals on us. Yes. We try to be smart about it and yes it's definitely client request. So part of the strategy of the platform is to is to have a lot of interoperability around the data, right? So we have a data orchestration layer. We can take data from lots of different places and bring it into the platform. And then we have a wide range of analytics that can be applied to that data. And then we have various solutions that sit on top of that platform, of that decision platform to meet specific needs. Our strategy with the platform has been to -- as we migrate our applications to the platform, the way we think about it is we say, what are the components of this solution that we ought to modularize, what are the micro services that are involved here and let's break them up and make them available to users of the platform, so they can be mixed and matched in different ways. And so that's really kind of the heavy lifting that's going on. We have also put a lot of energy into a thing called FICO Studio, which is kind of a front end fourth generation language kind of a programming environment where you can drag and drop a lot of things to build workflows based on the decisioning analytics in the platform. So there's a lot of work that's gone into that. But the way we think about it is not let's port an application to the platform. It's more break up the application into its component parts, understand how they can be micro services that could be consumed in independently and then bring those to the platform so they can be reassembled on the platform for all different kinds of purposes. I am not sure that we will have a change in the rate and pace of adoption of new scores under -- based on the administration. I do think that all lenders are really focused right now on how do they get the most value out of scoring algorithms and they are increasingly using things like FICO resiliency index to complement the traditional FICO score to make these decisions. I wouldn't say that's driven by the administration. I think that's more driven by the innovation coming out of our scores team. But there's a tremendous appetite on the side of the banks to get the full benefit out of it. And so, we are pretty focused on that. I think that we definitely... I think we have definitely enjoyed a spike because of the environment. There's no question that consumers are more focused than ever on their score and whether it's going up or down, I get letters in the mail all the time. And that's definitely the environment driving that. So I would say the 62% spike I referenced earlier that is -- that's driven by the environment. In terms of the lifetime value, how long they stay on. We have not -- it's too early to tell, but we haven't seen changes. So what we are seeing so far is kind of the same attrition over time that we have historically had. So we will stay. What we have noticed is that there's an inexorable trend to consumers being ever more focused on their credit score. I mean, this has been every year, year in, year out has become bigger and more important to them. And so, I am not sure that it's like a spike up and then a ramp down. I mean, it may just be part of a trend."

Afterwards, we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 29, 2020. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.\nSteven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call. I\u2019m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations. And I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through July 29, 2021. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. We continue to work primarily from home. Most of our offices are remaining closed. I\u2019m pleased to say this model has worked very well for us. Our productivity metrics remain very strong. And we\u2019re able to innovate, meet development deadlines, serve our customers and implement our solutions. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I\u2019ll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I\u2019ll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the markets that we serve. I am pleased to report that we had another very strong quarter, which demonstrates the remarkable resiliency of our business. As shown on Slide 2, we reported revenues of $314 million, flat with the same period last year, which was our highest revenue quarter ever. We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. We delivered $77 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.58. We also delivered $99 million of free cash flow in the quarter, the highest single quarter in company history. As you can see, on Slide 3, we continue to have ample liquidity. We actually reduced our total debt by about $20 million from the end of our second quarter. We generated $106 million in new bookings and have a very strong pipeline of deals as we move into the fourth quarter. Our software revenue was down 8% this quarter due to the difficult comparison to last year, when we have large application renewal revenue. This quarter, the application segment was down 15%, primarily due to lower upfront license revenues. Decision Management Software was up 22%, primarily due to increases in recurring transactional revenues. In the Scores business, we had another record quarter, despite the volatility in the credit markets. Total revenues were up 14% versus the prior year and totaled $132 million. B2C revenues were up 21% this quarter with strong growth in both myFICO and indirect partner channels. On the B2B side, revenues were up 12% over the same period as last year. This is especially encouraging as this is an area that can be highly volatile in uncertain economic times. We saw strength in the mortgage markets throughout the quarter with volumes up due to low interest rates. In auto, volumes are down significantly at the start of the quarter and improved over the balance of the quarter. For cards and other unsecured lending, marketing and originations volumes were down throughout the quarter, as financial institutions slowed new card acquisition efforts. Obviously, there\u2019s still a great deal of volatility in these markets with record unemployment and furloughs. We also continue to innovate in Scores. Last month, we introduced the FICO Resilience Index, an analytic tool that complements the FIFO score and helps lenders, borrowers and investors to identify the financial resiliency of consumers across FIFO Score bands to make more informed and precise decisions in assessing risk during rapidly changing economic cycles. In general, in a down economy, access to credit goes down as lenders try to mitigate the credit risk. The FICO Resilience Index can be helpful in navigating through changing economic cycles. The desired outcome is a system that is even more precise in assessing and pricing risk and less prone to broad credit restrictions and risk pricing, which can tighten the flow of credit during an economic downturn. As we navigate through the current economic climate, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the performance of our business. Last quarter, we retracted our full-year guidance due to widespread economic uncertainty. We now have additional data points, but markets have yet to stabilize. So while we won\u2019t give formal guidance, we are offering additional visibility into how various metrics are trending as we finish our fiscal year. If you look at Slide 4, an updated version of what we showed last quarter, you\u2019ll see how we performed in Q3 and where we stand year to date versus our original guidance. We\u2019re trending well in Scores with both B2B and B2C ahead of our original guidance. On the Software side, we\u2019re slightly behind in transactional and maintenance volumes as reduced economic activity has slowed volumes. We also have risk in license sales and services revenue. Our fourth quarter tends to be the highest sales quarter for us. And we have a strong pipeline of deals. We see clients accelerating their digital transformation plans where we play a central role. But again, with the uncertain economic environment, it\u2019s difficult to commit to specific revenue numbers. On the expense side, we\u2019re spending well below what was embedded in our guidance. As a result, we will likely have some savings versus what we expected at the beginning of the year. While there are still many moving pieces, we now believe it\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll be able to hit our previously guided pre-tax income and net income numbers, In many ways this is the most difficult health and economic environment we\u2019ve ever faced. At the same time, we have a very resilient business model, and we\u2019re actively managing the business to work through the near-term difficulties with an eye toward our long-term strategy. I\u2019ll share some summary thoughts later. But now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMichael McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $314 million flat with the prior year, and up 2% from the prior quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $920 million, up 8% from the prior year. Our Applications segment revenues were $141 million, down 15% versus the same period last year. This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue. As you may recall, we had a very large license component in Q3 last year due to renewals, which under ASC 606 accounting standards require upfront revenue recognition even though we build a customer as an annual subscription. Software applications billings for the quarter were $61 million flat versus last year, and up 27% from our second quarter, where we had significant COVID-related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $41 million, up 22% over the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to SaaS subscription revenues in our decision management platform. DMS bookings were $29 million in Q3, down 22% from the previous year, but up 25% from the last quarter. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $132 million, up 14% from the same period last year. B2B was up 12% over the same period, and B2C revenues were up 21% from Q3 2019. In our third fiscal quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 79% of total revenues in the quarter. Consulting and implementation revenue were 14% of total revenues and license revenues were 7%. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS were $77 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year that included $61 million of transactional software revenue and $16 million in professional services. Bookings for the quarter totaled $106 million, down 3% from last year, but up 26% from last quarter. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. SaaS bookings were $40 million for the quarter, down 12% from the previous year, but up 31% from last quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $231 million this quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter. This is due primarily to decreases in travel, marketing and other discretionary expenses. We expect Q4 expenses to be moderately higher. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 34% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $64 million flat with the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $77 million for the quarter, which was up 1% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 16%, which included $5 million of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 9% to 11% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, our recurring tax rate before these excess tax benefits is approximately 25% to 26% globally. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million compared to $61 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63%. Free cash flow this quarter benefited from a large reduction in the working capital year-over-year, primarily related to unusually high accounts receivables at the end of Q3 2019. Free cash flow for the trailing 4 quarters was $297 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had $126 million in cash, which is up $19 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by share repurchases. Our total debt face value is $938 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn $103 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We further drew on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes in July. Our leverage ratio as calculated for revolving line of credit was 2.16, and our covenant as you may recall is 3.25 on the revolver. We bought back 157,000 shares in the third quarter for $54 million at an average price of $343 per share. And today, we announced the new board authorization for $250 million of share repurchase. Finally, as Will said, because of the current uncertain economic environment, we are not providing formal financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2020. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.\nWilliam Lansing: As we work to finish our fiscal year and build plans for fiscal 2021, I\u2019m confident that FICO is well positioned for the future. We\u2019re built to withstand economic downturns and are taking steps to manage through current uncertainties without sacrificing our commitment to our strategic initiatives. As I\u2019ve said before, we are stewards of remarkable assets. And we have a great team dedicated to helping our customers solve their most difficult problems. And the value of the analytic solutions we provide both in software and in Scores is more important now than ever. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve to manage the Q&A.\nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will. We will now take your questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. My first question is just on the B2B Scores business. I think the 10% growth felt a little bit light to us. So I was just hoping you could walk us through what that mix between price and volume was there, maybe versus the last quarter, even actually like you then missing the pricing element or the mix of your different lending categories in there.\nWilliam Lansing: Yeah. Manav, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve ever broken out the mix between the volume and the price. The volume was a little bit lighter, as you\u2019d expect over a quarter like this one, so some of that was price.\nMichael McLaughlin: And, Manav, I\u2019ll just speak to \u2013 maybe give you a little more directional view on that. Look, we happen to report earnings after Equifax and TransUnion, also after Visa. And you can see some of the trends that would underlie our results in the B2B Scores business, particularly on the origination side from what they\u2019re showing. Obviously, mortgage volumes were very, very strong. Auto volumes seem to be picking up, but for the quarter we\u2019re down. And on the personal loan and credit card side of things, we\u2019re seeing the same things that the bureaus saw in the period. Now, that bureau data also seems to suggest that the trend is improving, but there is certainly no assurance that that\u2019s going to maintain itself. And, of course, when you look at the pricing across the 3 segments, I think you understand well the strategic pricing actions we took in the, what is our other category, credit cards, personal loans, and so forth. And that category suffered the worst in terms of volumes, but the pricing actions helped mitigate that.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just in the B2C side, I mean, that\u2019s a pretty impressive number, is there any onetime deal activity in there, like you signed some new clients or so forth?\nMichael McLaughlin: No, that\u2019s a pretty clean number. We are genuinely seeing consumer interest in their credit score and how they can track it and improve it in this environment. And it\u2019s showing both directly in myFICO.com and in our partner B2C sales.\nManav Patnaik: Got it? And then, maybe just one last question. Will, in your conversations with clients on the Software and even on the Scores side, are you starting to hear any kind of major budget issues where maybe you could see more delays on the Software side and maybe more pressure on the pricing side?\nWilliam Lansing: No, we really haven\u2019t had that. I think things are moving a little bit more slowly than they have historically. I think there is this kind of additional care being taken with everything that our customers do. That said, they are full steam ahead on digital transformation, on upgrading their solutions. And we\u2019re front and center there. So we really haven\u2019t experienced slowness there.\nManav Patnaik: All right, thanks a lot.\nOperator: We have a question from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBill Warmington: Good evening, everyone.\nWilliam Lansing: Hi, Bill.\nMichael McLaughlin: Hey, Bill.\nBill Warmington: So, Equifax \u2013 hey, guys. So Equifax and TransUnion both indicated improving results in June and July. And I know you guys are typically lagging those results by maybe 45 days. And so I wanted to see whether those improvements that they\u2019re describing are showing up in your results. Did you see them in the June results? Are you seeing them in July?\nWilliam Lansing: We so \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely right that our stuff lags them by roughly 6 weeks. We get some early indication and on basis of that, I\u2019m pretty comfortable saying that our stuff will track theirs. But, again, it\u2019s not final. These numbers aren\u2019t final.\nBill Warmington: Got it. Also on the B2C, to follow up on Manav\u2019s comments, that looks like a very strong quarter. TransUnion noted though, since they are a big supplier in the indirect space that they were a little concerned about the second half of the year, just because they were concerned that the aggregators are not seeing a lot of demand from the banks, meaning the banks are not very aggressive these days at trying to add new accounts. And so, I just wanted to touch-base on whether you felt comfortable with those volumes \u2013 with that level of growth continuing, because you can see the inside much better than we can, so.\nWilliam Lansing: Look, we\u2019re pleased with the growth that we had and it\u2019s always hard to forecast the future in an environment like this. The one thing that\u2019s clear though is consumers are more focused, more interested in what\u2019s going on with their credit score than they\u2019ve ever been before. And we\u2019re seeing it in myFICO. We\u2019re seeing it in our partner consumer stuff. And so, I would hope that trend would continue. But again, we don\u2019t know.\nBill Warmington: Yeah. How\u2019s been the demand for UltraFICO and Experian Boost, how\u2019s that been?\nWilliam Lansing: So Experian Boost is doing very well. And as you know, that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s boosting a FICO score and so there\u2019s a benefit to FICO every time Boost happens. UltraFICO is lagging now, and largely because of the success that we\u2019re having with Boost.\nBill Warmington: Got it? And I wanted to ask on the software side, you guys have been making some outsized investments in software now for some time. And I want to check in just to see whether you felt like the time was approaching when the rate of investment in software was going to start to slow.\nWilliam Lansing: I can\u2019t make that promise, Bill. What I would tell you is that \u2013 what we\u2019re seeing is tremendous appetite for our new solutions and our new Decision Management Platform, and deal size is getting bigger. And we now have banks that are adopting our solution, our Decision Management Platform solution, and then building all kinds of use cases on top of it. So we feel like we\u2019re being vindicated in the strategic direction. At the same time, we \u2013 it does require investment. We continue to pour investment in. When will margins improve? There\u2019ll be some margin improvement over time as we scale up our SaaS business and have more multi-tenant and returns to scale. So there\u2019ll be some benefits there. And I think, professional services \u2013 as our products become simpler to install and a little bit easier, the proportion of professional services will go down, which will also be a margin improvement. So those are the factors but I can\u2019t give you a timeline. I would tell you that we will continue to invest at this rate as long as it feels like those are smart decisions, like those are intelligent decisions given the appetite of the market for our staff.\nBill Warmington: You mentioned the banks adopting some of the DMS solutions and then building their own solutions on top of that. I know from time-to-time, you\u2019ve talked about how you\u2019ve developed your own \u2013 some of the new generations of your products are actually being built on the DMS platform and you use a lot of tools internally to do that. There was some talk about sometime over maybe the next 18 to 24 months, taking those tools and turning them outward, meaning that you\u2019d have this whole ecosystem similar to salesforce.com or Workday, and having developers being able to develop customized tools on that platform. Does that \u2013 is that timeline still\u2026\nWilliam Lansing: Yeah. That\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re very focused on that. And this year, 2021, this coming year will be the year when our APIs are available on an outward basis, and borrowers and resellers and others will be able to build solutions on top of our platform, so that\u2019s very much part of our strategy. It\u2019s the way that we intend to reach other verticals besides financial services. It\u2019s a way for us to go down market and basically solve the problem that we\u2019ve always had, which is very limited distribution for extraordinary IP.\nBill Warmington: Yeah. Excellent. All right. I\u2019ll yield the floor. Thank you very much for the insight.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Bill.\nOperator: We have a question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yeah. Thanks. Sorry, if this is introductory, but I wasn\u2019t aware of kind of Bill\u2019s line of questioning about the 45-day lag. So I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding it correctly. So are you saying that you have not yet been paid for the credit pulls at the bureaus in June, because it\u2019s not only that it\u2019s reported to you like in arrears at the end of the month, but you\u2019re actually paid kind of on a lagged basis and you recognize revenue on a lagged basis?\nWilliam Lansing: Mike, do you want to answer that?\nMichael McLaughlin: Yeah. No, we don\u2019t recognize revenue on a lag basis. We don\u2019t get the final report for June until some period, days, not weeks, after the end of the quarter. But we take an accrual based for an estimated revenue that in conversations with those customers we determined is appropriate for the quarter. And historically, it\u2019s very close and for revenue recognition purposes, it means that we\u2019re able to batch revenue in the quarter with revenue recognized. Cash flow wise and billing wise, we have \u2013 we\u2019re not going to go into our payment terms with individual customers on a call like this. But our payment terms with the bureaus are normal course and speed for a relationship like we have with them. But we do get those reports, so we \u2013 in arrears, as mentioned before. So we don\u2019t know, we genuinely don\u2019t know, what is happening in July at our bureau partners. We\u2019ll know in a couple of weeks. Does that help?\nJeffrey Meuler: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Yes, it does. And then just the expenses in the Scores business. What\u2019s driving that, and I guess, was curious, if you\u2019re leaning in more on marketing spend for myFICO, or if there\u2019s a mix shift going on where you have some more expenses to the bureaus for like tri-merge premium, myFICO products or something?\nMichael McLaughlin: So much of it is that we\u2019re investing in the FICO Resilience Index. As Will mentioned briefly in his remarks, and maybe he wants to talk more about that. We haven\u2019t dramatically increased marketing for the other parts of our business, but the development work, the outreach work and the implementation work around the Resilience Index, as well as other innovation steps that we\u2019re taking in the Scores businesses, primarily what\u2019s driving the increase you see there.\nWilliam Lansing: And then one small factor is that with myFICO as the volumes go up, our expense goes up, because we have a cost of goods sold in myFICO.\nJeffrey Meuler: Right, right. Got it. So I know that net revenue retention isn\u2019t a common metric that you give. But just curious, if you can help us understand or size up the land and expand on the DMS platform solution? Like are there enough historical examples or time series where you can help us kind of understand? How big does the customer tend to come on as a new engagement for a DMS platform? And then, I don\u2019t know, 2 or 3 years down the road, just how much more additional product or revenue are you generating off of them?\nWilliam Lansing: So what we\u2019re \u2013 I mean, I would say it\u2019s early days. And so it\u2019s we don\u2019t have a lot of data points around which to build a conclusion. That said, it looks really good. So what you have the situation where the very biggest banks, our biggest customers, absolute top tier banks, they have super complicated systems and they still buy some point solutions, and we have not yet had a top 10 bank stay to us, yeah, we\u2019re adopting the FICO Decision Management Platform for all of our consumer facing decisioning. That hasn\u2019t happened yet. However, it is happening with a tier down. And so, I would say, 2 years ago, we had some small banks that were doing it, and said, yeah, we\u2019re going to standardize myFICO decisioning platform. And then we\u2019re going to build all kinds of different credit decisions around that. And now we\u2019re moving up market and so we have some pretty good-sized banks that have made the decision to adopt it. And sometimes it\u2019s \u2013 they\u2019ll start with a point solution they were in the market for and recognize the expansion opportunity. And sometimes, they do it very deliberately, with a view to putting a whole lot of different use cases on top of the platform once it\u2019s been adopted. So the dog is eating the food, we\u2019re pretty happy about the way it\u2019s gone.\nJeffrey Meuler: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson: Hey, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to start on the decision management piece of the business. It seems like you\u2019ve had some nice growth there for several of the last few quarters. Is the SaaS momentum kind of rolling strong enough where we can expect this growth to be able to continue? Or were there any like large chunky deals in there that we need to be mindful of? I just want to make sure we\u2019re thinking about that piece of the business.\nWilliam Lansing: I think that is fair to think that the growth will continue. I mean, this is \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 obviously, the number is a little bit volatile, because it\u2019s a smaller part of our business still. And so on a percentage basis, it can move quickly, because we\u2019re dealing with smaller numbers. That said, there is \u2013 we have evermore solutions on top of the platform, it\u2019s very much our future. It\u2019s the way our salespeople are selling. It is the way the banks are buying it. And it is a very different world than it was 3 or 4 years ago. So while we still have sales of legacy product, and our legacy solutions will be around for a long time to come, because they\u2019re best-in-class at what they do. The Decision Management Platform is really picking up steam.\nMichael McLaughlin: And let me just add a little technical nuance for that. It\u2019s a good question, because under the ASC 606 accounting rules. It can create some distortions in revenue when you sell an on-prem subscription product for 3, 5 years. That on-prem portion, in most cases, needs to be recognized all at once upfront, despite the fact that it\u2019s a subscription. But if it\u2019s a SaaS sale, it is recognized ratably as we bill and deliver it. So it can be lumpy for that reason alone, and not reflecting the underlying health of the business. Look, if there are big whoppers like that, that we\u2019ve had to pull forward in any particular quarter, we\u2019ll do our best to call those out. This quarter, it was a normal mix between the types of revenue recognition and sort of the growth is pretty normal.\nKyle Peterson: Great. That\u2019s really good color. And then just a follow-up on the margins. Nice to see the upside there this quarter. And I mean, can appreciate the color you guys have provided in the slide deck on get some of the travel, entertainment and those types of expenses, which are obviously a bit lower right now. I just want to see have you guys \u2013 when \u2013 as we\u2019ve gone through this kind of COVID process. Have you guys found any other expenses that you might be able to rationalize that might lead do some longer-term cost savings for whenever the world gets a little more\u2026\nWilliam Lansing: Yeah. It\u2019s a good question. We wrestle with it ourselves. I am \u2013 we\u2019re of a view that some of these savings are here to stay. We don\u2019t imagine that we\u2019ll ever go back to the level of travel, we had before. I think that all of us not just like but our customers and our \u2013 everyone involved is now way more adept at using Zoom and doing more video. And what we\u2019re finding is, we can have comparable, if not more contact with our customers with less travel. And so \u2013 and it\u2019s obviously more efficient and a much lower cost. So I would imagine some of it\u2019s going to survive in a post-COVID world. That said, it is unnaturally low right now. So you can expect it to go up from the level it\u2019s at now, you can expect it to be lower than it was a year ago on an ongoing basis.\nKyle Peterson: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions, and nice quarter, guys.\nOperator: We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nBrett Huff: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick question on the helpful chart that you guys put, I think it was Slide 3 or 4, where you had some red boxes and green boxes. Just want to make sure I understand the red boxes and that there\u2019s some risk to those numbers. But it seems that the Scores boxes \u2013 the Scores number is 63 and 18, those seems like hittable targets and wondering, are those not green boxed, because they\u2019re a little harder to predict? Or kind of what should we imply, given that it seems those might fall in the green box category?\nWilliam Lansing: I\u2019d say it\u2019s a little hard to predict. It\u2019s a \u2013 call it, conservatism on our part, it\u2019s a little harder to predict.\nBrett Huff: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then a quick update on the progress that you guys are making, which I know, it varies a little bit by product on the SaaS-ification of the products. I know you\u2019ve got some already SaaS-ified, originations manager and et cetera. I know the Falcon and the update to TRIAD is coming out and/or near live. Can you just remind us of where we are in each of those products kind of coming out with the full GA SaaS product?\nWilliam Lansing: We\u2019re more than halfway through the process if you look at our top franchises. So as you mentioned, originations manager is now on the platform, the new version of TRIAD, which we call Strategy Director is now on the platform. Blaze, our rules engine, is now on the platform called Decision Modeler. So we\u2019re making progress there. There\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d say, the 2 biggest ones that aren\u2019t there yet are Falcon and debt manager. And those will be \u2013 those will take longer. I mean, Falcon, we\u2019re working on it, we have another release coming very soon. But that\u2019s a massive undertaking.\nBrett Huff: And then last question is, the license revenue from Falcon was down quite a bit. I know some of that was from \u2013 I think it was down 66%. I think some of that was from the difficult comp. Is there any color you can give us that might be help us to kind of see the COVID impact rather than the tough comp impact? I\u2019m not sure if you told us kind of what the numbers were on a year over year basis, if I go back to that script.\nWilliam Lansing: We don\u2019t break out the volume part of it, but the volumes are down somewhat, a bit. But that\u2019s part of it.\nBrett Huff: Okay.\nMichael McLaughlin: Yeah, and the vast majority of it was the renewal comp. We just had a couple of whoppers in the third quarter of last year, that all had to be recognized up front and those only happen once in a while and certainly not this quarter.\nBrett Huff: Okay, great. That\u2019s what I needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Actually, a question about the Scores business, and just kind of following up on the earlier question about the volumes, generally, I mean, industry volumes that are kind of widely reported, whether it\u2019s mortgage, auto or credit, they\u2019ve generally been fairly good predictors of the Scores revenues. But based on kind of what I was calling incredible results that you guys, really good results that you guys posted this quarter, from my perspective, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in some of the segments. And so, when I looked at like the mortgage volumes for industry, that was fairly consistent with what the bureaus reported, but then they reported auto and credit data that was much stronger than what the industry data would suggest. And do you have any color in terms of other types of activity that could have made up for that delta or any color there might be helpful? I mean, as an example, if I was to look at some of the bank data, their marketing activities, their credit card originations\u2026\nWilliam Lansing: Yeah, I would say that that, I mean, in general, I don\u2019t really have an answer for you. A narrow thing would be the fact that we do less lead gen than some of the bureaus, so you\u2019ll see less there.\nSurinder Thind: Okay, thank you. And then, another follow-up question, in terms of just the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Force put up some recommendations a couple of weeks ago related to credit scoring. And one of the recommendations was that the credit scores being more inclusive of using alternative data which would suggest support for your newer scores, so FICO 9, FICO 10. And is there any potential revenue benefits from you guys, that you guys would experience if clients were to upgrade to, let\u2019s say, the newest versions of the scores? Or are you somewhat agnostic as long as the clients continue to use FICO Scores.\nWilliam Lansing: I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of the latter. We\u2019re agnostic. And we encourage people to move up to the latest and greatest scores, not because we charge more for them, but because we think they\u2019ll get better results. And so, no, I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s \u2013 don\u2019t expect a revenue uptick as they migrate to newer scores, no.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s helpful. And then one other question in terms of \u2013 are you able to provide any color in terms of the percentage or revenue that maybe that\u2019s in scores, that\u2019s maybe less volume driven, that might be more relationship driven, such as like monitoring type of revenues or any color around ballpark figures that you might be able to provide?\nWilliam Lansing: I\u2019m not sure I follow the question. I mean, all of our Scores revenue is driven at some level by volume and a little bit by price.\nSurinder Thind: I guess what I was trying to get at was if we were to use just credit cards as an example, obviously, there is the origination volumes, there\u2019s the marketing volume, but then there\u2019s the monitoring piece. And so, I\u2019m assuming monitoring would be more based on like the headcount that a certain bank would have. And so that would be less subject to, I guess, the COVID environment in the sense that they would want to continue to monitor all of their accounts.\nWilliam Lansing: Yeah, we see continued interest from our bank customers and monitoring closely. I mean, if anything, they\u2019re more vigilant and more focused than ever.\nSurinder Thind: Okay.\nMichael McLaughlin: But maybe \u2013 to give you more, practically, those account management volumes, which is what we call them, are also based on the number of scores pulled. So there\u2019s no real difference in the volume driver there for account management versus originations.\nSurinder Thind: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nWilliam Lansing: Thank you. This ends today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\nOperator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation. I ask you to please disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the quarter was $314 million flat with the prior year, and up 2% from the prior quarter. Year-to-date, revenue was $920 million, up 8% from the prior year. Our Applications segment revenues were $141 million, down 15% versus the same period last year. This decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue. As you may recall, we had a very large license component in Q3 last year due to renewals, which under ASC 606 accounting standards require upfront revenue recognition even though we build a customer as an annual subscription. Software applications billings for the quarter were $61 million flat versus last year, and up 27% from our second quarter, where we had significant COVID-related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q3 revenues were $41 million, up 22% over the same period last year. The increase was primarily due to SaaS subscription revenues in our decision management platform. DMS bookings were $29 million in Q3, down 22% from the previous year, but up 25% from the last quarter. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $132 million, up 14% from the same period last year. B2B was up 12% over the same period, and B2C revenues were up 21% from Q3 2019. In our third fiscal quarter, 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 79% of total revenues in the quarter. Consulting and implementation revenue were 14% of total revenues and license revenues were 7%. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS were $77 million for the quarter, an increase of 11% over the prior year that included $61 million of transactional software revenue and $16 million in professional services. Bookings for the quarter totaled $106 million, down 3% from last year, but up 26% from last quarter. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenues, a 15% yield. SaaS bookings were $40 million for the quarter, down 12% from the previous year, but up 31% from last quarter. Our operating expenses totaled $231 million this quarter, down $1 million from the prior quarter. This is due primarily to decreases in travel, marketing and other discretionary expenses. We expect Q4 expenses to be moderately higher. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 34% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $64 million flat with the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $77 million for the quarter, which was up 1% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 16%, which included $5 million of excess tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 9% to 11% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, our recurring tax rate before these excess tax benefits is approximately 25% to 26% globally. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million compared to $61 million in the same period last year, an increase of 63%. Free cash flow this quarter benefited from a large reduction in the working capital year-over-year, primarily related to unusually high accounts receivables at the end of Q3 2019. Free cash flow for the trailing 4 quarters was $297 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter, we had $126 million in cash, which is up $19 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by share repurchases. Our total debt face value is $938 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.38%. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn $103 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We further drew on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes in July. Our leverage ratio as calculated for revolving line of credit was 2.16, and our covenant as you may recall is 3.25 on the revolver. We bought back 157,000 shares in the third quarter for $54 million at an average price of $343 per share. And today, we announced the new board authorization for $250 million of share repurchase. Finally, as Will said, because of the current uncertain economic environment, we are not providing formal financial guidance for the remainder of fiscal 2020. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments. And, Manav, I'll just speak to \u2013 maybe give you a little more directional view on that. Look, we happen to report earnings after Equifax and TransUnion, also after Visa. And you can see some of the trends that would underlie our results in the B2B Scores business, particularly on the origination side from what they're showing. Obviously, mortgage volumes were very, very strong. Auto volumes seem to be picking up, but for the quarter we're down. And on the personal loan and credit card side of things, we're seeing the same things that the bureaus saw in the period. Now, that bureau data also seems to suggest that the trend is improving, but there is certainly no assurance that that's going to maintain itself. And, of course, when you look at the pricing across the 3 segments, I think you understand well the strategic pricing actions we took in the, what is our other category, credit cards, personal loans, and so forth. And that category suffered the worst in terms of volumes, but the pricing actions helped mitigate that. No, that's a pretty clean number. We are genuinely seeing consumer interest in their credit score and how they can track it and improve it in this environment. And it's showing both directly in myFICO.com and in our partner B2C sales. Hey, Bill. Yeah. No, we don't recognize revenue on a lag basis. We don't get the final report for June until some period, days, not weeks, after the end of the quarter. But we take an accrual based for an estimated revenue that in conversations with those customers we determined is appropriate for the quarter. And historically, it's very close and for revenue recognition purposes, it means that we're able to batch revenue in the quarter with revenue recognized. Cash flow wise and billing wise, we have \u2013 we're not going to go into our payment terms with individual customers on a call like this. But our payment terms with the bureaus are normal course and speed for a relationship like we have with them. But we do get those reports, so we \u2013 in arrears, as mentioned before. So we don't know, we genuinely don't know, what is happening in July at our bureau partners. We'll know in a couple of weeks. Does that help? So much of it is that we're investing in the FICO Resilience Index. As Will mentioned briefly in his remarks, and maybe he wants to talk more about that. We haven't dramatically increased marketing for the other parts of our business, but the development work, the outreach work and the implementation work around the Resilience Index, as well as other innovation steps that we're taking in the Scores businesses, primarily what's driving the increase you see there. And let me just add a little technical nuance for that. It's a good question, because under the ASC 606 accounting rules. It can create some distortions in revenue when you sell an on-prem subscription product for 3, 5 years. That on-prem portion, in most cases, needs to be recognized all at once upfront, despite the fact that it's a subscription. But if it's a SaaS sale, it is recognized ratably as we bill and deliver it. So it can be lumpy for that reason alone, and not reflecting the underlying health of the business. Look, if there are big whoppers like that, that we've had to pull forward in any particular quarter, we'll do our best to call those out. This quarter, it was a normal mix between the types of revenue recognition and sort of the growth is pretty normal. Yeah, and the vast majority of it was the renewal comp. We just had a couple of whoppers in the third quarter of last year, that all had to be recognized up front and those only happen once in a while and certainly not this quarter. But maybe \u2013 to give you more, practically, those account management volumes, which is what we call them, are also based on the number of scores pulled. So there's no real difference in the volume driver there for account management versus originations."

            "name": "William Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. We continue to work primarily from home. Most of our offices are remaining closed. I'm pleased to say this model has worked very well for us. Our productivity metrics remain very strong. And we're able to innovate, meet development deadlines, serve our customers and implement our solutions. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I'll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we're seeing in the markets that we serve. I am pleased to report that we had another very strong quarter, which demonstrates the remarkable resiliency of our business. As shown on Slide 2, we reported revenues of $314 million, flat with the same period last year, which was our highest revenue quarter ever. We delivered $64 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share. We delivered $77 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.58. We also delivered $99 million of free cash flow in the quarter, the highest single quarter in company history. As you can see, on Slide 3, we continue to have ample liquidity. We actually reduced our total debt by about $20 million from the end of our second quarter. We generated $106 million in new bookings and have a very strong pipeline of deals as we move into the fourth quarter. Our software revenue was down 8% this quarter due to the difficult comparison to last year, when we have large application renewal revenue. This quarter, the application segment was down 15%, primarily due to lower upfront license revenues. Decision Management Software was up 22%, primarily due to increases in recurring transactional revenues. In the Scores business, we had another record quarter, despite the volatility in the credit markets. Total revenues were up 14% versus the prior year and totaled $132 million. B2C revenues were up 21% this quarter with strong growth in both myFICO and indirect partner channels. On the B2B side, revenues were up 12% over the same period as last year. This is especially encouraging as this is an area that can be highly volatile in uncertain economic times. We saw strength in the mortgage markets throughout the quarter with volumes up due to low interest rates. In auto, volumes are down significantly at the start of the quarter and improved over the balance of the quarter. For cards and other unsecured lending, marketing and originations volumes were down throughout the quarter, as financial institutions slowed new card acquisition efforts. Obviously, there's still a great deal of volatility in these markets with record unemployment and furloughs. We also continue to innovate in Scores. Last month, we introduced the FICO Resilience Index, an analytic tool that complements the FIFO score and helps lenders, borrowers and investors to identify the financial resiliency of consumers across FIFO Score bands to make more informed and precise decisions in assessing risk during rapidly changing economic cycles. In general, in a down economy, access to credit goes down as lenders try to mitigate the credit risk. The FICO Resilience Index can be helpful in navigating through changing economic cycles. The desired outcome is a system that is even more precise in assessing and pricing risk and less prone to broad credit restrictions and risk pricing, which can tighten the flow of credit during an economic downturn. As we navigate through the current economic climate, I'm extremely pleased with the performance of our business. Last quarter, we retracted our full-year guidance due to widespread economic uncertainty. We now have additional data points, but markets have yet to stabilize. So while we won't give formal guidance, we are offering additional visibility into how various metrics are trending as we finish our fiscal year. If you look at Slide 4, an updated version of what we showed last quarter, you'll see how we performed in Q3 and where we stand year to date versus our original guidance. We're trending well in Scores with both B2B and B2C ahead of our original guidance. On the Software side, we're slightly behind in transactional and maintenance volumes as reduced economic activity has slowed volumes. We also have risk in license sales and services revenue. Our fourth quarter tends to be the highest sales quarter for us. And we have a strong pipeline of deals. We see clients accelerating their digital transformation plans where we play a central role. But again, with the uncertain economic environment, it's difficult to commit to specific revenue numbers. On the expense side, we're spending well below what was embedded in our guidance. As a result, we will likely have some savings versus what we expected at the beginning of the year. While there are still many moving pieces, we now believe it's likely that we'll be able to hit our previously guided pre-tax income and net income numbers, In many ways this is the most difficult health and economic environment we've ever faced. At the same time, we have a very resilient business model, and we're actively managing the business to work through the near-term difficulties with an eye toward our long-term strategy. I'll share some summary thoughts later. But now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. As we work to finish our fiscal year and build plans for fiscal 2021, I'm confident that FICO is well positioned for the future. We're built to withstand economic downturns and are taking steps to manage through current uncertainties without sacrificing our commitment to our strategic initiatives. As I've said before, we are stewards of remarkable assets. And we have a great team dedicated to helping our customers solve their most difficult problems. And the value of the analytic solutions we provide both in software and in Scores is more important now than ever. I'll turn the call back over to Steve to manage the Q&A. Yeah. Manav, I don't know that we've ever broken out the mix between the volume and the price. The volume was a little bit lighter, as you'd expect over a quarter like this one, so some of that was price. No, we really haven't had that. I think things are moving a little bit more slowly than they have historically. I think there is this kind of additional care being taken with everything that our customers do. That said, they are full steam ahead on digital transformation, on upgrading their solutions. And we're front and center there. So we really haven't experienced slowness there. Hi, Bill. We so \u2013 you're absolutely right that our stuff lags them by roughly 6 weeks. We get some early indication and on basis of that, I'm pretty comfortable saying that our stuff will track theirs. But, again, it's not final. These numbers aren't final. Look, we're pleased with the growth that we had and it's always hard to forecast the future in an environment like this. The one thing that's clear though is consumers are more focused, more interested in what's going on with their credit score than they've ever been before. And we're seeing it in myFICO. We're seeing it in our partner consumer stuff. And so, I would hope that trend would continue. But again, we don't know. So Experian Boost is doing very well. And as you know, that's \u2013 I mean, it's boosting a FICO score and so there's a benefit to FICO every time Boost happens. UltraFICO is lagging now, and largely because of the success that we're having with Boost. I can't make that promise, Bill. What I would tell you is that \u2013 what we're seeing is tremendous appetite for our new solutions and our new Decision Management Platform, and deal size is getting bigger. And we now have banks that are adopting our solution, our Decision Management Platform solution, and then building all kinds of use cases on top of it. So we feel like we're being vindicated in the strategic direction. At the same time, we \u2013 it does require investment. We continue to pour investment in. When will margins improve? There'll be some margin improvement over time as we scale up our SaaS business and have more multi-tenant and returns to scale. So there'll be some benefits there. And I think, professional services \u2013 as our products become simpler to install and a little bit easier, the proportion of professional services will go down, which will also be a margin improvement. So those are the factors but I can't give you a timeline. I would tell you that we will continue to invest at this rate as long as it feels like those are smart decisions, like those are intelligent decisions given the appetite of the market for our staff. Yeah. That's \u2013 we're very focused on that. And this year, 2021, this coming year will be the year when our APIs are available on an outward basis, and borrowers and resellers and others will be able to build solutions on top of our platform, so that's very much part of our strategy. It's the way that we intend to reach other verticals besides financial services. It's a way for us to go down market and basically solve the problem that we've always had, which is very limited distribution for extraordinary IP. Thanks, Bill. Mike, do you want to answer that? And then one small factor is that with myFICO as the volumes go up, our expense goes up, because we have a cost of goods sold in myFICO. So what we're \u2013 I mean, I would say it's early days. And so it's we don't have a lot of data points around which to build a conclusion. That said, it looks really good. So what you have the situation where the very biggest banks, our biggest customers, absolute top tier banks, they have super complicated systems and they still buy some point solutions, and we have not yet had a top 10 bank stay to us, yeah, we're adopting the FICO Decision Management Platform for all of our consumer facing decisioning. That hasn't happened yet. However, it is happening with a tier down. And so, I would say, 2 years ago, we had some small banks that were doing it, and said, yeah, we're going to standardize myFICO decisioning platform. And then we're going to build all kinds of different credit decisions around that. And now we're moving up market and so we have some pretty good-sized banks that have made the decision to adopt it. And sometimes it's \u2013 they'll start with a point solution they were in the market for and recognize the expansion opportunity. And sometimes, they do it very deliberately, with a view to putting a whole lot of different use cases on top of the platform once it's been adopted. So the dog is eating the food, we're pretty happy about the way it's gone. I think that is fair to think that the growth will continue. I mean, this is \u2013 it's \u2013 obviously, the number is a little bit volatile, because it's a smaller part of our business still. And so on a percentage basis, it can move quickly, because we're dealing with smaller numbers. That said, there is \u2013 we have evermore solutions on top of the platform, it's very much our future. It's the way our salespeople are selling. It is the way the banks are buying it. And it is a very different world than it was 3 or 4 years ago. So while we still have sales of legacy product, and our legacy solutions will be around for a long time to come, because they're best-in-class at what they do. The Decision Management Platform is really picking up steam. Yeah. It's a good question. We wrestle with it ourselves. I am \u2013 we're of a view that some of these savings are here to stay. We don't imagine that we'll ever go back to the level of travel, we had before. I think that all of us not just like but our customers and our \u2013 everyone involved is now way more adept at using Zoom and doing more video. And what we're finding is, we can have comparable, if not more contact with our customers with less travel. And so \u2013 and it's obviously more efficient and a much lower cost. So I would imagine some of it's going to survive in a post-COVID world. That said, it is unnaturally low right now. So you can expect it to go up from the level it's at now, you can expect it to be lower than it was a year ago on an ongoing basis. I'd say it's a little hard to predict. It's a \u2013 call it, conservatism on our part, it's a little harder to predict. We're more than halfway through the process if you look at our top franchises. So as you mentioned, originations manager is now on the platform, the new version of TRIAD, which we call Strategy Director is now on the platform. Blaze, our rules engine, is now on the platform called Decision Modeler. So we're making progress there. There's \u2013 I'd say, the 2 biggest ones that aren't there yet are Falcon and debt manager. And those will be \u2013 those will take longer. I mean, Falcon, we're working on it, we have another release coming very soon. But that's a massive undertaking. We don't break out the volume part of it, but the volumes are down somewhat, a bit. But that's part of it. Yeah, I would say that that, I mean, in general, I don't really have an answer for you. A narrow thing would be the fact that we do less lead gen than some of the bureaus, so you'll see less there. I'd say it's more of the latter. We're agnostic. And we encourage people to move up to the latest and greatest scores, not because we charge more for them, but because we think they'll get better results. And so, no, I wouldn't say that there's \u2013 don't expect a revenue uptick as they migrate to newer scores, no. I'm not sure I follow the question. I mean, all of our Scores revenue is driven at some level by volume and a little bit by price. Yeah, we see continued interest from our bank customers and monitoring closely. I mean, if anything, they're more vigilant and more focused than ever. Thank you. This ends today's call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon."

Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining FICO's Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements may involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 29, 2021. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. First, I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. As we all know, these are unprecedented time. No one can predict with any certainty the scale or length of disruption from COVID-19 or how severe the economic and health impacts will be. Many unknowns include the scope and effect of further public health responses as well as governmental, regulatory, fiscal and monetary policies. As we usually do, we've posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing a few of those today during our presentation. Today, I'll go over the results for our second fiscal quarter and first half of the year, then I'll talk about how we're viewing our business in light of the current situation and how we plan to execute on a plan to remain strong, while preparing for the opportunities when this crisis ends. As we show on Slide 2, we've been successful in moving to a work-from-home structure and have not skipped a beat in how we serve the needs of our customers. In fact, nearly all of our 4,000 person global workforce are currently working from home. We responded early, closing our China offices in February, and we followed the lead of local state and national authorities and 43 offices and 32 different countries. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees who've responded to the quickly unfolding circumstances and have allowed us to adjust to ensure that key internal and client side deliverables remain on track. We were well prepared to move to this model. Over the last year, we've increased our usage of video based communications. Before the pandemic, it was a valuable tool to drive collaboration or reduce travel is now critical business practice. Our technology team had already built a robust VPN infrastructure that permits remote access to secured networks and servers. That infrastructure and our cloud-based solutions and support has meant that we are able to serve our customers without any significant loss of productivity, and as always, our cyber security team has been focused on protecting customers environments and sensitive data. It hasn't been easy. They're uncertain stressful times for everyone. But I'm proud of the business continuity efforts we've undertaken to prepare for potential issues, whatever they may be and how those efforts have paid extraordinary dividends as we are able to adapt to the challenge as we face. Finally, we've established an internal coronavirus response team. These are all examples of resilient culture of dedicated professionals are stepping up to the daily challenges we face. So, I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong second fiscal quarter. We reported revenues of 308 million, an increase of 11% over the same period last year. We delivered 58 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.94 per share. We delivered 64 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.14. This fact that we began to experience COVID related this -- in spite of the fact that we've begun to experience the COVID-related disruption in late March, we were able to generate 84 million in new bookings, which is impressive considering the most of our deals are closed at the end of the quarter right when businesses were closing, and everyone was transitioning to work from home. We continue to have a strong pipeline and believe many of our solutions are exactly what our customers are looking for as they focus on risk management. Our software revenue was up minus 3%, this quarter, applications were down 1%. As we had fewer up front license sales and less services revenue than last year. Decision Management software was up 20% with increases in both license sales and transactional revenue some fields we've signed previous quarters. In this course business, we had another great quarter due to special pricing that began to take effect. Total revenues were up 24% versus the prior year and total of 129 million. On the B2B side, revenues were up 27 over the same period as last year. B2C revenues were up 15% this quarter. Scores, particularly B2B is also an area of risk during volatile economic times, as some of those revenues are tied to things like origination of new loans. The strength of our business and our conservative financial practices have allowed us to build a healthy balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 4, we have ample liquidity and borrowing capacity. But as we look ahead, it's impossible to fully understand what the possible impacts to our markets will be and predict when the economy will improve. Because of these uncertainties, we are retracting our full year guidance. I'd like to direct you to Slide 5 to remind everyone what our original guidance was, where we stand now halfway through the year, and what we would need to do in the back half to achieve those original numbers. In this version currency this slide provides more details of our guidance than what we previously disclosed including more granularity around revenues. The red highlight areas of potential higher risk in the coming months. With B2B Scores, as I said, it's difficult for us to accurately forecast what will happen with volumes in the near term. Because these Scores are sold through bureaus that report to us in arrears, we don't have visibility to real-time data. In times of disruption, this is especially difficult until we can begin to see the trends in the data. We anecdotally know that, mortgage volumes have been strong and auto has been weak, but it's difficult to quantify what's happening today level on the next several months. Now on the software side, we have a great deal of visibility into our transactional and maintenance revenue streams. I believe those revenues to be very resilient. It's more difficult to estimate how many deals we'll be able to close and what potential impacts that would have on license and service revenue. We know that, we have a strong pipeline of deals and fully expect to close many of them, but there's clearly more uncertainty than there was a few months ago. We also believe that, we'll spend less-than originally planned. We will likely see savings in some revenue-based expenses and we'll spend less on travel and marketing and other discretionary areas. We're scrutinizing our expenses more than ever and we're committed to being as efficient as possible. In short, we don't know the severity or duration of disruptions in credit markets or technology purchases. Declines in Scores volumes will have a negative impact on our revenues despite the special pricing that we start to see this quarter, but it's difficult to know, for instance, if declines in auto sales now create a backlog of buyers in the fall or if it is part of a longer downturn. And while sales cycles for our solutions will likely be longer, we don't yet know how much is due to customers reassessing purchases versus the logistical challenges of remote selling. That said, we remain confident in our business model. We've got a great start to the year. We have a large amount of recurring revenue. While we expect our software revenues in the second half of the year to be lower than our guidance due to COVID-19, we also expect expenses to decline to primarily to reduce sales marketing expense and employee travel. These expense reductions will mitigate the impact on our bottom-line and we expect to have other operating expense savings due to general disruptions. So even though top line volatility is difficult to predict, we could still meet our original bottom-line guidance with a number of factors play off. These are exceptionally volatile times, but we remain optimistic and are actively managing the business to breach the short-term difficulties while building long-term value. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. As usual, I'll start with some detail around the revenue for Q2 fiscal '20. FICO's revenue for the quarter was $308 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Our application segments revenue were $140 million, down 1% versus the same period last year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license and professional services revenue. Software applications bookings for the quarter were $48 million, down 24% from last year, due in large part to COVID-19 related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management software segments, Q2 revenues were $39 million, up 20% over the same trade last year. This increase was primarily due to license and SaaS subscription revenues from our Decision Management platform products. Decision Management software bookings were $23 million Q2, down 17% from the previous year, similarly due to software sales disruptions at the end of the quarter. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $129 million, up 24% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 27% over the same period last year and B2C revenues were up 15% from the same period. We do expect disruptions to Scores volumes, particularly on the B2B side as loan originations decline in some credit vertical. As Will said, Scores volumes are reported to us monthly in arrears, and so we did not have visibility into the Scores volumes real time. Turning to our global revenue mix. In our second fiscal quarter, 78% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 8% was from the Asia Pacific region. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represent 78% of total revenues in the quarter consulting and implementation revenues were 16% and licensed revenues were 6% of the total. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS products were 74 million for the quarter, which includes 58 million in transactional revenue and 17 million in professional services revenue. That's an increase of 12% from the previous year for our SaaS business. Total bookings, including our Scores segments for the quarter total a 4 million down 20% from last year, those bookings generated 12 million and current period revenues 14% yield. SaaS bookings were 31 million for the quarter, which was 6% from the previous year. Our operating expenses total 232 million in this quarter, down 14 million from the prior quarter due primarily to decreases in travel marketing and other discretionary expenses and the 3 million and restructuring costs in Q1 that did not recur in Q2. FICO's GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 25% and our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our schedule, there's 32%. GAAP net income this quarter was 58 million up 75% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was 64 million for the quarter of 36% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 7%, which included about 12 million of excess cash benefits, resulting from stock based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 10% to 12% for the full fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was 55 million compared to 44 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the trailing four quarters was $259 million. t Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of quarter, we had $109 million in cash it was down 2 million from last quarter, primarily driven by share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt face value is $959 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.44%, at the end of the quarter we had drawn 124 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We anticipate growing on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturities senior notes coming up in July. Our leverage ratio is calculated for our revolving line of credit was 2.25 times. As a reminder, our current covenant is 3.0 times and that covenant will expand to 3.25 when the most mature in July. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 290,000 shares in the second quarter for $96 million and an average price of $331 per share. At the end of March, we had about $64 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. Finally, as Will said because of the uncertainty around COVID-19 and the impacts on the economic environment, we are withdrawing our previously issued financial guidance. With that I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments.\nWill Lansing: Okay. Work from home challenges. I'd like to end our prepared remarks today with some positive news. We're conducting a series of live webinars that we're calling building resiliency, adapting to the challenges of today. These webinars, which are almost virtual cycle world, began last week and continue through May 28. The topics falls in six tracks adaptability, digital customer engagement, risk management, operational efficiency, building trust and protecting customers. I'd encourage you to check it out information's available on our website and there are a number of keynote sessions that I think will be of interest to our investors, including one I'll be doing jointly with Equifax's CEO, Mark Begor, on May 14th. Finally, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. These are challenging times, but I'm convinced we're up to the challenge. We can't control the external factors we face, but we can control how we respond and plan for the future. We're stewards of remarkable assets and we remain optimistic as we look to the future. We'll bridge this period of disruption as we have in the past and will emerge as place for growth. I'll be as transparent as possible as we work through this uncertainty and will provide guidance as soon as we have better understand the economics and commercial environment. So, I'll now turn it back to Steve for Q& A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks Will. We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: I was just curious, if you could talk to us about the volume trends that you saw in the quarter in the -- if I understand, you can't see what's happening beyond that, but maybe what that growth was in the quarter and maybe how it looks like in my choices prior to Mike?\nWill Lansing: You're talking about B2C, Manav?\nManav Patnaik: No, B2B.\nWill Lansing: B2B, Mike, I don't know if you have the details on that.\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. So, the big three buckets of volumes in that part of our business as you know are, the mortgage business, the auto business and then credit cards, personal loans that we call the other segment. Mortgages were up, as you would expect given some of the refi dynamics that have been in place for a number of months. And in the auto and other segments, the volume changes were, on a year-over-year basis were in the single-digit percentages, so not really anything to write all about there. With respect to the end of the quarter, the impact was close enough to the end of March, which is the last reports we have from our partners at the bureau. So, we did not see anything informative from those volumes at the end of March. Frankly what you heard from the bureaus in their quarterly reports over the last a week or number of days, have more real time information that we have on that front.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And maybe just on the B2C business as well, I mean, your mix of business that has changed over the years. Do you anticipate that to be countercyclical or how should we think about that?\nMike McLaughlin: So far, it's holding up nicely and with respect to myFICO for example, it's up. It's not surprising consumer is very focused on their credit if it's kind of a time.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. And then just last one if I can squeeze it in. You talked about in a strong visibility on your transaction on the incident side of the software. So, I was just curious if you could just give a little bit color on what you're seeing from the customers? I mean, has that decelerated? Is that being just pushed out much later like any talk?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. It is being pushed out. So remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 250 day sales cycle. So, we had a lot of stuff that was in process that was closer to the end and to the beginning of the process and so that's something that pushed the next quarter, some of it got close. But they haven't been hit in the way they were back in 2007, 2008. It says this is a different kind of a situation, as and so we haven't seen them pulling back on their investment plans, at least not so far. Now, it would, it probably would be naive to believe that everything will be business as usual, and I'm sure on the margin, there'll be some business that we were hoping for that won't happen. But, but we haven't seen tremendous changes in behavior other than the timeline for getting transactions done slowing down a little bit.\nOperator: The next question is from Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nBill Warmington: So, I wanted to ask, if you could talk a little bit about what the revenue exposure is in Scores for those three buckets, credit card, mortgage and auto, that would be for the and I think for the B2B side?\nWill Lansing: Bill, I think, as Mike mentioned a minute ago, I think broadly we can mortgage looks like it's going to be up, auto looks like it's going to be way down, credit cards and personal loans down, but I think you probably do better reading into the numbers that you see from the Bureau's then asking us to speculate because we don't have it.\nBill Warmington: How does, I appreciate that in terms of the volumes, but once we once we get a sense of the volumes, then we have to map it to the FICO B2B revenue, and I was asking for some help in terms of how big is credit card as a percentage of revenue these days. How big is mortgage, how big is auto, how does that break down across the Scores B2B universe?\nWill Lansing: Mike, do you have those percentages? I don't know if you have any handy?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes, Bill, we haven't shared those in the past. I don't think this is the forum to change that disclosure practice. But I guess I can say that it hasn't changed materially at least to the end of March to what we had in the past in the past four years.\nBill Warmington: I don't know if they're working or not, but they're out there. All right, well then when you guys are talking about, you've made some references to margins and how there's some natural reduction in expenses going along with revenue and T&E reduction freezing hiring and so on. Is a thought to try to preserve the margin that was implied in the original guidance, which looks like it was around 30% to 33% EBITDA, that's adjusted EBITDA level around 30% operating margin? Is that that the thought that to try to, if it is lower revenue to try and preserve that margin percentage or your thought is to try to actually raise that margin percentage to offset the decline and deliver the same level of EPS?\nWill Lansing: I think, Bill, you expect it will take every step is within our power to manage our expenses to maximize the margin. So, while we don't have complete control over the top line, we obviously have a little more control over the bottom line. And so I would hope that we could do better than preserving the rate. But again, if you look at the slide in our deck, we basically laid out what would happen have to be true for us to hit the prior guidance.\nBill Warmington: Correct. Okay. And then just one in the context of expenses, I wanted to ask about your plans for continued investment in the software business and how that's going. You had mentioned, when you gave the original guidance, you talked about some opportunities for increased efficiency within the software business. I want to see how that's all, how you're weighing all that now?\nWill Lansing: Well, as the impact COVID has been on our company, we were engaged in and continue to be engaged in a really extensive review of every activity that we have going on in the Company, and our goal is to really focus on things that are truly strategic and to de-emphasize things that are less strategic. And that initiative, that work proceed the pace that it has not been slowed at least by COVID. I think if anything, we're more committed than ever to getting as as much of our capability onto the platform as quickly as possible so we can start to see the returns to scale that we're all looking for. So, I would say that, our investments plans on a strategic and platform stuff completely unchanged. If anything, we're looking for ways to free up resources to put even more against it. But then things that are off-platform, off-strategy, we're scrutinizing those barriers.\nBill Warmington: Then last one from me, I wanted to ask about, the FICO Resilience Index. It sounds like an interesting product. It looks like you're -- maybe you could talk a little bit about what the plan is for that one in terms of the rollout. It looks like Equifax is the only one right now doing a test with it, but how soon do you think that's going to, before that actually starts to generate some revenue? How big could it be?\nWill Lansing: We think it's going to be very big. It's not going to generate any revenue in the near-term, because our plan is to provide it for free along with FICO Scores. So if you buy a FICO Score, you can also get the FICO Resiliency Index along with it. We think that, there is commensurate, maybe worth spending just a minute on what it is. This is some really smart stuff that our guys came up with. That helps us to differentiate amongst consumers and evaluate their credit within any particular FICO Score, that's at a point in time and at a point in the economic cycle. And there are individuals who are more resilient and they're individuals who are less resilient. And the traditional way of dealing with downturns and we see it today is that, lenders, raise their lending thresholds. They raised their cutoff, and while obviously that's a prudent thing to do, we'd love for that to be a little more sophisticated and surgical and be able to evaluate some of the individuals below those cutoffs and with more precision. And that's really what the FICO Resiliency Index does. It'll be bundled with the FICO Score. It will be widely available to anyone who's buying FICO Scores. It is currently in test, as you said with Equifax and the Dow. Experian will have it out too. TU should follow. And yes, we have high expectations because it's been very well received to-date.\nOperator: And we have question from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yes, thank you. Just within the software businesses. I understand that bookings are going to be impacted, which can impact revenue, license revenue, professional services. But in terms of client usage, I think there was a mention of collections and recovery. I'm guessing that's because of some collections hiatuses, but seeing some negative impacts there, but just what are you seeing across the different software businesses any kind of positives or negatives for the different products to call out?\nWill Lansing: We were seeing more in CCS and customer communication that's up a bit because the lenders are engaged in a lot more back and forth with their consumer customers than they have been in the past. So, that does a little the others, not tremendously different investment and we're not saying dudes proportional or anything.\nJeff Meuler: And then within the to be Scores, how much of it is tied to, I guess origination or marketing type volumes and how much of it is stickier or account management or open access programs have Scores in terms of B2B revenue mix?\nWill Lansing: We don't we don't break it out, we don't break it out. I think it's fair to assume that there'll be a little less origination activity. I mean, that's not unreasonable.\nJeff Meuler: Okay, and then there was two comments, as you were talking about the special pricing, one was began to take effect and then started to see just any sense of roughly how much of the special pricing was the benefit was felt this quarter versus yet to be further than?\nWill Lansing: We would have felt it. Yes, it's come in.\nOperator: We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nBrett Huff: Question to follow up on, what I thought was an interesting comment you made about on bank health. And well, I think you phrased it, the banks weren't hit, aren't hit yet as hard or aren't as hard as maybe the great recession just given this isn't bank led. A lot of our clients are trying to suss out kind of how banks are reacting. So, can you just flush out that a little bit more, I think you mentioned that you haven't seen any major changes in investments, but kind of what is their attitude as you talk to them about what their game plan is and how you can help them?\nWill Lansing: Well, I think that they're much better prepared than the last time their balance sheets are stronger. They have more capital on hand. They, learn the last time around, and I also think that the government and the fed has jumped in a way that very quickly in a way that they didn't the last time around to ponder and so I think it's those kinds of things. And as you can see from their public statements, if you really if you look at the public statements from the big bank CEOs, they're, they're obviously planning to weather this much better than the last time around.\nBrett Huff: That's helpful in any particular products that piqued my interest in the last six weeks. I'm assuming maybe collections or something like that, but anything that has kind of sparked spiked up given the changes in the in the outlook.\nWill Lansing: Since, as I mentioned earlier there's more usage of our customer communication services, which is the last mile to customer consumer, customer contacts, that those volumes are up. Remember loan sales cycle and so you wouldn't see things change quickly. The things that are in place, we're seeing more volume in places you'd expect like that, like they see CCS. But otherwise, we're not and then we're expecting with all the transaction volume down, credit card transaction volume down. It may have an impact on Falcon volumes. But, most of our Falcon business is priced by account. And so, I'm not sure how much impact it was really have on us.\nBrett Huff: Okay. Thank you for that. Last question from me is, one of the things that a lot of folks have been asking us is kind of all the value proposition that the FICO Score continues to provide, and even at higher prices, we're of the opinion that it's still one of the best deals going in risk management and portfolio management. Any conversations, I don't know how much you can talk about banks, but what is the, any added views on how does that value play out in uncertain situation like this for banks? Do they perceive it differently? Are they looking to buy differently, buy it more cetera for that risk management in a situation like this?\nWill Lansing: So, the answer is yes. We strongly believe that, it's a tremendous tool. FICO is tremendous tool for evaluating credit worthiness and more needed, more necessary, more in demand than ever in times like these. The Resiliency Index that I mentioned earlier is tied up in that. And so, the way we think about it, we are constantly innovating and trying to find ways to bring evermore sophistication to that evaluation to that decision and that's worked out pretty well. Will they be pulling account management support more frequently in these times, to be determined? We'll see. We'll see. It wouldn't be a shock.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon. Will, I'd like to start with a question on the discourse business. Can you talk a little bit about the strength in the B2C segment? There is a little bit of a color on it earlier, but a double-digit growth at this point seems really strong and how should we think about the consumer in this environment and then maybe even from a competitive perspective in the sense that, there are perhaps other competing services out there, that are also trying to at least mimic, providing consumers support type information for free.\nWill Lansing: Yes. I mean that's been going on for years. There are players out there who provide non-FICO Scores to consumers to help them, to give them a sense for what their credit worthiness. But since lenders predominantly use FICO Scores, there's a mismatch there. Consumers are sometimes confused, but we've been working for a long time. I'm trying to clear up that confusion and make sure that consumers understand that, a credit score is not a FICO Score unless it's a FICO score. And that, what they are trying -- what the consumer trying to understand is, what the lender thinks of them? What the lender's evaluation of their credit worthiness is than the FICO Scores a way to do it, we have arrangement with Experian, our partner where Experian provides FICO Scores to the consumers and their consumer offerings. We offer obviously FICO Scores in our own consumer offering in myFICO. We think that there's more appetite and interest in that than ever. Just kind of given the situation, people are concerned about their credit. And so, we feel pretty good about that business is tied to the origination of credit cards in the sense that there's a time there that'll slow that down.\nSurinder Thind: And then in terms of any color on -- is Experian the primary source of the B2C revenues or is myFICO a considerable percentage as well?\nWill Lansing: Experian is bigger than myFICO. It's a -- revenues experience -- no, myFICO is a good business too, a good-sized business, too. I don't think we break out the specifics of it, but experience is also very important to that business.\nSurinder Thind: And then in terms of just a big picture question for the Scores business, obviously, it is a very transaction driven business. Is there consideration to maybe moving more towards the licensing model just to reduce some of the volatility? Or is there an appetite from that from clients? Or is there any kind of discussions? Obviously, I think it was last quarter I believe that there was a big licensing deal, any colors or thoughts that you might be having with clients especially maybe in the current environment around something like this?\nWill Lansing: Most of our Scores businesses is price per Score.\nSurinder Thind: Understood, meaning that from your guidance perspective, from a strategy perspective, the desire for you guys to go more towards a licensing model?\nWill Lansing: Well, we're pretty happy with the model that we have. I don't know that we're looking to modify it.\nSurinder Thind: Understood, and then moving towards the software business. Can you talk a little bit about the applications business versus DMS, maybe the idea being that, how should we maybe think about the mix of sales on a go forward basis? Is the sales force being incentivized to maybe sell DMS over applications? Or I know in the past times you guys have talked about that you're agnostic, but obviously DMS is the platform of the future, right?\nWill Lansing: Right, we have historically paid a little bit extra attention to from a sales force perspective to selling DMS base products. But at the end of the day, we sell to our customers what they need, and with the DMS base, fantastic; and if it's not, then so be it, we'll do it that way. So -- and we compensate our sales people regardless of what it is they sell. I think your points well taken though, and as we think into the future, we likely will favor DMS sales over non-DMS sales. So, that I think that is a, that's a piece of business to really watch, that's the future.\nSurinder Thind: And then maybe turning to expenses, I mean, obviously, given the strength your cash flows, the balance sheet as a firm. I mean, do you really have to think about playing defense in the current environment? And I got the sense that you guys were obviously watching the expenses carefully. Obviously, that that's good to do at any point in time, but how should we just think about your overall expense allocation at this point or investment versus maybe what it would be under normalized conditions? How much of a difference are you guys kind of seeing? Obviously, there's a natural component to it, meaning obviously, the less travel is marketing type stuff, but just any color there would be helpful?\nWill Lansing: If you're asking about COVID, specific kind of implications that you just mentioned them, it's things like travel, and it's the fact that when revenues lower, we have less expenses associated with servicing that revenue. So, that part is for sure. I wouldn't say that, we're in a place where suddenly because of COVID our backs are to the wall and we have to rethink our entire expense structure. I think we're doing the thing that management always does, which is reviewing whether every dollar is well spent and we are engaged in that process and continue to be engaged in that process. But I wouldn't call it an emergency or a response to COVID. I think just running the business.\nSurinder Thind: Okay, understood. That was actually my point that, that you guys really do have a strong cash flow and balance sheet so you don't perhaps need to be as defensive as maybe other organizations are.\nWill Lansing: Absolutely.\nSurinder Thind: And then I guess turning to, I guess the question being in terms of just, when I look at the personal expenses, head counts up year-over-year but the personnel costs are down. Is that mostly like variable conflict that delta there? Or how should we be thinking about that difference?\nWill Lansing: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMike McLaughlin: It's two things, so as you may recall, we had a restructuring expense last quarter, a part of that was to reduce head count. And so, there's some of that. And then also we accrued throughout the year, yearend incentive bonuses, both cash and stock-based, based on certain expected outcome and that outcome exceeded or underperformed. And rate at which we accrue the yearend does have an impact on that period-to-period labor costs. The big picture though is that, head count is essentially flat. I think it's up 0.5% versus where we were last quarter, and there's nothing significant going on in terms of the mix of compensation or the rate of change of compensation per person.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nA - Steve Weber: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. We look forward to talking with you again soon. Stay safe and healthy and thank you again.\nOperator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you to disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. As usual, I'll start with some detail around the revenue for Q2 fiscal '20. FICO's revenue for the quarter was $308 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Our application segments revenue were $140 million, down 1% versus the same period last year. The decrease in revenue was driven primarily by lower license and professional services revenue. Software applications bookings for the quarter were $48 million, down 24% from last year, due in large part to COVID-19 related disruptions and sales efforts at the end of March. In our Decision Management software segments, Q2 revenues were $39 million, up 20% over the same trade last year. This increase was primarily due to license and SaaS subscription revenues from our Decision Management platform products. Decision Management software bookings were $23 million Q2, down 17% from the previous year, similarly due to software sales disruptions at the end of the quarter. Finally, our Score segment revenues were $129 million, up 24% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 27% over the same period last year and B2C revenues were up 15% from the same period. We do expect disruptions to Scores volumes, particularly on the B2B side as loan originations decline in some credit vertical. As Will said, Scores volumes are reported to us monthly in arrears, and so we did not have visibility into the Scores volumes real time. Turning to our global revenue mix. In our second fiscal quarter, 78% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 8% was from the Asia Pacific region. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represent 78% of total revenues in the quarter consulting and implementation revenues were 16% and licensed revenues were 6% of the total. Revenues derived from our cloud delivered software as a service or SaaS products were 74 million for the quarter, which includes 58 million in transactional revenue and 17 million in professional services revenue. That's an increase of 12% from the previous year for our SaaS business. Total bookings, including our Scores segments for the quarter total a 4 million down 20% from last year, those bookings generated 12 million and current period revenues 14% yield. SaaS bookings were 31 million for the quarter, which was 6% from the previous year. Our operating expenses total 232 million in this quarter, down 14 million from the prior quarter due primarily to decreases in travel marketing and other discretionary expenses and the 3 million and restructuring costs in Q1 that did not recur in Q2. FICO's GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 25% and our non-GAAP operating margin as shown in our schedule, there's 32%. GAAP net income this quarter was 58 million up 75% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was 64 million for the quarter of 36% from the same quarter last year. Our effective tax rate this quarter was about 7%, which included about 12 million of excess cash benefits, resulting from stock based compensation activities. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 10% to 12% for the full fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was 55 million compared to 44 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the trailing four quarters was $259 million. t Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of quarter, we had $109 million in cash it was down 2 million from last quarter, primarily driven by share repurchases, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our total debt face value is $959 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.44%, at the end of the quarter we had drawn 124 million on our $400 million revolving line of credit. We anticipate growing on that facility to pay for the $85 million maturities senior notes coming up in July. Our leverage ratio is calculated for our revolving line of credit was 2.25 times. As a reminder, our current covenant is 3.0 times and that covenant will expand to 3.25 when the most mature in July. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 290,000 shares in the second quarter for $96 million and an average price of $331 per share. At the end of March, we had about $64 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. Finally, as Will said because of the uncertainty around COVID-19 and the impacts on the economic environment, we are withdrawing our previously issued financial guidance. With that I'll turn it back over to Will for some final comments. Yes. So, the big three buckets of volumes in that part of our business as you know are, the mortgage business, the auto business and then credit cards, personal loans that we call the other segment. Mortgages were up, as you would expect given some of the refi dynamics that have been in place for a number of months. And in the auto and other segments, the volume changes were, on a year-over-year basis were in the single-digit percentages, so not really anything to write all about there. With respect to the end of the quarter, the impact was close enough to the end of March, which is the last reports we have from our partners at the bureau. So, we did not see anything informative from those volumes at the end of March. Frankly what you heard from the bureaus in their quarterly reports over the last a week or number of days, have more real time information that we have on that front. So far, it's holding up nicely and with respect to myFICO for example, it's up. It's not surprising consumer is very focused on their credit if it's kind of a time. Yes. It is being pushed out. So remember, we have a very long sales cycle, 250 day sales cycle. So, we had a lot of stuff that was in process that was closer to the end and to the beginning of the process and so that's something that pushed the next quarter, some of it got close. But they haven't been hit in the way they were back in 2007, 2008. It says this is a different kind of a situation, as and so we haven't seen them pulling back on their investment plans, at least not so far. Now, it would, it probably would be naive to believe that everything will be business as usual, and I'm sure on the margin, there'll be some business that we were hoping for that won't happen. But, but we haven't seen tremendous changes in behavior other than the timeline for getting transactions done slowing down a little bit. Yes, Bill, we haven't shared those in the past. I don't think this is the forum to change that disclosure practice. But I guess I can say that it hasn't changed materially at least to the end of March to what we had in the past in the past four years. It's two things, so as you may recall, we had a restructuring expense last quarter, a part of that was to reduce head count. And so, there's some of that. And then also we accrued throughout the year, yearend incentive bonuses, both cash and stock-based, based on certain expected outcome and that outcome exceeded or underperformed. And rate at which we accrue the yearend does have an impact on that period-to-period labor costs. The big picture though is that, head count is essentially flat. I think it's up 0.5% versus where we were last quarter, and there's nothing significant going on in terms of the mix of compensation or the rate of change of compensation per person."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. First, I hope you and your families are healthy and staying safe as we go through this pandemic. As we all know, these are unprecedented time. No one can predict with any certainty the scale or length of disruption from COVID-19 or how severe the economic and health impacts will be. Many unknowns include the scope and effect of further public health responses as well as governmental, regulatory, fiscal and monetary policies. As we usually do, we've posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing a few of those today during our presentation. Today, I'll go over the results for our second fiscal quarter and first half of the year, then I'll talk about how we're viewing our business in light of the current situation and how we plan to execute on a plan to remain strong, while preparing for the opportunities when this crisis ends. As we show on Slide 2, we've been successful in moving to a work-from-home structure and have not skipped a beat in how we serve the needs of our customers. In fact, nearly all of our 4,000 person global workforce are currently working from home. We responded early, closing our China offices in February, and we followed the lead of local state and national authorities and 43 offices and 32 different countries. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees who've responded to the quickly unfolding circumstances and have allowed us to adjust to ensure that key internal and client side deliverables remain on track. We were well prepared to move to this model. Over the last year, we've increased our usage of video based communications. Before the pandemic, it was a valuable tool to drive collaboration or reduce travel is now critical business practice. Our technology team had already built a robust VPN infrastructure that permits remote access to secured networks and servers. That infrastructure and our cloud-based solutions and support has meant that we are able to serve our customers without any significant loss of productivity, and as always, our cyber security team has been focused on protecting customers environments and sensitive data. It hasn't been easy. They're uncertain stressful times for everyone. But I'm proud of the business continuity efforts we've undertaken to prepare for potential issues, whatever they may be and how those efforts have paid extraordinary dividends as we are able to adapt to the challenge as we face. Finally, we've established an internal coronavirus response team. These are all examples of resilient culture of dedicated professionals are stepping up to the daily challenges we face. So, I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong second fiscal quarter. We reported revenues of 308 million, an increase of 11% over the same period last year. We delivered 58 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $1.94 per share. We delivered 64 million of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.14. This fact that we began to experience COVID related this -- in spite of the fact that we've begun to experience the COVID-related disruption in late March, we were able to generate 84 million in new bookings, which is impressive considering the most of our deals are closed at the end of the quarter right when businesses were closing, and everyone was transitioning to work from home. We continue to have a strong pipeline and believe many of our solutions are exactly what our customers are looking for as they focus on risk management. Our software revenue was up minus 3%, this quarter, applications were down 1%. As we had fewer up front license sales and less services revenue than last year. Decision Management software was up 20% with increases in both license sales and transactional revenue some fields we've signed previous quarters. In this course business, we had another great quarter due to special pricing that began to take effect. Total revenues were up 24% versus the prior year and total of 129 million. On the B2B side, revenues were up 27 over the same period as last year. B2C revenues were up 15% this quarter. Scores, particularly B2B is also an area of risk during volatile economic times, as some of those revenues are tied to things like origination of new loans. The strength of our business and our conservative financial practices have allowed us to build a healthy balance sheet. As you can see on Slide 4, we have ample liquidity and borrowing capacity. But as we look ahead, it's impossible to fully understand what the possible impacts to our markets will be and predict when the economy will improve. Because of these uncertainties, we are retracting our full year guidance. I'd like to direct you to Slide 5 to remind everyone what our original guidance was, where we stand now halfway through the year, and what we would need to do in the back half to achieve those original numbers. In this version currency this slide provides more details of our guidance than what we previously disclosed including more granularity around revenues. The red highlight areas of potential higher risk in the coming months. With B2B Scores, as I said, it's difficult for us to accurately forecast what will happen with volumes in the near term. Because these Scores are sold through bureaus that report to us in arrears, we don't have visibility to real-time data. In times of disruption, this is especially difficult until we can begin to see the trends in the data. We anecdotally know that, mortgage volumes have been strong and auto has been weak, but it's difficult to quantify what's happening today level on the next several months. Now on the software side, we have a great deal of visibility into our transactional and maintenance revenue streams. I believe those revenues to be very resilient. It's more difficult to estimate how many deals we'll be able to close and what potential impacts that would have on license and service revenue. We know that, we have a strong pipeline of deals and fully expect to close many of them, but there's clearly more uncertainty than there was a few months ago. We also believe that, we'll spend less-than originally planned. We will likely see savings in some revenue-based expenses and we'll spend less on travel and marketing and other discretionary areas. We're scrutinizing our expenses more than ever and we're committed to being as efficient as possible. In short, we don't know the severity or duration of disruptions in credit markets or technology purchases. Declines in Scores volumes will have a negative impact on our revenues despite the special pricing that we start to see this quarter, but it's difficult to know, for instance, if declines in auto sales now create a backlog of buyers in the fall or if it is part of a longer downturn. And while sales cycles for our solutions will likely be longer, we don't yet know how much is due to customers reassessing purchases versus the logistical challenges of remote selling. That said, we remain confident in our business model. We've got a great start to the year. We have a large amount of recurring revenue. While we expect our software revenues in the second half of the year to be lower than our guidance due to COVID-19, we also expect expenses to decline to primarily to reduce sales marketing expense and employee travel. These expense reductions will mitigate the impact on our bottom-line and we expect to have other operating expense savings due to general disruptions. So even though top line volatility is difficult to predict, we could still meet our original bottom-line guidance with a number of factors play off. These are exceptionally volatile times, but we remain optimistic and are actively managing the business to breach the short-term difficulties while building long-term value. I'll share some summary thoughts later, but now I'd like to turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Okay. Work from home challenges. I'd like to end our prepared remarks today with some positive news. We're conducting a series of live webinars that we're calling building resiliency, adapting to the challenges of today. These webinars, which are almost virtual cycle world, began last week and continue through May 28. The topics falls in six tracks adaptability, digital customer engagement, risk management, operational efficiency, building trust and protecting customers. I'd encourage you to check it out information's available on our website and there are a number of keynote sessions that I think will be of interest to our investors, including one I'll be doing jointly with Equifax's CEO, Mark Begor, on May 14th. Finally, I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. These are challenging times, but I'm convinced we're up to the challenge. We can't control the external factors we face, but we can control how we respond and plan for the future. We're stewards of remarkable assets and we remain optimistic as we look to the future. We'll bridge this period of disruption as we have in the past and will emerge as place for growth. I'll be as transparent as possible as we work through this uncertainty and will provide guidance as soon as we have better understand the economics and commercial environment. So, I'll now turn it back to Steve for Q& A. You're talking about B2C, Manav? B2B, Mike, I don't know if you have the details on that. Bill, I think, as Mike mentioned a minute ago, I think broadly we can mortgage looks like it's going to be up, auto looks like it's going to be way down, credit cards and personal loans down, but I think you probably do better reading into the numbers that you see from the Bureau's then asking us to speculate because we don't have it. Mike, do you have those percentages? I don't know if you have any handy? I think, Bill, you expect it will take every step is within our power to manage our expenses to maximize the margin. So, while we don't have complete control over the top line, we obviously have a little more control over the bottom line. And so I would hope that we could do better than preserving the rate. But again, if you look at the slide in our deck, we basically laid out what would happen have to be true for us to hit the prior guidance. Well, as the impact COVID has been on our company, we were engaged in and continue to be engaged in a really extensive review of every activity that we have going on in the Company, and our goal is to really focus on things that are truly strategic and to de-emphasize things that are less strategic. And that initiative, that work proceed the pace that it has not been slowed at least by COVID. I think if anything, we're more committed than ever to getting as as much of our capability onto the platform as quickly as possible so we can start to see the returns to scale that we're all looking for. So, I would say that, our investments plans on a strategic and platform stuff completely unchanged. If anything, we're looking for ways to free up resources to put even more against it. But then things that are off-platform, off-strategy, we're scrutinizing those barriers. We think it's going to be very big. It's not going to generate any revenue in the near-term, because our plan is to provide it for free along with FICO Scores. So if you buy a FICO Score, you can also get the FICO Resiliency Index along with it. We think that, there is commensurate, maybe worth spending just a minute on what it is. This is some really smart stuff that our guys came up with. That helps us to differentiate amongst consumers and evaluate their credit within any particular FICO Score, that's at a point in time and at a point in the economic cycle. And there are individuals who are more resilient and they're individuals who are less resilient. And the traditional way of dealing with downturns and we see it today is that, lenders, raise their lending thresholds. They raised their cutoff, and while obviously that's a prudent thing to do, we'd love for that to be a little more sophisticated and surgical and be able to evaluate some of the individuals below those cutoffs and with more precision. And that's really what the FICO Resiliency Index does. It'll be bundled with the FICO Score. It will be widely available to anyone who's buying FICO Scores. It is currently in test, as you said with Equifax and the Dow. Experian will have it out too. TU should follow. And yes, we have high expectations because it's been very well received to-date. We were seeing more in CCS and customer communication that's up a bit because the lenders are engaged in a lot more back and forth with their consumer customers than they have been in the past. So, that does a little the others, not tremendously different investment and we're not saying dudes proportional or anything. We don't we don't break it out, we don't break it out. I think it's fair to assume that there'll be a little less origination activity. I mean, that's not unreasonable. We would have felt it. Yes, it's come in. Well, I think that they're much better prepared than the last time their balance sheets are stronger. They have more capital on hand. They, learn the last time around, and I also think that the government and the fed has jumped in a way that very quickly in a way that they didn't the last time around to ponder and so I think it's those kinds of things. And as you can see from their public statements, if you really if you look at the public statements from the big bank CEOs, they're, they're obviously planning to weather this much better than the last time around. Since, as I mentioned earlier there's more usage of our customer communication services, which is the last mile to customer consumer, customer contacts, that those volumes are up. Remember loan sales cycle and so you wouldn't see things change quickly. The things that are in place, we're seeing more volume in places you'd expect like that, like they see CCS. But otherwise, we're not and then we're expecting with all the transaction volume down, credit card transaction volume down. It may have an impact on Falcon volumes. But, most of our Falcon business is priced by account. And so, I'm not sure how much impact it was really have on us. So, the answer is yes. We strongly believe that, it's a tremendous tool. FICO is tremendous tool for evaluating credit worthiness and more needed, more necessary, more in demand than ever in times like these. The Resiliency Index that I mentioned earlier is tied up in that. And so, the way we think about it, we are constantly innovating and trying to find ways to bring evermore sophistication to that evaluation to that decision and that's worked out pretty well. Will they be pulling account management support more frequently in these times, to be determined? We'll see. We'll see. It wouldn't be a shock. Yes. I mean that's been going on for years. There are players out there who provide non-FICO Scores to consumers to help them, to give them a sense for what their credit worthiness. But since lenders predominantly use FICO Scores, there's a mismatch there. Consumers are sometimes confused, but we've been working for a long time. I'm trying to clear up that confusion and make sure that consumers understand that, a credit score is not a FICO Score unless it's a FICO score. And that, what they are trying -- what the consumer trying to understand is, what the lender thinks of them? What the lender's evaluation of their credit worthiness is than the FICO Scores a way to do it, we have arrangement with Experian, our partner where Experian provides FICO Scores to the consumers and their consumer offerings. We offer obviously FICO Scores in our own consumer offering in myFICO. We think that there's more appetite and interest in that than ever. Just kind of given the situation, people are concerned about their credit. And so, we feel pretty good about that business is tied to the origination of credit cards in the sense that there's a time there that'll slow that down. Experian is bigger than myFICO. It's a -- revenues experience -- no, myFICO is a good business too, a good-sized business, too. I don't think we break out the specifics of it, but experience is also very important to that business. Most of our Scores businesses is price per Score. Well, we're pretty happy with the model that we have. I don't know that we're looking to modify it. Right, we have historically paid a little bit extra attention to from a sales force perspective to selling DMS base products. But at the end of the day, we sell to our customers what they need, and with the DMS base, fantastic; and if it's not, then so be it, we'll do it that way. So -- and we compensate our sales people regardless of what it is they sell. I think your points well taken though, and as we think into the future, we likely will favor DMS sales over non-DMS sales. So, that I think that is a, that's a piece of business to really watch, that's the future. If you're asking about COVID, specific kind of implications that you just mentioned them, it's things like travel, and it's the fact that when revenues lower, we have less expenses associated with servicing that revenue. So, that part is for sure. I wouldn't say that, we're in a place where suddenly because of COVID our backs are to the wall and we have to rethink our entire expense structure. I think we're doing the thing that management always does, which is reviewing whether every dollar is well spent and we are engaged in that process and continue to be engaged in that process. But I wouldn't call it an emergency or a response to COVID. I think just running the business. Absolutely. Mike, do you want to take that?"

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Thursday, January 30, 2020. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please, go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations; and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today, for a reconciliation of each of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 30, 2021. And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'd say we're off to a good start, delivering growth across our portfolio and also delivering innovation. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $299 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $55 million of GAAP net income, up 37%; and GAAP earnings of $1.82, up 38%. On a non-GAAP basis, the $1.80 earnings per share was up 24% from last year. And we delivered free cash flow growth as well, up 27% from fiscal 2019. On the software side of our business, the innovation we're bringing to market is gaining traction among companies eager to use analytics-driven decisioning to solve their most difficult problems. At FICO World in November, we hosted more than 1,400 attendees, representing 600 companies from 62 countries. During the conference, our solution specialists held close to 1,100 consultations. We sat down with customers and potential customers to understand their business issues and explain and demonstrate how FICO's advanced analytics, digital decisioning and dynamic workflows can transform their business. The innovation on display at FICO World continues to translate into robust sales in our software business. We had another good bookings quarter at $112 million. The $49 million of DMS bookings was the second largest quarter, after last quarter's $61 million, in FICO's history. That means we've booked about $110 million in DMS business in the last two quarters. I'm convinced we're developing software at the same time demand is emerging for analytic-based decisioning software. In our Scores business, we had another good quarter. Scores were up 34% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 46% over the prior year. Our B2C revenues were up 11% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to see strength throughout the Scores marketplace. We also announced some innovations in our Scores business, the release of the FICO Score 10 Suite. The suite has two new scores. FICO Score 10 relies on credit bureau data and is consistent with previous FICO Score versions that are in the market today. It reflects a normal model development cadence, extending features that were introduced in FICO Score 8 and FICO Score 9. FICO Score 10 is designed to be backward-compatible with previous Score versions. FICO Score 10T incorporates a broader set of credit bureau data, including trended data, which captures unique aspects of the consumer's financial profile over time. While the blueprint design is similar, it uses new characteristics to enhance predictive power. Both FICO Score 10 and FICO Score 10T demonstrate greater predictive power over all previous versions of the FICO Score and were developed on recent data sets. By adopting the FICO Score 10 Suite, a lender can reduce the number of defaults in its portfolio by as much as 10% among newly originated bank cards, 9% among newly originated auto loans compared to using FICO Score 9. The reduction in default is even higher for newly originated mortgage loans at 17% compared to the version of the FICO Score used in that industry. These improvements in predictive power can help lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates, while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. We believe this type of innovation, which we've developed with significant feedback from the lending community, will significantly increase performance and allow the industry to expand loans and revenue, while not increasing losses. We will continue to update you on this and other score innovations that we'll announce in the coming months. I'll talk more about how we see the year playing out, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. FICO's total revenue for the quarter was $299 million dollars, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Breaking that down into our reported segments, our applications revenues were $152 million, up 3% from the same period last year. This increase in revenue was driven by higher professional services revenues as well as higher usage-based software revenues. Software applications bookings for the quarter were $56 million, down 6% from last year. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q1 revenues were $31 million, up 8% over the same period last year. This increase was primarily due to services and usage-based revenues in our Decision Management platform. DMS bookings were $49 million in Q1, up 56% from the previous year, which, as Will pointed out, is the second highest booking quarter in this segment's history at FICO. Finally, our Scores segment revenues were $115 million, up 34% from the same period last year. The B2B portion of our Scores segment was up 46% over the same period last year. And B2C revenues were up 11% -- B2C revenues were up 11% from last year. We had strong volumes throughout the Scores vertical and also signed an annual licensing deal worth several million dollars that was all recognized in the first quarter due to the new ASC 606 accounting rules. In our first quarter, 76% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 16%, and the remaining 8% was from Asia Pacific. Looking at our revenue by type for the quarter. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources represented 74% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation revenues were 15% of total revenues, and software license revenues were 11% of the total. Revenues derived from our cloud-delivered software-as-a-service products were $74 million for the quarter, which included $57 million in transactional software revenues and $17 million in professional services, an increase of 16% from the previous year in total. Bookings for the quarter totaled $112 million, up 5% from last year. These bookings generated $16 million of current period revenue, a 14% yield. SaaS bookings were $37 million for the quarter, down 16% from the previous year. Our operating expenses totaled $247 million in this quarter, up $11 million from the prior quarter; due primarily to expenses associated with FICO World in November and increased personnel costs. We also incurred about $3 million in restructuring costs related to headcount reduction actions taken during the first quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 27% for the quarter. GAAP net income this quarter was $55 million, up 37% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $54 million for the quarter, up 23% from the same quarter last year. As you will see from our non-GAAP reconciliation, we had a large reduction to income tax expense this quarter of $22 million or $0.73 per share associated with excess tax benefits, resulting from stock-based compensation activities. This left us with an effective tax rate of negative 31%. As we said last quarter, we expect our effective tax rate, inclusive of excess tax benefits, to be around 16% to 17% for the fiscal year. FICO's free cash flow for the quarter was $54 million compared to $42 million in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the trailing four quarters was $248 million. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had $111 million in cash. This is up $5 million from last quarter due to cash generated from ops, partially offset by $60 million in share repurchases. Our total debt face value today is at $930 million, including $95 million outstanding on our revolving line of credit. Our debt has a weighted average interest rate of 4.57%. During the quarter, we issued $350 million of callable notes, which will mature in 2028. The fixed rate on those new notes is 4%. Proceeds of the notes were used to repay a portion of the revolving credit facility. We anticipate drawing on the revolving credit facility to pay for the $85 million maturity of senior notes that is coming due in July. And turning to return of capital. We bought back 168,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $356 per share. Total cash used for buybacks, as I mentioned, in the quarter, was $60 million. At the end of December quarter, we had about $160 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization. And finally, we are confirming our previously issued full year financial guidance for fiscal 2020. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 2020.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we're well positioned for success as we move into 2020 and beyond. Our Scores business continues to excel, and we work hard to get feedback from lenders and regulators to make sure we provide analytics to protect the safety and soundness of lending decisions. On the software side, we're producing higher bookings and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue. We continue to look for innovative ways to serve our customers and improve efficiency in our business. We do all of it with an eye toward building shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Steve for Q&A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for our first question, and it comes from the line of Bill Warmington with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nBill Warmington: Good evening, everyone.\nWill Lansing: Hey, Bill.\nBill Warmington: So the first question I wanted to ask was about the strong license revenue on the Scores side of the business. You normally don't see a lot of license revenue in Scores, and just want to ask for some detail on that?\nWill Lansing: Bill, I wouldn't read too, too much into it. It was \u2013 we did one larger deal and the way it was structured was as a license, and so we got a disproportionate pop there, but I would not read all too much into that.\nBill Warmington: Okay. And then on the Scores business, you guys have talked about special price increases. We've seen a couple over the past two years in mortgage and in auto. Have you guys put through a special price increase in January? And if so, maybe you could talk a little bit about it?\nWill Lansing: Yes, we have. And it's just gone into effect, and so we really haven't had an opportunity to read the results yet.\nBill Warmington: Okay. Are you feeling good about it so far?\nWill Lansing: Well, I always feel good about our business.\nBill Warmington: Is it perhaps in the credit card portion of the business?\nWill Lansing: Some credit card is affected, yes.\nBill Warmington: Okay. Okay. Switching over to the software part of the business. Today, all of your APIs are inward facing, meaning that your internal developers are using those tools to build applications on the DMS platform. Is the plan to make those APIs available externally? And if so, what kind of time frame?\nWill Lansing: Bill, that is a great question. A lot of insight in that question. We very much plan to turn our APIs so that they're outward-facing, eventually. That's probably, realistically, an 18 to 24-month time frame before we can do that. The advantage of it, the strategy behind it is, as you know, we're taking our solutions, which are mostly financial services-oriented, we're getting them onto the platforms that we have multi-tenant, standardized, highly configurable solutions with real returns to scale. When we can turn the APIs outward, a bunch of good things happen. First, we can enlist partners to do customization beyond the API so that it's not our job. It becomes that of VARs and resellers and others who help us to get that done. Second, we'll be able to move into verticals beyond financial services, where we don't have a sales force but where there's an appetite. And I would say that's true for all B2C companies. Any B2C company that wants to get into data-driven decisioning and optimizing their consumer interactions, which tend to benefit from [Technical Difficulty] platform. The outward-facing APIs will let them have vertical custom kinds of solutions based on our platform. But it's very much our strategy. Frankly, it's an inflection point for our software business when we achieve that.\nBill Warmington: And then I just wanted to ask a question on the SaaS bookings, on the $37 million, that those were down on a year-over-year basis. Is that CCS impact? Or is something else impacting that?\nMike McLaughlin: Bill, it's Mike. There's nothing particularly noteworthy in terms of where that shortfall is relative to typical bookings pattern. It's a reflection of the fact that bookings are relatively lumpy in our business and this is our seasonally slowest quarter in terms of bookings. As you know, it's typically kind of high-teens to 20% of full year bookings that come in, in the first quarter. So if you combine a relatively lumpy business, i.e., lots of large deals with the smallest sample set being the lowest seasonal quarter, just the chances for an aberration that doesn't have sort of long-term statistical significance is high. And that's how you should think about this. We continue to feel good about how that business is growing in terms of external demand and booking pipeline. So I think it's a -- I think it's just a one-off this quarter.\nBill Warmington: Yes. And then last question for me, if I could. The FICO 10 and the FICO 10T, your thoughts on when the GSEs are going to actually adopt those?\nWill Lansing: Boy, that's a little hard to say. We certainly expect these courses to be in the consideration set.\nBill Warmington: All right. Well thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is...\nManav Patnaik: Thank you, good evening guys. Just to follow-up on the Scores pricing, I know you said some card and you did something in January. But is the mortgage and auto pieces that you did in the prior two years, are those fully cycled through, or is there incremental opportunities there still there?\nWill Lansing: I think you should think of them as being fully cycled through, to use your words. It's been in place for a while now.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. And then just, I guess, on the B2C side, I mean, that was some -- 11% was a pretty good number. Are there -- is it pretty broadly diversified? Or is that your experience in relationship? I was just hoping you could give us some more color on the trends you're seeing there?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes, it's broadly diversified, Manav. There's again, nothing that really sticks its head up as being -- as a single explanation. But it's both our own platform and the third-party relationships we have.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just, Mike, maybe on the margin front, hoping maybe if you could just help us with the moving pieces there like how much of it was maybe the FICO World impact to your point, timing and lumpiness in software, obviously, can be all over the place. How should we think about the progression through the course of the year?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. So we talked at the end of last quarter about 2020 being a year where we're going to begin to focus on turning the margins more favorable. In this quarter, we took a relatively small restructuring charge associated with headcount reduction. Most of the financial impact of that won't be realized -- financial benefit from that won't be realized until the second quarter and beyond. But we do expect that benefit to materialize. In the first quarter, we also had FICO World and of course that restructuring expense itself. And if you take those out, probably 4% of our expense growth on an OpEx basis was due to those things. And so we're still growing OpEx at a rate that is double-digit, but lower than income -- lower than revenue growth. We expect as the year progresses, as we gain some more efficiencies and focus more on cost that the operating leverage, the difference between revenue growth and expense growth will be greater than that. But you're not seeing much of it yet in the first quarter.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. Thank you guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Can you just remind me, it's the company's typical methodology to adjust the full year guidance as warranted past second quarter for special pricing as a bit more time has passed, we shouldn't read anything into just maintaining this guidance in terms of the implementation of how the special pricing as the implementation is going on that front, correct?\nWill Lansing: We don't really have a schedule for adjusting guidance. The guidance that we give at any point in time is our best estimate of where we're going to be. And so the guidance that we have in place is what we believe to be the guidance.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then can you just help me on the application, transaction and maintenance performance in the quarter? It was pretty muted growth, the lowest year-over-year it's been in a while. Just anything about end market transaction activity, timing factors, just any reason why there would be slower growth there?\nWill Lansing: I think that, the best way to think about it is it's by design. We are \u2013 if you take a step back and you look at the transition that we're making from license on-premise, software business, which was what we were historically and predominantly, and the transition to our future state of multi-tenant, standardized, configurable platform business, there's an in-between stage. And the in-between stage, which is strategically impure, but important competitively, is to be able to provide our solutions in the cloud, even if they're single tenant hosted, even if they're not the end-state software platform that we'd like them to be. And so we are in a migration pattern here, where three of our top five franchises, we've moved to the platform. Two of our top five have not yet moved to the platform. And yet we're not willing to abandon our customer's needs for having some of those solutions in the cloud. And so what we do is we take that business even though it's lower margin business, because we think it's strategic. We want to keep competitors out. We want to satisfy our customers. But the returns to scale really come when those solutions are fully migrated over to the standardized multi-tenant platform. So, the balance we strike in our software business is that there is more business available in this in between space than we care to do. And so we basically \u2013 we basically meet the demand that we think is appropriate to meet our strategic customer needs without overdoing it. And that's really how we think about that, call it, a lower revenue growth rate in the short-term.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then just last, you've had a competitor call out some, I guess, bookings delays in the U.K. just given the macro concerns, Brexit concerns. Just any comment on, if you're seeing something similar or how the U.K. is going for you? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: Not really. Our EMEA business, our U.K. business is fine.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon. I'd like to start a question about the FICO Score 10 Suite. Can you talk a little bit about the benefit of providing the FICO 10 Score versus the 10T in the sense that at face value, obviously, 10T comes across as a superior score, but then it sounds like FICO 10T was \u2013 or FICO 10 was introduced for backwards compatibility? Is that the primary way that clients will be thinking about it? And how should we be thinking about the reason why it's important?\nWill Lansing: Yeah, I think that's \u2013 that's a good characterization of the difference. So, we have \u2013 the goal is always to have a more predictive score and to help lenders make better decisions. We have a kind of a regular cadence of updating our scores every several years. And so FICO Score 10 is right on-time for the update from FICO 9. It is completely backward-compatible. So it's the same reason codes, and although the weighting of some of the factors is different, it can be used interchangeably in some sense with FICO 9. With FICO 10T, we're using different data sets, the trended data, and we've introduced some additional reason codes. And what that does is it makes it not so backwards-compatible, but it does provide better predictiveness for certain kinds of things. So that's the right way to think about it is backward compatibility versus not.\nSurinder Thind: Understood, and then, from a -- generally, from a client perspective, how much more, I'll say, effort would be involved, in going to FICO 10T? Because, I assume that will become the new paradigm in terms of -- like you wouldn't have another -- let's say the next-generation without a completely different set of FICO Scores. Because I think you'd obviously want to maintain further compatibility from 10T and beyond, I assume. And so...\nWill Lansing: Every lender is different and what you see is different, lenders have different adoption rates for new scores. We still have FICO 9, out there. Obviously, we have FICO 8. We have earlier scores that are still very much in use. And still work just fine. So it's up to the lender to decide at what pace they want to change the scores that they use. Obviously, Fintechs and startups and brand-new customers gravitate to the latest and greatest, which would be 10 and 10T.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then, touching base on an earlier topic about the software revenues, I think you characterized them as, there's some natural volatility. And this quarter, in particular, tends to be the lightest of here. Can you also talk a little bit about perhaps -- and I just want to verify or at least the color that you were providing around. When we think about software margins for the year, is the goal there to keep them essentially flat year-over-year? Or how should we just think about that versus the overall firm-wide margins?\nWill Lansing: I think flat is safe. We take it as we go here. We're -- right now, we're trying to focus on matching expenses and revenue growth, so that we don't have big changes in margin one way or the other. Maybe we'll do a little better than that, maybe a little bit worse. That depends on kind of how the factors in the year shake out.\nSurinder Thind: And I apologize for -- is that at the firm-wide level or is that at the software level? Sorry.\nMike McLaughlin: That's at the software level. Obviously, the margins -- the incremental margins in the score is very, very different. And our goal is, in the software business, to as I say start to show some improvement there over time. But this year, as we're kind of turning the steering well a little bit there. As Will said, safe -- flat is safe. And we'd be happy if it's better than that.\nSurinder Thind: Understood, and then one final follow-up question. I think one of the -- I think the more anticipated product launches is going to be the new Falcon suite towards the end of the year. As you roll that product suite out, how should we think about the strategy around that? Is the idea to migrate as many existing users over to that platform? Or is it to let the natural client upgrade cycle run its course. And maybe target as many new users for that platform as possible? And I think you guys were kind of providing some color around that. But any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\nWill Lansing: Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter. I think that, our customers decide their rate and pace of upgrades. And our software tends to go in and stay in for quite a long time. It has a long shelf life. And so we're not pushing customers to migrate early or quickly. We do it on the pace that they want. If they want to do it right away, great. And if they want to take their time, that's also okay. We -- certainly, for new customers, we're going to be pushing them in the direction of our latest and greatest products.\nSurinder Thind: Okay, that's helpful. And that's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: And Mr. Weber, there are no further questions, at present time. I'll turn the call back to yourself. Thank you.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. This concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. Good bye.\nOperator: We thank you for your participation. And ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. I'd say we're off to a good start, delivering growth across our portfolio and also delivering innovation. In our first quarter, we reported revenues of $299 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $55 million of GAAP net income, up 37%; and GAAP earnings of $1.82, up 38%. On a non-GAAP basis, the $1.80 earnings per share was up 24% from last year. And we delivered free cash flow growth as well, up 27% from fiscal 2019. On the software side of our business, the innovation we're bringing to market is gaining traction among companies eager to use analytics-driven decisioning to solve their most difficult problems. At FICO World in November, we hosted more than 1,400 attendees, representing 600 companies from 62 countries. During the conference, our solution specialists held close to 1,100 consultations. We sat down with customers and potential customers to understand their business issues and explain and demonstrate how FICO's advanced analytics, digital decisioning and dynamic workflows can transform their business. The innovation on display at FICO World continues to translate into robust sales in our software business. We had another good bookings quarter at $112 million. The $49 million of DMS bookings was the second largest quarter, after last quarter's $61 million, in FICO's history. That means we've booked about $110 million in DMS business in the last two quarters. I'm convinced we're developing software at the same time demand is emerging for analytic-based decisioning software. In our Scores business, we had another good quarter. Scores were up 34% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 46% over the prior year. Our B2C revenues were up 11% versus the first quarter of 2019. We continue to see strength throughout the Scores marketplace. We also announced some innovations in our Scores business, the release of the FICO Score 10 Suite. The suite has two new scores. FICO Score 10 relies on credit bureau data and is consistent with previous FICO Score versions that are in the market today. It reflects a normal model development cadence, extending features that were introduced in FICO Score 8 and FICO Score 9. FICO Score 10 is designed to be backward-compatible with previous Score versions. FICO Score 10T incorporates a broader set of credit bureau data, including trended data, which captures unique aspects of the consumer's financial profile over time. While the blueprint design is similar, it uses new characteristics to enhance predictive power. Both FICO Score 10 and FICO Score 10T demonstrate greater predictive power over all previous versions of the FICO Score and were developed on recent data sets. By adopting the FICO Score 10 Suite, a lender can reduce the number of defaults in its portfolio by as much as 10% among newly originated bank cards, 9% among newly originated auto loans compared to using FICO Score 9. The reduction in default is even higher for newly originated mortgage loans at 17% compared to the version of the FICO Score used in that industry. These improvements in predictive power can help lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates, while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. We believe this type of innovation, which we've developed with significant feedback from the lending community, will significantly increase performance and allow the industry to expand loans and revenue, while not increasing losses. We will continue to update you on this and other score innovations that we'll announce in the coming months. I'll talk more about how we see the year playing out, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I believe we're well positioned for success as we move into 2020 and beyond. Our Scores business continues to excel, and we work hard to get feedback from lenders and regulators to make sure we provide analytics to protect the safety and soundness of lending decisions. On the software side, we're producing higher bookings and building a backlog of recurring transactional revenue. We continue to look for innovative ways to serve our customers and improve efficiency in our business. We do all of it with an eye toward building shareholder value. I'll now turn the call back over to Steve for Q&A. Hey, Bill. Bill, I wouldn't read too, too much into it. It was \u2013 we did one larger deal and the way it was structured was as a license, and so we got a disproportionate pop there, but I would not read all too much into that. Yes, we have. And it's just gone into effect, and so we really haven't had an opportunity to read the results yet. Well, I always feel good about our business. Some credit card is affected, yes. Bill, that is a great question. A lot of insight in that question. We very much plan to turn our APIs so that they're outward-facing, eventually. That's probably, realistically, an 18 to 24-month time frame before we can do that. The advantage of it, the strategy behind it is, as you know, we're taking our solutions, which are mostly financial services-oriented, we're getting them onto the platforms that we have multi-tenant, standardized, highly configurable solutions with real returns to scale. When we can turn the APIs outward, a bunch of good things happen. First, we can enlist partners to do customization beyond the API so that it's not our job. It becomes that of VARs and resellers and others who help us to get that done. Second, we'll be able to move into verticals beyond financial services, where we don't have a sales force but where there's an appetite. And I would say that's true for all B2C companies. Any B2C company that wants to get into data-driven decisioning and optimizing their consumer interactions, which tend to benefit from [Technical Difficulty] platform. The outward-facing APIs will let them have vertical custom kinds of solutions based on our platform. But it's very much our strategy. Frankly, it's an inflection point for our software business when we achieve that. Boy, that's a little hard to say. We certainly expect these courses to be in the consideration set. I think you should think of them as being fully cycled through, to use your words. It's been in place for a while now. We don't really have a schedule for adjusting guidance. The guidance that we give at any point in time is our best estimate of where we're going to be. And so the guidance that we have in place is what we believe to be the guidance. I think that, the best way to think about it is it's by design. We are \u2013 if you take a step back and you look at the transition that we're making from license on-premise, software business, which was what we were historically and predominantly, and the transition to our future state of multi-tenant, standardized, configurable platform business, there's an in-between stage. And the in-between stage, which is strategically impure, but important competitively, is to be able to provide our solutions in the cloud, even if they're single tenant hosted, even if they're not the end-state software platform that we'd like them to be. And so we are in a migration pattern here, where three of our top five franchises, we've moved to the platform. Two of our top five have not yet moved to the platform. And yet we're not willing to abandon our customer's needs for having some of those solutions in the cloud. And so what we do is we take that business even though it's lower margin business, because we think it's strategic. We want to keep competitors out. We want to satisfy our customers. But the returns to scale really come when those solutions are fully migrated over to the standardized multi-tenant platform. So, the balance we strike in our software business is that there is more business available in this in between space than we care to do. And so we basically \u2013 we basically meet the demand that we think is appropriate to meet our strategic customer needs without overdoing it. And that's really how we think about that, call it, a lower revenue growth rate in the short-term. Not really. Our EMEA business, our U.K. business is fine. Yeah, I think that's \u2013 that's a good characterization of the difference. So, we have \u2013 the goal is always to have a more predictive score and to help lenders make better decisions. We have a kind of a regular cadence of updating our scores every several years. And so FICO Score 10 is right on-time for the update from FICO 9. It is completely backward-compatible. So it's the same reason codes, and although the weighting of some of the factors is different, it can be used interchangeably in some sense with FICO 9. With FICO 10T, we're using different data sets, the trended data, and we've introduced some additional reason codes. And what that does is it makes it not so backwards-compatible, but it does provide better predictiveness for certain kinds of things. So that's the right way to think about it is backward compatibility versus not. Every lender is different and what you see is different, lenders have different adoption rates for new scores. We still have FICO 9, out there. Obviously, we have FICO 8. We have earlier scores that are still very much in use. And still work just fine. So it's up to the lender to decide at what pace they want to change the scores that they use. Obviously, Fintechs and startups and brand-new customers gravitate to the latest and greatest, which would be 10 and 10T. I think flat is safe. We take it as we go here. We're -- right now, we're trying to focus on matching expenses and revenue growth, so that we don't have big changes in margin one way or the other. Maybe we'll do a little better than that, maybe a little bit worse. That depends on kind of how the factors in the year shake out. Yeah. I would say it's more of the latter. I think that, our customers decide their rate and pace of upgrades. And our software tends to go in and stay in for quite a long time. It has a long shelf life. And so we're not pushing customers to migrate early or quickly. We do it on the pace that they want. If they want to do it right away, great. And if they want to take their time, that's also okay. We -- certainly, for new customers, we're going to be pushing them in the direction of our latest and greatest products."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, November 10, 2021. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 10, 2022. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 capped another terrific year, a year in which we posted record revenues, earnings and cash flows. And we were able to do this despite headwinds in fiscal '21 due to a shift in the timing of revenue recognition for term license subscription sales and the sale of 2 product lines in our software business and the managed and deliberate decline in our software and professional services revenues. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $335 million in Q4 and $1.32 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We were able to grow our full year revenue despite these negative revenue factors. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $392 million of GAAP net income and $13.40 of earnings per share, which includes the gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million, up 15%. And earnings per share of $3.92 was up 21% from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter. Full year non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% over last year. And non-GAAP EPS of $13.07 was up 34% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $90 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $416 million, up 21% from the previous year. In fiscal 2021, we continued our commitment to shareholder return, buying back $882 million of stock during the year. We increased our leverage by about $425 million compared to year-end fiscal '20, but our adjusted leverage ratio remains a modest 2.07x. We view FICO shares as the best use of our excess cash at this time and expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares in the coming year. We had another solid year and making steady progress on our strategic initiatives. In our Scores segment, our diversification of verticals has enabled us to continue to drive growth even as various sectors slow down. Scores were up 10% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 24% for the full year, as you can see on Page 7 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 2% in the quarter versus the prior year, which had a onetime royalty true-up. Adjusting for that, revenues were up about 15% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. As expected, we saw a slowdown in mortgage origination volumes, and revenues were down about 18% year-over-year. Auto origination revenues were up 19%, and card and personal loan origination revenues were up 45%. We are seeing particular strength in the card and personal loan space from our customers, including fintechs. The year-over-year pricing increases we implemented in fiscal '21 also had a positive impact on overall B2B revenues. Our B2C revenues were up 32% versus the prior year quarter and 42% for the full year compared to 2020. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO.com products as well as through our partner channels. In next year's guidance, which I'll discuss in greater detail later, we expect the Scores business to grow about 6%. There's been no change in our strategy or approach to special pricing. Accordingly, special pricing increases consistent with the past several years are not included in this guidance. While we expect these price increases to have an impact consistent with those over the last several years, because it's difficult to estimate the timing and the magnitude of the impact, we remain conservative in how we issue our guidance relative to such increases. Turning to our Software business. As we have mentioned in recent quarters, we have been developing new financial metrics that provide more visibility into the recurring revenue generated by our subscription-based SaaS and on-prem software and the retention and growth of our existing software customers. Beginning this quarter, we are pleased to unveil our revised software reporting structure and these new metrics. Mike McLaughlin will go into much more detail in his remarks, but let me give you just a few highlights.  First, we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how we assess performance and allocate resources. We merged our legacy Applications and Decision Management Software segments into a single Software segment. We continue to report the Scores segment, which is unchanged from past reporting. We also changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services and Scores to better align with our business strategy and peer reporting practices.  You'll also find in our 10-K this year our first reporting of annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which provides visibility into the growth trajectory of our Software business without the variability that comes with the upfront revenue recognition required by ASC 606 for on-prem subscription sales. We are also disclosing dollar-based net retention rate and annual contract value of software bookings. Another big change we'll be talking about is the split of our Software revenue between our on-platform and off-platform products. We'll give those splits for revenue, for ARR and for dollar-based net retention revenue. We believe it's important to focus on the progress of our on-platform offerings as it's the central strategy of our Software business. As in prior years, we will continue to focus on investing in our software platform. In fiscal '21, we divested assets that could not be easily migrated to the platform and reallocated resources to accelerate platform development and our go-to-market efforts. By allocating the resources strategically and efficiently, we expect to spur growth and achieve scale while effectively managing our operating expenses. I'm happy with the progress we made in 2021, and I'm optimistic about what lies ahead in 2022 and beyond. We'll continue to allocate our resources to areas of high strategic importance, and we'll continue to focus on long-term shareholder value.  I'll have some final comments in a moment, provide our fiscal '22 guidance then. But first, let me just turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMichael McLaughlin: Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As you may have already seen in our 10-K and the financial highlights presentation posted to the FICO website, we have made significant enhancements to our financial reporting this quarter, including the introduction of new metrics in both our Scores and Software segments. We'll briefly preview these metrics, and I will take some extra time on this call to provide more details on what we are disclosing and what new insights these numbers provide. As Will said, we have a strong finish to our fiscal year, and we are well positioned as we enter fiscal 2022. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $335 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in upfront recognition of term license revenues on-prem software sales, the sale of our Collections and Recovery product line in June and lower professional services revenue in our Software segment. Our full year revenue of $1.32 billion was up 2% over last year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $169 million, up 10% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 2% over the prior year. As you may recall, last year's fiscal fourth quarter included a onetime royalty true-up that did not recur this year. Adjusting for this onetime true-up, B2B revenue was up about 15% this quarter. B2C revenues were up 32% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. One of the new financial metrics we are adding to our 10-K and 10-Q disclosures going forward is the breakdown of our Scores segment revenues between B2B and B2C components. For the full year, Scores revenues were $654 million, up 24% from last year. As Will previewed, we have merged our Applications and Decision Management segments into a new Software segment. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $166 million, down 25% versus the same period last year. Full year Software revenues were $662 million, down 14% from the previous year. This quarterly and full year decline was due to reduced upfront license revenue recognition, reduced professional services revenue and the divestitures of our Collection Recovery products. I will spend a few minutes discussing each of these 3 factors and their impact on FY '21 results. At the start of fiscal 2021, we shifted the timing of revenue recognition for on-premise term license subscription deals. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term of each contract. The net impact was lower license revenue in our Software segment of about $12 million in Q4 and about $34 million for the full year versus what it would have been under our prior sales model. To help show the impact of upfront revenue recognition of on-prem term license software sales, we have added a new table in the 10-K that breaks out our on-premise and SaaS software revenue into revenue recognized at a point in time versus revenue recognized over the contract term. Turning to professional services. We have previously explained how we are deemphasizing low-margin nonstrategic services engagement. As expected, this has resulted in lower PS revenues. Our PS revenues were down 35% in Q4 compared to the prior year quarter and 20% for the full year. Professional services continued to be an important part of our business, helping our customers implement our software and realize the most value from it over time. We expect to see additional modest declines in our services revenues over the next few quarters, after which we expect it to return to a growth trajectory in line with our on-premise and SaaS revenues. The third factor negatively impacting reported revenues this period was the divestiture of the Collections and Recovery product line in June as well as the sale earlier in the year of our Enterprise Security Score and the sale of certain assets to a joint venture we established in China. To help understand the impact of these divestitures, we have added additional details to the financial highlights presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. In that presentation, you will find reconciliations of our revenue in prior periods excluding these divestitures. This quarter, 81% of our total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 5% was from Asia Pacific. The Americas region, which we will use in our financials going forward, is simply a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. We mentioned in our call last quarter that we are planning -- that we were planning to introduce a number of new financial metrics for our Software segment. We are pleased to introduce those metrics this quarter. You will find a full description of these new metrics in the 10-K and on Page 8 of our financial highlights presentation. Let me take a few minutes to briefly walk you through each new metric. The first of these is annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which measures the underlying performance of our subscription-based software contracts. ARR is defined as the annualized revenue run rate of on-premise and SaaS software agreements within a quarterly reporting period. And as such, it is different from the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any given period. All components of our software licensing and subscription arrangements that are not expected to recur, primarily perpetual licenses, are excluded. We calculate ARR as the quarterly recurring revenue run rate multiplied by 4. Second new metric is annual contract value, or ACV, bookings. This replaces our previously disclosed bookings metric, which was based on total contract value, including the value of professional services. ACV bookings is the average annualized value of software contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future on-premise and SaaS software revenue. We only include contracts with an initial term of at least 24 months, and we exclude perpetual licenses and other revenues that are nonrecurring in nature. We also exclude the value of professional services sales. For renewals of existing software subscription contracts, we count only incremental annual revenue expected over the current contract as ACV bookings. The third new metric is dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, a measure of our success in retaining and growing revenue from our existing customers. To calculate dollar-based net retention rate for any period, we compare the ARR at the end of the prior comparable period, we call it the base ARR, to the ARR from that same cohort of customers at the end of the current quarter, retained ARR. Then we divide the retained ARR by the base ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our calculation includes the positive impact among this cohort of customers of selling additional products, price increases and increases in usage fees and the negative impact of customer attrition, price decreases and decreases in usage-based fees during the period. It is important to note that our disclosed ARR, dollar-based net retention rate and ACV bookings numbers for the current quarter and all prior quarters exclude revenues and bookings from our divested assets to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful. Fourth, as mentioned briefly above, we are disclosing the amount of our Software segment revenue that is recognized at a point in time versus recognized over the contract term. This helps provide an understanding of a key factor that drives the differences between reported Software revenue and ARR from period to period. And finally, we are breaking out our on-premise and SaaS software revenues, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate into platform and non-platform components. The shift of our software solutions and capabilities to the FICO platform is our #1 strategic goal in the Software segment. This new disclosure provides significant additional visibility into our progress. Taken together, we believe these metrics significantly enhance investor visibility into our Software segment. Specifically, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate show how we are retaining and growing our subscription-based customer relationships. And our platform disclosure shows the size, growth and expansion potential of the FICO platform. Now let me give you a few highlights on what these new metrics show this quarter. Our Software ARR in the fourth quarter was $524 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Our platform ARR was $75 million, representing 14% of our total fourth quarter ARR and a growth rate of 58% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $449 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106% overall, while our non-platform customers' software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable with retention hovering around 100%. Our platform customers are showing very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the fourth quarter, up from 116% in the prior year. Excluding divested product lines and businesses, our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $25.8 million versus $28.9 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $62.8 million versus $58.3 million in FY '20, representing growth of about 8% year-over-year. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $219 million this quarter. This included an $8 million restructuring charge primarily associated with reductions in our professional services delivery staff and rationalization of resources following our Collections and Recovery divestiture. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 45% for the quarter and 40% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 600 basis points for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $86 million, up 45% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter, up 15% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $392 million, which included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. Non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 17%, including $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% for the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $416 million, up 21% from last year's $343 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash on the balance sheet. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.26 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. In October, we amended our credit agreement to allow for the issuance of a $300 million term loan with our bank group, increasing our total bank capacity to $900 million. We used the proceeds of the term loan to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 845,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $446 per share. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased a total of 1,877,000 shares at an average price of $470 per share for a total of $882 million. At the end of September, we had about $173 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on fiscal '22.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As we move into fiscal '22, I believe we are well positioned for the year ahead. In our Software business, we continue to solidify and add functional capabilities to our platform. And we remain committed to becoming the preeminent provider of decisioning analytics. We are committed to pursuing growth opportunities and improving our efficiency. In our Scores business, we continue to innovate and find new ways to add value for our customers and benefit from the diversification that comes from the broad usage through the various credit verticals.  We entered the new year with more visibility than last year, and as such, are again providing guidance for fiscal '22, as shown on Page 15 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.35 billion, an increase of about 3% versus fiscal '21 on an as-reported basis and about 6% when adjusted for the divestitures. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $318 million, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.29, non-GAAP net income of $397 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $14.12. I'll turn the call back over to Steve, and then we'll take your questions.\nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will. This prepares our prepared -- this concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: You're guiding to Scores revenue growth up 6% next year. That excludes any special pricing increases. Could you talk about what the assumptions are and factors are that go into your 6% growth outlook?\nWilliam Lansing: It's a continuation. We break it down into the pieces. And we look at mortgage. We look at auto. We look at card. We look at prescreen. So we look at all the pieces and put estimates on that. We use industry forecasts to inform those estimates, although we're not always exactly on top, we form our own views. And that's basically how we do it. That's how we got to the 6%. I mean it's a combination of -- it combines both volume increases based on industry and price increases as well.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. So there is some measure of underlying pricing increase in there?\nWilliam Lansing: Yes. Just to be clear, it's CPI kinds of increases.\nMichael McLaughlin: Not including the strategic price increases.\nWilliam Lansing: Right.\nMichael McLaughlin: And George, I would add to that. I just -- sorry to interrupt, just looking across those segments, we do our best to predict volumes for the 3 major parts of our B2B business. Just like you probably do. We don't have a crystal ball. But I can say that our expectations for mortgage are in line with what you would find from third-party forecasters. And likewise, we expect modest but positive growth in the auto and credit card and other segments.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Yes. That's helpful. That was the extra color I was hoping to get. And then with the extra Software disclosures, I guess if we dive into ARR performance, the percentage of ARR that's on platforms at 14%, it's nearly double what it was about 2 years ago. What are your expectations for how that continues to tick higher? What's embedded in your 2022 guide? And how would you expect that trajectory to just perform in the years ahead?\nWilliam Lansing: We see the platform side of ARR growing at over 50%.\nMichael McLaughlin: And overall, if you just do the math on our guidance, the 6% total revenue growth is approximately equal in terms of percentage between the Software and Scores business. So if you expect very strong continued growth in the platform business, we think our platform is going to be relatively flat.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. So 50% is a good run rate growth to apply to the platform piece.\nMichael McLaughlin: That's right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: As a follow-up to the ARR question and more specifically the net revenue retention rate of 143% for the platform, can you talk about the sales process and how that works for the client in terms of what the client initially buys and kind of what the upsell is and how the timing of the upsell works?\nWilliam Lansing: Sure. And obviously, it varies from client to client. Typically, we put the platform in with a specific number of use cases and very specific ideas about how the platform will be used and what problem is being solved. But increasingly, it's being put in with a view to being able to provide additional solutions later on. And what we're seeing -- a classic land-and-expand strategy. And what we're seeing is that's working with our current platform customers and what -- and the ones that have gone in less recently, we're seeing expansion. We're seeing new uses, new ways of using the platform, and so -- which is what's really informing that 143% retention rate.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then in terms of just bringing on new clients onto the platform, can you talk a little bit about the conversations you're having there and what it's kind of taking to get them across the finish line and the time lines generally involved?\nWilliam Lansing: The time line is a little bit longer than our historic 270-day sales cycle with our older applications. But the -- what's happening is it's a bigger deal at the client. It's being brought in as part of a broader strategy. It's being brought in with a view to using it to really interact with consumer customers strategically. And so it is a bigger, more complicated conversation, but it's -- we're kind of in the middle of it. We're right in the middle of the way our clients want to interact with our consumer customers. We're seeing ourselves pop up in their strategy presentations.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And just kind of a technical question on the accounting part of the ARR maybe. Is there a kind of a volume component to it in the sense that there's a head count of the number of people that are on there, all else equal, or usage?\nMichael McLaughlin: I'm not following the head count part of it. Are you talking about our contracts that are usage-based as opposed to based on minimums per year?\nSurinder Thind: Yes, the combination of minimums versus usage base. So let's say a use case has -- a lender has, I don't know, 10 million accounts or something like that as a use case or was part of that. And then obviously, that number can change. So are there kind of bands? Or how does that work? Just to understand what the volatility might be.\nMichael McLaughlin: Yes, it's a good question. So our contracts have both. Many have minimums. Many have usage components. Some have minimum with usage if you exceed a certain amount of volume or use cases or accounts. What we do is if it's minimums, that's what goes in the ARR unless and until that customer exceeds the minimums, and then that additional run rate is added to ARR in the period in which that occurs.  If it's a purely usage-based contract, some of our customer communication services contracts, for example, are based on the number of messages that are sent in cases where fraud is identified or what have you. There, we estimate once the solution has been installed and is running and has shown a stabilized usage rate, we then use that as the ARR that we will enter into the quarter's results. If that usage goes up or down in future quarters, we adjust ARR accordingly. Does that make sense?\nSurinder Thind: Yes. That's actually very helpful. That's it for me.\nOperator: Next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on the margins. Obviously, it came in really strong this quarter. I know there's been a lot of moving pieces with deemphasizing professional services and the C&R divestiture. But just wanted to get any thoughts on what your assumptions would be on like the sustainability of operating margins in line with what we saw this quarter.\nMichael McLaughlin: There isn't anything structural that has changed or we expect to change in the quarters ahead in fiscal '22 versus what you've seen in recent quarters other than the fact that we expect to return to traveling. So if you look at the expense breakdown in our supplemental materials, I think we spent $0.5 million on T&E in Q4. That's going to go back up to a more normal rate, or at least that's what we're projecting.  Professional services, as that declines, that's a low gross margin business, therefore, a high cost of goods sold business. So the cost of goods sold declines as those revenues go down. But otherwise, in terms of what we're investing in R&D and go-to-market and G&A, nothing dramatic has changed in our forecast versus our historical other than we've taken out a lot of expense from divestitures.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the B2C side. The performance continues to be really impressive for Scores. Is this something that you guys think you can keep growing kind of above trend? It seems like you guys are putting up significantly faster growth than what we're seeing with some of the other players in the space.\nWilliam Lansing: I think that there's a lot of strength in the FICO brand, and I think that there's a lot of strength in the operating and management acumen of our B2C team. So doing better than others, I think you could expect that. Will we be able to repeat year-over-year performance in the 30s? I can't promise that. I think we're more likely to be on something closer to our quarter-to-quarter growth.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nJohn Mazzoni: This is John Mazzoni filling in for Ashish. Maybe just a quick one on the B2B revenues. I know there was a onetime impact that if adjusted, that would be around 15%. How should we think about these moving forward, especially going into kind of the '22?\nWilliam Lansing: Those kinds of onetimers happen periodically. It is kind of part of the business. We do audits and true-ups every few years with different channel partners. And so can you expect them to continue? Yes, there will be things like that, that are a little bit unpredictable. But it is part of the business.\nJohn Mazzoni: Understood. And then maybe just a quick follow-up. How do you see the Software business evolving over time? Maybe of a longer-term perspective, just as we kind of wrap our heads around these new metrics, what could be a longer-term growth rate or any type of things that investors should be paying attention to?\nWilliam Lansing: Okay. With the caveat that this is not guidance, I would say look at our platform growth, 50% platform growth, which tells you that we have something there that the market wants. We have a large number -- a large number -- 19 enterprise customers, large customers who have adopted the platform and many more in the pipeline. And what we're seeing is that's a combination of conversion, substitution of platform solutions for more historical solutions, but it's also growth. It's also new stuff.  And so over time -- and it could be a very long time. But over time, you'll see our software transition from our older solutions to platform solutions and the platform solutions piece is growing a lot faster. So will our growth rate go up? Yes, it almost certainly will go up as we do more and more of our total Software business on the platform. So if today is 6%, I would just extrapolate out from 6% upward. And I don't know how many years it will take, but we will be in double digits eventually.\nOperator: And Mr. Weber, there are no further questions.\nSteven Weber: All right. Thank you all for joining today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes the call.\nOperator: And that will conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Michael McLaughlin",
            "content": "Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As you may have already seen in our 10-K and the financial highlights presentation posted to the FICO website, we have made significant enhancements to our financial reporting this quarter, including the introduction of new metrics in both our Scores and Software segments. We'll briefly preview these metrics, and I will take some extra time on this call to provide more details on what we are disclosing and what new insights these numbers provide. As Will said, we have a strong finish to our fiscal year, and we are well positioned as we enter fiscal 2022. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $335 million, a decrease of 11% over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in upfront recognition of term license revenues on-prem software sales, the sale of our Collections and Recovery product line in June and lower professional services revenue in our Software segment. Our full year revenue of $1.32 billion was up 2% over last year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $169 million, up 10% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 2% over the prior year. As you may recall, last year's fiscal fourth quarter included a onetime royalty true-up that did not recur this year. Adjusting for this onetime true-up, B2B revenue was up about 15% this quarter. B2C revenues were up 32% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and partner revenues grew significantly. One of the new financial metrics we are adding to our 10-K and 10-Q disclosures going forward is the breakdown of our Scores segment revenues between B2B and B2C components. For the full year, Scores revenues were $654 million, up 24% from last year. As Will previewed, we have merged our Applications and Decision Management segments into a new Software segment. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $166 million, down 25% versus the same period last year. Full year Software revenues were $662 million, down 14% from the previous year. This quarterly and full year decline was due to reduced upfront license revenue recognition, reduced professional services revenue and the divestitures of our Collection Recovery products. I will spend a few minutes discussing each of these 3 factors and their impact on FY '21 results. At the start of fiscal 2021, we shifted the timing of revenue recognition for on-premise term license subscription deals. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term of each contract. The net impact was lower license revenue in our Software segment of about $12 million in Q4 and about $34 million for the full year versus what it would have been under our prior sales model. To help show the impact of upfront revenue recognition of on-prem term license software sales, we have added a new table in the 10-K that breaks out our on-premise and SaaS software revenue into revenue recognized at a point in time versus revenue recognized over the contract term. Turning to professional services. We have previously explained how we are deemphasizing low-margin nonstrategic services engagement. As expected, this has resulted in lower PS revenues. Our PS revenues were down 35% in Q4 compared to the prior year quarter and 20% for the full year. Professional services continued to be an important part of our business, helping our customers implement our software and realize the most value from it over time. We expect to see additional modest declines in our services revenues over the next few quarters, after which we expect it to return to a growth trajectory in line with our on-premise and SaaS revenues. The third factor negatively impacting reported revenues this period was the divestiture of the Collections and Recovery product line in June as well as the sale earlier in the year of our Enterprise Security Score and the sale of certain assets to a joint venture we established in China. To help understand the impact of these divestitures, we have added additional details to the financial highlights presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. In that presentation, you will find reconciliations of our revenue in prior periods excluding these divestitures. This quarter, 81% of our total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 14%, and the remaining 5% was from Asia Pacific. The Americas region, which we will use in our financials going forward, is simply a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. We mentioned in our call last quarter that we are planning -- that we were planning to introduce a number of new financial metrics for our Software segment. We are pleased to introduce those metrics this quarter. You will find a full description of these new metrics in the 10-K and on Page 8 of our financial highlights presentation. Let me take a few minutes to briefly walk you through each new metric. The first of these is annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which measures the underlying performance of our subscription-based software contracts. ARR is defined as the annualized revenue run rate of on-premise and SaaS software agreements within a quarterly reporting period. And as such, it is different from the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any given period. All components of our software licensing and subscription arrangements that are not expected to recur, primarily perpetual licenses, are excluded. We calculate ARR as the quarterly recurring revenue run rate multiplied by 4. Second new metric is annual contract value, or ACV, bookings. This replaces our previously disclosed bookings metric, which was based on total contract value, including the value of professional services. ACV bookings is the average annualized value of software contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future on-premise and SaaS software revenue. We only include contracts with an initial term of at least 24 months, and we exclude perpetual licenses and other revenues that are nonrecurring in nature. We also exclude the value of professional services sales. For renewals of existing software subscription contracts, we count only incremental annual revenue expected over the current contract as ACV bookings. The third new metric is dollar-based net retention rate, or DBNRR, a measure of our success in retaining and growing revenue from our existing customers. To calculate dollar-based net retention rate for any period, we compare the ARR at the end of the prior comparable period, we call it the base ARR, to the ARR from that same cohort of customers at the end of the current quarter, retained ARR. Then we divide the retained ARR by the base ARR to arrive at the dollar-based net retention rate. Our calculation includes the positive impact among this cohort of customers of selling additional products, price increases and increases in usage fees and the negative impact of customer attrition, price decreases and decreases in usage-based fees during the period. It is important to note that our disclosed ARR, dollar-based net retention rate and ACV bookings numbers for the current quarter and all prior quarters exclude revenues and bookings from our divested assets to make period-to-period comparisons more meaningful. Fourth, as mentioned briefly above, we are disclosing the amount of our Software segment revenue that is recognized at a point in time versus recognized over the contract term. This helps provide an understanding of a key factor that drives the differences between reported Software revenue and ARR from period to period. And finally, we are breaking out our on-premise and SaaS software revenues, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate into platform and non-platform components. The shift of our software solutions and capabilities to the FICO platform is our #1 strategic goal in the Software segment. This new disclosure provides significant additional visibility into our progress. Taken together, we believe these metrics significantly enhance investor visibility into our Software segment. Specifically, ARR and dollar-based net retention rate show how we are retaining and growing our subscription-based customer relationships. And our platform disclosure shows the size, growth and expansion potential of the FICO platform. Now let me give you a few highlights on what these new metrics show this quarter. Our Software ARR in the fourth quarter was $524 million, a 7% increase over the prior year. Our platform ARR was $75 million, representing 14% of our total fourth quarter ARR and a growth rate of 58% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $449 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106% overall, while our non-platform customers' software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable with retention hovering around 100%. Our platform customers are showing very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the fourth quarter, up from 116% in the prior year. Excluding divested product lines and businesses, our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $25.8 million versus $28.9 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $62.8 million versus $58.3 million in FY '20, representing growth of about 8% year-over-year. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $219 million this quarter. This included an $8 million restructuring charge primarily associated with reductions in our professional services delivery staff and rationalization of resources following our Collections and Recovery divestiture. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 45% for the quarter and 40% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 600 basis points for the full year. GAAP net income this quarter was $86 million, up 45% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter, up 15% from the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $392 million, which included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. Non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 17%, including $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% for the year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $90 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $416 million, up 21% from last year's $343 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash on the balance sheet. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.26 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.3%. In October, we amended our credit agreement to allow for the issuance of a $300 million term loan with our bank group, increasing our total bank capacity to $900 million. We used the proceeds of the term loan to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 845,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $446 per share. In fiscal 2021, we repurchased a total of 1,877,000 shares at an average price of $470 per share for a total of $882 million. At the end of September, we had about $173 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on fiscal '22. Not including the strategic price increases. And George, I would add to that. I just -- sorry to interrupt, just looking across those segments, we do our best to predict volumes for the 3 major parts of our B2B business. Just like you probably do. We don't have a crystal ball. But I can say that our expectations for mortgage are in line with what you would find from third-party forecasters. And likewise, we expect modest but positive growth in the auto and credit card and other segments. And overall, if you just do the math on our guidance, the 6% total revenue growth is approximately equal in terms of percentage between the Software and Scores business. So if you expect very strong continued growth in the platform business, we think our platform is going to be relatively flat. That's right. I'm not following the head count part of it. Are you talking about our contracts that are usage-based as opposed to based on minimums per year? Yes, it's a good question. So our contracts have both. Many have minimums. Many have usage components. Some have minimum with usage if you exceed a certain amount of volume or use cases or accounts. What we do is if it's minimums, that's what goes in the ARR unless and until that customer exceeds the minimums, and then that additional run rate is added to ARR in the period in which that occurs.  If it's a purely usage-based contract, some of our customer communication services contracts, for example, are based on the number of messages that are sent in cases where fraud is identified or what have you. There, we estimate once the solution has been installed and is running and has shown a stabilized usage rate, we then use that as the ARR that we will enter into the quarter's results. If that usage goes up or down in future quarters, we adjust ARR accordingly. Does that make sense? There isn't anything structural that has changed or we expect to change in the quarters ahead in fiscal '22 versus what you've seen in recent quarters other than the fact that we expect to return to traveling. So if you look at the expense breakdown in our supplemental materials, I think we spent $0.5 million on T&E in Q4. That's going to go back up to a more normal rate, or at least that's what we're projecting.  Professional services, as that declines, that's a low gross margin business, therefore, a high cost of goods sold business. So the cost of goods sold declines as those revenues go down. But otherwise, in terms of what we're investing in R&D and go-to-market and G&A, nothing dramatic has changed in our forecast versus our historical other than we've taken out a lot of expense from divestitures."

            "name": "William Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that our Q4 capped another terrific year, a year in which we posted record revenues, earnings and cash flows. And we were able to do this despite headwinds in fiscal '21 due to a shift in the timing of revenue recognition for term license subscription sales and the sale of 2 product lines in our software business and the managed and deliberate decline in our software and professional services revenues. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $335 million in Q4 and $1.32 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We were able to grow our full year revenue despite these negative revenue factors. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $392 million of GAAP net income and $13.40 of earnings per share, which includes the gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million, up 15%. And earnings per share of $3.92 was up 21% from the prior quarter -- prior year quarter. Full year non-GAAP net income was $383 million, up 31% over last year. And non-GAAP EPS of $13.07 was up 34% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $90 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $416 million, up 21% from the previous year. In fiscal 2021, we continued our commitment to shareholder return, buying back $882 million of stock during the year. We increased our leverage by about $425 million compared to year-end fiscal '20, but our adjusted leverage ratio remains a modest 2.07x. We view FICO shares as the best use of our excess cash at this time and expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares in the coming year. We had another solid year and making steady progress on our strategic initiatives. In our Scores segment, our diversification of verticals has enabled us to continue to drive growth even as various sectors slow down. Scores were up 10% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 24% for the full year, as you can see on Page 7 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 2% in the quarter versus the prior year, which had a onetime royalty true-up. Adjusting for that, revenues were up about 15% for the quarter and 21% for the full year. As expected, we saw a slowdown in mortgage origination volumes, and revenues were down about 18% year-over-year. Auto origination revenues were up 19%, and card and personal loan origination revenues were up 45%. We are seeing particular strength in the card and personal loan space from our customers, including fintechs. The year-over-year pricing increases we implemented in fiscal '21 also had a positive impact on overall B2B revenues. Our B2C revenues were up 32% versus the prior year quarter and 42% for the full year compared to 2020. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO.com products as well as through our partner channels. In next year's guidance, which I'll discuss in greater detail later, we expect the Scores business to grow about 6%. There's been no change in our strategy or approach to special pricing. Accordingly, special pricing increases consistent with the past several years are not included in this guidance. While we expect these price increases to have an impact consistent with those over the last several years, because it's difficult to estimate the timing and the magnitude of the impact, we remain conservative in how we issue our guidance relative to such increases. Turning to our Software business. As we have mentioned in recent quarters, we have been developing new financial metrics that provide more visibility into the recurring revenue generated by our subscription-based SaaS and on-prem software and the retention and growth of our existing software customers. Beginning this quarter, we are pleased to unveil our revised software reporting structure and these new metrics. Mike McLaughlin will go into much more detail in his remarks, but let me give you just a few highlights.  First, we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how we assess performance and allocate resources. We merged our legacy Applications and Decision Management Software segments into a single Software segment. We continue to report the Scores segment, which is unchanged from past reporting. We also changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance, professional services and license to on-premises and SaaS software, professional services and Scores to better align with our business strategy and peer reporting practices.  You'll also find in our 10-K this year our first reporting of annual recurring revenue, or ARR, which provides visibility into the growth trajectory of our Software business without the variability that comes with the upfront revenue recognition required by ASC 606 for on-prem subscription sales. We are also disclosing dollar-based net retention rate and annual contract value of software bookings. Another big change we'll be talking about is the split of our Software revenue between our on-platform and off-platform products. We'll give those splits for revenue, for ARR and for dollar-based net retention revenue. We believe it's important to focus on the progress of our on-platform offerings as it's the central strategy of our Software business. As in prior years, we will continue to focus on investing in our software platform. In fiscal '21, we divested assets that could not be easily migrated to the platform and reallocated resources to accelerate platform development and our go-to-market efforts. By allocating the resources strategically and efficiently, we expect to spur growth and achieve scale while effectively managing our operating expenses. I'm happy with the progress we made in 2021, and I'm optimistic about what lies ahead in 2022 and beyond. We'll continue to allocate our resources to areas of high strategic importance, and we'll continue to focus on long-term shareholder value.  I'll have some final comments in a moment, provide our fiscal '22 guidance then. But first, let me just turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thanks, Mike. As we move into fiscal '22, I believe we are well positioned for the year ahead. In our Software business, we continue to solidify and add functional capabilities to our platform. And we remain committed to becoming the preeminent provider of decisioning analytics. We are committed to pursuing growth opportunities and improving our efficiency. In our Scores business, we continue to innovate and find new ways to add value for our customers and benefit from the diversification that comes from the broad usage through the various credit verticals.  We entered the new year with more visibility than last year, and as such, are again providing guidance for fiscal '22, as shown on Page 15 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.35 billion, an increase of about 3% versus fiscal '21 on an as-reported basis and about 6% when adjusted for the divestitures. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $318 million, GAAP earnings per share of approximately $11.29, non-GAAP net income of $397 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $14.12. I'll turn the call back over to Steve, and then we'll take your questions. It's a continuation. We break it down into the pieces. And we look at mortgage. We look at auto. We look at card. We look at prescreen. So we look at all the pieces and put estimates on that. We use industry forecasts to inform those estimates, although we're not always exactly on top, we form our own views. And that's basically how we do it. That's how we got to the 6%. I mean it's a combination of -- it combines both volume increases based on industry and price increases as well. Yes. Just to be clear, it's CPI kinds of increases. Right. We see the platform side of ARR growing at over 50%. Sure. And obviously, it varies from client to client. Typically, we put the platform in with a specific number of use cases and very specific ideas about how the platform will be used and what problem is being solved. But increasingly, it's being put in with a view to being able to provide additional solutions later on. And what we're seeing -- a classic land-and-expand strategy. And what we're seeing is that's working with our current platform customers and what -- and the ones that have gone in less recently, we're seeing expansion. We're seeing new uses, new ways of using the platform, and so -- which is what's really informing that 143% retention rate. The time line is a little bit longer than our historic 270-day sales cycle with our older applications. But the -- what's happening is it's a bigger deal at the client. It's being brought in as part of a broader strategy. It's being brought in with a view to using it to really interact with consumer customers strategically. And so it is a bigger, more complicated conversation, but it's -- we're kind of in the middle of it. We're right in the middle of the way our clients want to interact with our consumer customers. We're seeing ourselves pop up in their strategy presentations. I think that there's a lot of strength in the FICO brand, and I think that there's a lot of strength in the operating and management acumen of our B2C team. So doing better than others, I think you could expect that. Will we be able to repeat year-over-year performance in the 30s? I can't promise that. I think we're more likely to be on something closer to our quarter-to-quarter growth. Those kinds of onetimers happen periodically. It is kind of part of the business. We do audits and true-ups every few years with different channel partners. And so can you expect them to continue? Yes, there will be things like that, that are a little bit unpredictable. But it is part of the business. Okay. With the caveat that this is not guidance, I would say look at our platform growth, 50% platform growth, which tells you that we have something there that the market wants. We have a large number -- a large number -- 19 enterprise customers, large customers who have adopted the platform and many more in the pipeline. And what we're seeing is that's a combination of conversion, substitution of platform solutions for more historical solutions, but it's also growth. It's also new stuff.  And so over time -- and it could be a very long time. But over time, you'll see our software transition from our older solutions to platform solutions and the platform solutions piece is growing a lot faster. So will our growth rate go up? Yes, it almost certainly will go up as we do more and more of our total Software business on the platform. So if today is 6%, I would just extrapolate out from 6% upward. And I don't know how many years it will take, but we will be in double digits eventually."

A replay of this webcast will be available through August 3, 2022. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing : Thanks Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank our FICO colleagues for their dedication, adaptability, and innovation during this past year. As we begin to open our offices back up, we're moving to a hybrid system where more of our team is working from home, but we've proven in the past year that we can make the most of technology to collaborate and continue to serve our customers and optimize our business, both remotely and in person.  On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our third quarter.  In our third quarter we delivered revenues of $338 million an increase of 8% over the same period last year. As previously disclosed, we completed the divestiture of our debt collections and recovery products during the quarter. Adjusting for that, revenue grew about 9% year-over-year.  We delivered $151 million dollars of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, including the gain on sale of the C&R products. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the sale, net income was $99 million, up 29% and earnings per share of $3.38 was up 31% from last year.  We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Free cash flow was $99 million in the quarter and $462 million for the last four quarters, and we're dedicated to using that cash flow return value to our shareholders, through our repurchase program. It was a very strong quarter for us, and we are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year.  As we continue our strategy of migrating our business model towards a subscription based model, we see some disruption in our near term numbers. We're not recognizing as much revenue upfront and not selling and delivering as much lower margin services revenue. So, these efforts are positioning the company for long term predictable and profitable growth.  Beginning next quarter we will be providing additional metrics that will give additional transparency to our business. Metrics like ARR will complement our revenue reporting and provide a better indicator of our growth trajectory. We'll also be talking about the different delivery vehicles for our software, specifically whether the products are delivered on platform or off platform.  The Decision Management platform is the linchpin to our software strategic vision and bringing new customers onto that platform will enable us to scale the business and realize its full potential. As I've stated, we believe we can become the pre-eminent player in decisioning analytics; that is our singular role in our software business.  On the Score side we remain committed to innovation while maintaining the predictability that has always been the cornerstone of the FICO score, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to drive outstanding growth in our Score\u2019s business. Score\u2019s posted another record quarter, up 31% versus the prior year.  On the B2B side revenues were up 23%. Mortgage originations as predicted in the marketplace appear to have peaked and were flat with last year's numbers. It is now a year since the refi boom began and we expect those numbers to trend down as the market returns to more normal levels.  Auto originations continue to be strong with those revenues up more than 30% year-over-year. The most dramatic growth came from credit cards and other unsecured lending products. We had a record revenue quarter in card originations, with revenues up more than 50% from last year. We saw acceleration in card origination activity throughout the quarter and expect that activity to continue to be strong.  Fee screen volumes were up more than 150% versus last year. This is typically a leading indicator for new card origination activity, and shows the financial institutions have a strong appetite to market and originate new accounts in the unsecured market. We believe banks are in a very strong financial position to pivot to other lending products as mortgage demand wins as expected by the industry.  On the consumer side we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 50% versus the same quarter last year. That growth at myfico.com while still strong is slowing, which we expected as the mortgage market cools off. Growth among our partners has picked up as Experian and others find new ways to serve an increasingly sophisticated consumer.  Finally, this quarter we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Mike will review the financial impacts and talk about how we are using the proceeds for share repurchases. As we said last quarter, the divestiture further focuses our resources on refining and distributing the best-in-class decision platform that we believe is an incredible opportunity for FICO.  I\u2019ll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. \nMike McLaughlin : Thanks Will and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our third quarter results in more detail and provide some information on divestiture of the collections and recovery products we closed in quarter.  Total FICO revenue for the quarter was $338 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications segment revenues were $133 million up 3% sequentially and down 6% versus the same period last year.  Adjusting for the C&R divestiture, applications revenues were up 6% versus last quarter and down 4% from last year. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily driven by reduced professional services revenues.  In our decision management software segment, Q3 revenues were $33 million, down 20% over the same period last year, due primarily to decreased upfront license revenues. As Will said, our shifting business model is continuing to impact our software business in the near term. Our on premise license revenues will continue to decline as we move away from license sales to a notable subscription revenue model.  Second, at the start of our fiscal year we noted that we have also changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on premise term license subscription deal. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term at each deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue in our applications and DMS segments, of about $4 million versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be about $40 million and lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods.  As a reminder, last year we booked $61 million in upfront license revenue and our fiscal fourth quarter under the prior methodology. So that will be an especially difficult year-over-year comparison.  As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing does not have an impact on free cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. I'd also like to remind you that we are deemphasizing low margin, non-strategic professional services engagements, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenue. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value software with decline revenue. This quarter services revenues were down 18% versus last year.  As Will said, we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line in the third quarter. We recognized a pre-tax book gain of $93 million in the third quarter. The sale contributed $2.52 of after tax EPS to the quarter's GAAP results. Proceeds from the sale were used to fund a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program.  Turning to our Scores segment, total revenues were $172 million up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 23% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes in credit card and auto originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different score categories. B2C scores revenues were up 50% from the same period line year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 6% was from the Asia Pacific region.  Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues continued to grow and were $67 million for the quarter, up 10% from the previous year.  Q3 bookings totaled $75 million, down 29% from the previous year and had an average weighted term of 30 months. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 12% yield. Much of the decline in bookings was due to our de-emphasize of low margin professional services, and the shorter term lengths of deals signed. Professional Services bookings totaled 21% down 50% from last year.  We continued to see a strong pipeline in our software business, and typically we have our strongest period for new deals in our fiscal fourth quarter. As we have said, we expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de-emphasis of professional service sales and the somewhat shorter term length of typical subscription and on-prem term license contracts.  As Will mentioned, we plan to begin providing more subscription software financial metrics next quarter, and we believe that the additional transparency will lead to better understanding of the results of the company, particularly in the software segment.  Our operating expenses totaled $144 million dollars this quarter, which included the $93 million dollars gain on the C&R sale, compared to $230 million in the prior quarter. Excluding that one-time gain, expenses were up $7 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. Compared to Q3 2020, operating expenses, excluding the one-time gain were up $6 million. We do expect to continue to increase in Q4 as we gradually add strategic headcount to drive our decision management platform development and distribution and increase customer related travel.  Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 500 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $151 million, which included $93 million of pre-tax gain from the divestiture. Our non GAAP net income was $99 million for the quarter, up 29% from the same quarter last year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27 % and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%, including the impact of the divestiture of our collections and recovery business.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million flat with the same period last year. For the trailing four quarter's, free cash flow was $462 million. At the end of the quarter we had $238 million in cash, up $40 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at just over $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.64%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 489,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $466 per share. This includes a $200 million accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into following the close of the C&R divestiture. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 we repurchased 1.31 million shares. At the end of June we had about $225 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts. \nWill Lansing: Thanks Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to manage our business and serve our customers in the midst of all this uncertainty created by the pandemic. We continue to prove that the FICO business model was strong. Our customers rely on our Mission Critical software, scores and other analytics to manage risk and optimize interactions with consumers. We continue to invest and innovate to provide state art solutions for customers looking use analytics to make better decisions.  I'll turn the call back over to Steve now for Q&A. \nSteve Weber: Thanks Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks. Operator, if you'd like to open the lines, we are now ready to take your questions. \nOperator: Certainly and thank you very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. I\u2019d like to start with the question about just the adoption of a competitor score by a large car issuer that's recently revealed I guess. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive marketplace at this point in terms of just how you think about the FICO 10 suites and maybe kind of if there's anything unique that prompted the issuer to switch from using FICO. \nWill Lansing: Yeah, the short answer is, without getting into all kinds of details, that was a special situation I think. That score has been around for a long time and our score is very strong and continue to stand the tests in the marketplace of being desirable. We believe our scores are the most predictive out there for what they are used for. And our business in Scores is as strong as it has ever been; our volumes are very strong. We have not seen a decline, and we don't see major issuers switching away. So I guess the best way to characterize that is a one-off and I think that's really it.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then in terms of just, when I think about the Scores business broadly and especially the strength that we're seeing in B2C, is there any additional color that you can provide in terms of the framework for how we should be thinking about the growth of that business. It is seeing if we were to rewind to last year, I think the thesis was that you know there\u2019s a lot of people that were concerned with their credit scores and so there's a kind of a rush to kind of do credit monitoring on a personal basis.  But now that the pandemic has resided [ph] I guess it \u2013 we're further through that process. Can you talk about the resiliency of that business and maybe are there additional factors that are now driving the growth? When I think about it on a sequential basis, the growth was still very impressive. \nWill Lansing: Yes, I think that there's some offsetting trends here, so the one trend that we worry about \u2013 we don't worry about it, but we recognize is that mortgage was super high over this last year and we can't expect it to continue at the same levels, and that's what all of our market analysts predict and we don't see any reason to disagree with that. And it is true that when consumers go shopping for mortgage, they often go to credit score monitoring to get a sense for what they are able to get by way of mortgage and pricing. So that's a positive factor that won't be as present going forward, at least until the next cycle.  Offsetting that I think is a level of awareness on the consumer part of the importance of credit scores, which has just been on a steady upward trajectory for a very long time, certainly the last five years. And as I've shared with you in the past, you know 10 years ago the FICO score aided awareness was about 30% in the U.S. and today its over 90% and most consumers are well aware of how important the FICO score is and continue to try to monitor it. So we see that as a positive and a positive that will continue.  And then finally our partners who provide credit report monitoring, credit score monitoring services are increasingly sophisticated in the way they get the message out and what they provide to their consumer customers, and they are doing very well and we encourage that. So, we feel pretty good about the business. \nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then maybe one other quick one. It sounds like auto and credit card volumes were an important contributor to the B2B part of the growth story. Can you talk about maybe where we might be in terms of how close are we to pre-pandemic levels within like the credit card segment at this point? I feel like there's a good visibility into auto volumes, mortgage volumes, which is kind of the third leg of that story. \nWill Lansing: Mike, I don't know if you have any detail on that that we can share. \nMike McLaughlin: Yes, we need to be careful about that because of the nature of our relationships with the bureaus of course, but it feels as though there's definitely still room to grow. They have rebounded smartly and we can see that in our results, but we're not in the business of predicting credit card volumes as you can understand, but what we can see looking backwards, which is all we can do, is it\u2019s still growing and doesn't appear to be plateauing. \nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hey! Good afternoon. This is actually [Inaudible] for Kyle today. I was wondering if you guys could provide a little more color around the pricing environment for the Score business. Did that last round of pricing changes have any noticeable impact on the Scores business this quarter? Thanks. \nWill Lansing: Yes, I would say not dramatic differences, not dramatic changes, not dramatic impacts from that. \nUnidentified Analyst: Got it, that's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, how should we think about the expense and margin trajectory of the business moving forward after that recent divestiture there? \nWill Lansing: I wouldn't expect tremendous changes. I mean there's some benefit that comes from de-emphasizing lower margin professional services as we talked about, so there's a benefit there, but at the same time, you've heard us talk about the opportunity in the platform space and the tremendous amount of R&D that we're pouring into it. And so I think there's focus on cost and expense control on the one hand, but at the same time our investment levels are high. So I think those offset one another and I wouldn't look for tremendous margin improvement.  There's also and this is a much more modest effect, but there's also coming out of COVID there'll be more travel expense, that sort of thing. \nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, got it. Alright, thanks guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nGeorge Tong: Hi! Thanks. Good afternoon. Going back to the Scores business, revenue grew 31% in the quarter and you mentioned mortgages were relatively flat from a volume perspective, parts and autos strong. Can you at a high level discuss how much part and auto volumes grew by and how much pricing contributed to growth? \nWill Lansing: Well, I don't think we break that. That\u2019s something we\u2019ve kept to ourselves. Mike, you want to help me with that? \nMike McLaughlin: Yeah, well sure. There were some numbers in the script which we can revisit with you on the one-on-ones if you like. But as Will said in his previous answer, the story this quarter was about volumes on price. It's not that there was no impact of price, but it was the lion's share for sure about volume in the segments we\u2019ve discussed. \nGeorge Tong: Okay, Got it. And then I'd like to dive a little bit more into your on platform strategy. Can you talk about evidence that you're seeing increasing customer adoption of your on-platform solutions and what initiatives you have to further drive client adoption of your on platform products? \nWill Lansing: Yes, absolutely! So all of our major \u2013 if you think about our major franchises, customer management, [inaudible] the triad franchise which goes to line increases and judgments about how and what to do with customers, existing customers and our other franchises that we are increasingly putting those solutions on top of the platform, so we're selling our software in a couple of ways.  One is, where the customer is after a solution and they happen to get that solution on top of the platform or they will, but they are still accurate particular solution. But increasingly what we're seeing is major financial institutions saying, we want to standardize on the platform, and we want to do not two or three or four solutions. We have an intent to do 10 or 15 or 20 solutions on top of this platform.  We want to leverage all of our data across all the different places where it resides and apply analytics and do it in a unified way, so we leverage everything that we have to make decisions with respect to customers and that's very much the future of our \u2013 that\u2019s our platform strategy and that's our future as doing that.  We have \u2013 it's a lumpy business. So we've landed a number of big customers over the last 12 months for the platform for this very purpose with an intent to start with five or 10 or 15 use cases and then expand beyond that. So we're pretty happy that the solution is meeting the need in the marketplace. The platform strategy has legs and it seems to be working.  That said, we have a lot of work left to do. Not all of our solutions are completely reported to the platform and the platform isn't as modular as we wish it were, we're working on that. So there's definitely plenty of investments still going in. But from a customer reception standpoint, we have medium and large financial institutions who have adopted it. \nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering if it's possible to quantify how we should think about the impact from the C&R divestiture in the fourth quarter or a quarterly impact going forward? \nWill Lansing: Mike, you want to take that? \nMike McLaughlin: I can take that one. Yes, I'm happy to. We mentioned last quarter or perhaps it was in the press release when we announced the deal, that roughly it's 6% of our revenues and that's you know rounding to the nearest percentage. And expense are in the near term that we'll be able to flex in the same ballpark as those revenue numbers.  It's a Q4 heavy business just like our other software businesses are. So the year-over-year impact of not owning that business in Q4 in \u201921 would have some seasonality associated with it versus a [inaudible] respect, but what will give you a ball park of what to expect. \nAshish Sabadra: Okay. And then maybe just to follow-up on the earlier question around the software, I was wondering if you could talk about like the progress on the API, the external API strategy, as well as the studios. Any color there will be helpful? Thanks. \nWill Lansing: Yes, I would say both of those proceed to pace, and that we have \u2013 am I hearing this interference.  We are making progress on both the external facing APIs and on FICO Studio, there\u2019s more of that to come, but much of that will be ready this year. \nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks. \nOperator: The next question comes from Caroline Conway with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. \nCaroline Conway: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the expectations for applications going forward following the recent divestiture. Would you say that the business at this point is right sized, and can you talk about the strategic role of the business unit at this stage, particularly as it relates to the decision management business? \nWill Lansing: Yes, I guess I would say that it is right sized. We don't have any plans for any significant divestiture going forward, at least not at this time. So I would call it right sized. I think the way to think about it is that the application solutions will increasingly be available on top of the decision management platforms and you so [inaudible] bear with you how those things break out. But you know right sized, yes. \nCaroline Conway: Okay, thank you. And my other question is next quarter as your talking about the ARR and other metrics, are you expecting to provide additional detail on decision management profitability, especially the timing of turning to a profitable level? And will we see some guidance at that point as well on growth rates? \nWill Lansing: Will started with the revenue and I think we'll have the TBD on getting down to margin level. \nCaroline Conway: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Jeff Mueler with Baird. Your line is open. \nJeff Mueler: Yeah, thank you. Anything further you can say on bookings, it was the third quarter in a row of relatively weak bookings, and it sounds like the de-emphasis of professional services is a large part of that.  You also mentioned shorter term length, and I guess is that customers electing shorter terms or you and customers jointly preferring shorter terms because of how the subscription based software is sold or is that timing of large deal activity? Just how much of the weaker bookings is that? How much of it is other things? \nWill Lansing: The shorter term length is significant. It's \u2013 Mike can keep me honest, I think it\u2019s on the order of 25% reduction in term length, so it's significant. In terms of whose idea is that, we always do what the customer wants.  That said, if we had \u2013 to the extent that we have a choice in the matter, our preferences were shorter, because we do think that's a better way to go. We think that there are more opportunities for us to revisit things sooner if we go for the shorter term length.  So, and this is part of why we changed the way we compensate our sales force as well. We used to compensate on bookings and longer terms to commissions and we no longer do that. Our goal is to provide the term that our customer wants, but shorter is absolutely fine with us. \nMike McLaughlin: And Jeff, I can add a little bit of color to that. So the term length, the average term length was 37 months a year ago and it was 30 this time; that's about a 20% decrease, 19% to be specific. And if you apply the rough math, that's $15 million to $20 million of bookings right there, just because of term length. And the other factor is PS intensity. Our PS bookings were $20 million lower this quarter than they were last quarter. You see we are $30 million down in total bookings. So those two factors alone would, you know all else being equal explain that. \nJeff Mueler: Helpful. And then when you're giving the example of customers landing on the platform with a eventual intent to do 10 or 20 solutions, how many skews are there? Like how many solutions could a customer buy today if they bought everything or like where is that going? \nWill Lansing: Well, it's probably skews is not even the right way to think about it. Because when we think about skews we are, I don't know, call it 150 skews. But the platform in its modular form provides the opportunity to do hundreds and potentially thousands of combinations of things. And so I think, I think what we are moving to is more of a usage based pricing and a modular pricing that lets customers mix and match the components that they want, to achieve the goals that they want from a solution standpoint and so it's not like everything will be pre-packaged. \nJeff Mueler: Okay. And then last one for me, just on B2B scores, how do you maintain an ongoing dialogue with the ultimate end market enterprise customers. So, I think technically, it's your customer's customer because your Q and K disclosure is revenue concentration based on the bureau relationships. So how do you maintain that end-market dialogue and I guess monitor their commitment to staying on FICO scores. \nWill Lansing: Obviously, we stayed close to it through our channel partners, the bureaus. But we also certainly for all of the major institutions, we have direct sales relationships, and so any significant activity in one direction or another is well understood by our people and we are in a dialogue with them. \nJeff Mueler: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at present time. I\u2019ll turn the presentation back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks. Thank you. \nWill Lansing : Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining. This concludes today's call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks for joining. \nOperator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mike McLaughlin",
            "content": "Thanks Will and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our third quarter results in more detail and provide some information on divestiture of the collections and recovery products we closed in quarter.  Total FICO revenue for the quarter was $338 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications segment revenues were $133 million up 3% sequentially and down 6% versus the same period last year.  Adjusting for the C&R divestiture, applications revenues were up 6% versus last quarter and down 4% from last year. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily driven by reduced professional services revenues.  In our decision management software segment, Q3 revenues were $33 million, down 20% over the same period last year, due primarily to decreased upfront license revenues. As Will said, our shifting business model is continuing to impact our software business in the near term. Our on premise license revenues will continue to decline as we move away from license sales to a notable subscription revenue model.  Second, at the start of our fiscal year we noted that we have also changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on premise term license subscription deal. As a result, we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term at each deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue in our applications and DMS segments, of about $4 million versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be about $40 million and lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods.  As a reminder, last year we booked $61 million in upfront license revenue and our fiscal fourth quarter under the prior methodology. So that will be an especially difficult year-over-year comparison.  As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing does not have an impact on free cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. I'd also like to remind you that we are deemphasizing low margin, non-strategic professional services engagements, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenue. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value software with decline revenue. This quarter services revenues were down 18% versus last year.  As Will said, we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line in the third quarter. We recognized a pre-tax book gain of $93 million in the third quarter. The sale contributed $2.52 of after tax EPS to the quarter's GAAP results. Proceeds from the sale were used to fund a previously announced accelerated share repurchase program.  Turning to our Scores segment, total revenues were $172 million up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 23% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes in credit card and auto originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different score categories. B2C scores revenues were up 50% from the same period line year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and the remaining 6% was from the Asia Pacific region.  Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues continued to grow and were $67 million for the quarter, up 10% from the previous year.  Q3 bookings totaled $75 million, down 29% from the previous year and had an average weighted term of 30 months. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 12% yield. Much of the decline in bookings was due to our de-emphasize of low margin professional services, and the shorter term lengths of deals signed. Professional Services bookings totaled 21% down 50% from last year.  We continued to see a strong pipeline in our software business, and typically we have our strongest period for new deals in our fiscal fourth quarter. As we have said, we expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de-emphasis of professional service sales and the somewhat shorter term length of typical subscription and on-prem term license contracts.  As Will mentioned, we plan to begin providing more subscription software financial metrics next quarter, and we believe that the additional transparency will lead to better understanding of the results of the company, particularly in the software segment.  Our operating expenses totaled $144 million dollars this quarter, which included the $93 million dollars gain on the C&R sale, compared to $230 million in the prior quarter. Excluding that one-time gain, expenses were up $7 million, primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense. Compared to Q3 2020, operating expenses, excluding the one-time gain were up $6 million. We do expect to continue to increase in Q4 as we gradually add strategic headcount to drive our decision management platform development and distribution and increase customer related travel.  Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 500 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $151 million, which included $93 million of pre-tax gain from the divestiture. Our non GAAP net income was $99 million for the quarter, up 29% from the same quarter last year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20%. We expect our FY 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27 % and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%, including the impact of the divestiture of our collections and recovery business.  Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million flat with the same period last year. For the trailing four quarter's, free cash flow was $462 million. At the end of the quarter we had $238 million in cash, up $40 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at just over $1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.64%. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 489,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $466 per share. This includes a $200 million accelerated share repurchase agreement we entered into following the close of the C&R divestiture. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021 we repurchased 1.31 million shares. At the end of June we had about $225 million remaining on our stock repurchase authorization and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of our cash.  With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts. Yes, we need to be careful about that because of the nature of our relationships with the bureaus of course, but it feels as though there's definitely still room to grow. They have rebounded smartly and we can see that in our results, but we're not in the business of predicting credit card volumes as you can understand, but what we can see looking backwards, which is all we can do, is it's still growing and doesn't appear to be plateauing. Yeah, well sure. There were some numbers in the script which we can revisit with you on the one-on-ones if you like. But as Will said in his previous answer, the story this quarter was about volumes on price. It's not that there was no impact of price, but it was the lion's share for sure about volume in the segments we've discussed. I can take that one. Yes, I'm happy to. We mentioned last quarter or perhaps it was in the press release when we announced the deal, that roughly it's 6% of our revenues and that's you know rounding to the nearest percentage. And expense are in the near term that we'll be able to flex in the same ballpark as those revenue numbers.  It's a Q4 heavy business just like our other software businesses are. So the year-over-year impact of not owning that business in Q4 in '21 would have some seasonality associated with it versus a [inaudible] respect, but what will give you a ball park of what to expect. And Jeff, I can add a little bit of color to that. So the term length, the average term length was 37 months a year ago and it was 30 this time; that's about a 20% decrease, 19% to be specific. And if you apply the rough math, that's $15 million to $20 million of bookings right there, just because of term length. And the other factor is PS intensity. Our PS bookings were $20 million lower this quarter than they were last quarter. You see we are $30 million down in total bookings. So those two factors alone would, you know all else being equal explain that."

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks Steve, and thank you everyone for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. Before I discuss our results, I'd like to thank our FICO colleagues for their dedication, adaptability, and innovation during this past year. As we begin to open our offices back up, we're moving to a hybrid system where more of our team is working from home, but we've proven in the past year that we can make the most of technology to collaborate and continue to serve our customers and optimize our business, both remotely and in person.  On the Investor Relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our third quarter.  In our third quarter we delivered revenues of $338 million an increase of 8% over the same period last year. As previously disclosed, we completed the divestiture of our debt collections and recovery products during the quarter. Adjusting for that, revenue grew about 9% year-over-year.  We delivered $151 million dollars of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.18 per share, including the gain on sale of the C&R products. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the sale, net income was $99 million, up 29% and earnings per share of $3.38 was up 31% from last year.  We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Free cash flow was $99 million in the quarter and $462 million for the last four quarters, and we're dedicated to using that cash flow return value to our shareholders, through our repurchase program. It was a very strong quarter for us, and we are well positioned for a strong finish to our fiscal year.  As we continue our strategy of migrating our business model towards a subscription based model, we see some disruption in our near term numbers. We're not recognizing as much revenue upfront and not selling and delivering as much lower margin services revenue. So, these efforts are positioning the company for long term predictable and profitable growth.  Beginning next quarter we will be providing additional metrics that will give additional transparency to our business. Metrics like ARR will complement our revenue reporting and provide a better indicator of our growth trajectory. We'll also be talking about the different delivery vehicles for our software, specifically whether the products are delivered on platform or off platform.  The Decision Management platform is the linchpin to our software strategic vision and bringing new customers onto that platform will enable us to scale the business and realize its full potential. As I've stated, we believe we can become the pre-eminent player in decisioning analytics; that is our singular role in our software business.  On the Score side we remain committed to innovation while maintaining the predictability that has always been the cornerstone of the FICO score, and I'm pleased to report that we continue to drive outstanding growth in our Score's business. Score's posted another record quarter, up 31% versus the prior year.  On the B2B side revenues were up 23%. Mortgage originations as predicted in the marketplace appear to have peaked and were flat with last year's numbers. It is now a year since the refi boom began and we expect those numbers to trend down as the market returns to more normal levels.  Auto originations continue to be strong with those revenues up more than 30% year-over-year. The most dramatic growth came from credit cards and other unsecured lending products. We had a record revenue quarter in card originations, with revenues up more than 50% from last year. We saw acceleration in card origination activity throughout the quarter and expect that activity to continue to be strong.  Fee screen volumes were up more than 150% versus last year. This is typically a leading indicator for new card origination activity, and shows the financial institutions have a strong appetite to market and originate new accounts in the unsecured market. We believe banks are in a very strong financial position to pivot to other lending products as mortgage demand wins as expected by the industry.  On the consumer side we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 50% versus the same quarter last year. That growth at myfico.com while still strong is slowing, which we expected as the mortgage market cools off. Growth among our partners has picked up as Experian and others find new ways to serve an increasingly sophisticated consumer.  Finally, this quarter we closed the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Mike will review the financial impacts and talk about how we are using the proceeds for share repurchases. As we said last quarter, the divestiture further focuses our resources on refining and distributing the best-in-class decision platform that we believe is an incredible opportunity for FICO.  I'll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thanks Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to manage our business and serve our customers in the midst of all this uncertainty created by the pandemic. We continue to prove that the FICO business model was strong. Our customers rely on our Mission Critical software, scores and other analytics to manage risk and optimize interactions with consumers. We continue to invest and innovate to provide state art solutions for customers looking use analytics to make better decisions.  I'll turn the call back over to Steve now for Q&A. Yeah, the short answer is, without getting into all kinds of details, that was a special situation I think. That score has been around for a long time and our score is very strong and continue to stand the tests in the marketplace of being desirable. We believe our scores are the most predictive out there for what they are used for. And our business in Scores is as strong as it has ever been; our volumes are very strong. We have not seen a decline, and we don't see major issuers switching away. So I guess the best way to characterize that is a one-off and I think that's really it. Yes, I think that there's some offsetting trends here, so the one trend that we worry about \u2013 we don't worry about it, but we recognize is that mortgage was super high over this last year and we can't expect it to continue at the same levels, and that's what all of our market analysts predict and we don't see any reason to disagree with that. And it is true that when consumers go shopping for mortgage, they often go to credit score monitoring to get a sense for what they are able to get by way of mortgage and pricing. So that's a positive factor that won't be as present going forward, at least until the next cycle.  Offsetting that I think is a level of awareness on the consumer part of the importance of credit scores, which has just been on a steady upward trajectory for a very long time, certainly the last five years. And as I've shared with you in the past, you know 10 years ago the FICO score aided awareness was about 30% in the U.S. and today its over 90% and most consumers are well aware of how important the FICO score is and continue to try to monitor it. So we see that as a positive and a positive that will continue.  And then finally our partners who provide credit report monitoring, credit score monitoring services are increasingly sophisticated in the way they get the message out and what they provide to their consumer customers, and they are doing very well and we encourage that. So, we feel pretty good about the business. Mike, I don't know if you have any detail on that that we can share. Yes, I would say not dramatic differences, not dramatic changes, not dramatic impacts from that. I wouldn't expect tremendous changes. I mean there's some benefit that comes from de-emphasizing lower margin professional services as we talked about, so there's a benefit there, but at the same time, you've heard us talk about the opportunity in the platform space and the tremendous amount of R&D that we're pouring into it. And so I think there's focus on cost and expense control on the one hand, but at the same time our investment levels are high. So I think those offset one another and I wouldn't look for tremendous margin improvement.  There's also and this is a much more modest effect, but there's also coming out of COVID there'll be more travel expense, that sort of thing. Well, I don't think we break that. That's something we've kept to ourselves. Mike, you want to help me with that? Yes, absolutely! So all of our major \u2013 if you think about our major franchises, customer management, [inaudible] the triad franchise which goes to line increases and judgments about how and what to do with customers, existing customers and our other franchises that we are increasingly putting those solutions on top of the platform, so we're selling our software in a couple of ways.  One is, where the customer is after a solution and they happen to get that solution on top of the platform or they will, but they are still accurate particular solution. But increasingly what we're seeing is major financial institutions saying, we want to standardize on the platform, and we want to do not two or three or four solutions. We have an intent to do 10 or 15 or 20 solutions on top of this platform.  We want to leverage all of our data across all the different places where it resides and apply analytics and do it in a unified way, so we leverage everything that we have to make decisions with respect to customers and that's very much the future of our \u2013 that's our platform strategy and that's our future as doing that.  We have \u2013 it's a lumpy business. So we've landed a number of big customers over the last 12 months for the platform for this very purpose with an intent to start with five or 10 or 15 use cases and then expand beyond that. So we're pretty happy that the solution is meeting the need in the marketplace. The platform strategy has legs and it seems to be working.  That said, we have a lot of work left to do. Not all of our solutions are completely reported to the platform and the platform isn't as modular as we wish it were, we're working on that. So there's definitely plenty of investments still going in. But from a customer reception standpoint, we have medium and large financial institutions who have adopted it. Mike, you want to take that? Yes, I would say both of those proceed to pace, and that we have \u2013 am I hearing this interference.  We are making progress on both the external facing APIs and on FICO Studio, there's more of that to come, but much of that will be ready this year. Yes, I guess I would say that it is right sized. We don't have any plans for any significant divestiture going forward, at least not at this time. So I would call it right sized. I think the way to think about it is that the application solutions will increasingly be available on top of the decision management platforms and you so [inaudible] bear with you how those things break out. But you know right sized, yes. Will started with the revenue and I think we'll have the TBD on getting down to margin level. The shorter term length is significant. It's \u2013 Mike can keep me honest, I think it's on the order of 25% reduction in term length, so it's significant. In terms of whose idea is that, we always do what the customer wants.  That said, if we had \u2013 to the extent that we have a choice in the matter, our preferences were shorter, because we do think that's a better way to go. We think that there are more opportunities for us to revisit things sooner if we go for the shorter term length.  So, and this is part of why we changed the way we compensate our sales force as well. We used to compensate on bookings and longer terms to commissions and we no longer do that. Our goal is to provide the term that our customer wants, but shorter is absolutely fine with us. Well, it's probably skews is not even the right way to think about it. Because when we think about skews we are, I don't know, call it 150 skews. But the platform in its modular form provides the opportunity to do hundreds and potentially thousands of combinations of things. And so I think, I think what we are moving to is more of a usage based pricing and a modular pricing that lets customers mix and match the components that they want, to achieve the goals that they want from a solution standpoint and so it's not like everything will be pre-packaged. Obviously, we stayed close to it through our channel partners, the bureaus. But we also certainly for all of the major institutions, we have direct sales relationships, and so any significant activity in one direction or another is well understood by our people and we are in a dialogue with them. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining. This concludes today's call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks for joining."

Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday May 5, 2021. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Please go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO\u2019s second quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.

A replay of this webcast will be available through May 5, 2022. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by saying that I hope you are all safe and healthy. And I want to thank our dedicated FICO employees who have done an exceptional job meeting the challenges in the last year and never wavering in their commitment to FICO or their colleagues and our customers. We've tremendous team, a great culture at FICO and I'm really honored to report that FICO was ranked number one on Forbes' annual list of America's best midsize employers. On the investor relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we do our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. And I'll discuss how we continue to refine our strategy to optimize our Scores asset and sharpen our focus on our world-class decision management platform. We reported revenues of $331 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $69 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.33 per share, up 18% and 20%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $90 million, up 40%, and earnings per share of $3.06 was up 42%. from last year. We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Second quarter free cash flow was a record $152 million, up 178% from last year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives throughout the company. As we've said, for the last several quarters, we're continuing to migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model, including SaaS software subscriptions, and tern license subscriptions for on-prem software. This strategic decision will provide a more representative view of the growth trajectory of our business. But it also gives us some difficult comparisons for last year, when we had significant upfront license revenues. In our application segment, we delivered $130 million of revenue, down 8% from last year due to a 29% decline in upfront license revenues, and a 21% decline in professional services revenues. In our decision management segment, we delivered $33 million of revenue, up versus our Q1, but down 14% due to reduced upfront licenses and lower services revenue. Transactional revenues and DMS were up 34%, and as we continue to transition more of our software business to a recurring SaaS model. We continue to have a lot of interest in this technology and our pipeline contains more big deals as we continue to gain traction in the space. We remain committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we're focusing our resources to make that vision a reality. On the Score side, the business continues to perform very well. Scores were up 31% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 25%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations, which grew substantially year-over-year and also sequentially. We'll see more difficult comps in the back half of our year as it's now been a year since the refi boom began. Auto origination volumes were fairly flat, but revenues were up versus the previous year. We're continuing to see positive signs in cards and other unsecured loan activity. Volumes were still down from last year, but were higher than Q1. The price increases we instituted are starting to have an impact, giving us revenue increases in pockets where volumes are weaker. On the consumer side, we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 47% versus the same quarter last year. The growth of myfico.com is particularly remarkable, up 82% this quarter versus last year. The continued strong demand is a testament to the quality of our offering and an understanding by consumers that FICO, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know today, we announced the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Michael provides some financial details in a few minutes. But I'd like to explain the strategic rationale behind this move. We're extremely focused on our strategic vision to enhance expand and distribute the FICO decision management platform. We believe we have an incredible opportunity to be a best-in-class leader in the next wave of business analytic technology. In order to fulfill our potential, we need to make choices to be able to allocate all the resources we can to the platform strategy. The FICO collections and recovery products help customers make important decisions throughout the lifecycle of collections and recovery. These products deliver excellent functionality and serve an important customer need. But the complexity of the underlying architecture makes it impractical to migrate to our platform, coupled with the need for high-touch professional services, engagements and customization, it doesn't fit within our strategic framework. So as we did with our ESS divestiture, and as we do with our China joint venture, we've chosen to sharpen our focus and align our resources on our decision platform. I would like to thank the team that built and delivered an industry leading set of products and solutions that have helped our clients, enhance their collections and recovery efficiency, effectiveness and compliance. I want to assure the collections and recovery customers at FICO and Jonas Software are committed to serving our clients without disruption during this transition period. We're confident that Jonas Software will continue to invest in these solutions and support our clients and colleagues with the same commitment and partnership they've come to expect. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. The first I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our second quarter results in more detail and provide some information on the impact of the divestiture of the collection and recovery products that we announced today. Revenue for the quarter was $331 million and increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $130 million, down 8% versus the same period last year. The quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in upfront on-prem license revenue and professional services revenue. In our decision management software segment, Q2 revenues were $33 million, down 14% over the same period last year. We had an increase of 34% in SaaS subscription revenue in the DMS segment, but that was offset by decreases in upfront on-prem license and services rep. Now, before turning to our Scores segment, I would like to remind you the key moving parts that are impacting our application and our DMS segment revenues. First, our on-premise license revenues will continue to be negatively impacted as we move away from perpetual license sales to a ratable subscription revenue model. Second, we have changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on-premise license subscription sales. As a result, we now recognize less licensed revenue upfront, and we recognize more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue on our applications and DMS segment, of about $6 million, versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be between $45 million to $50 million, lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods. We expect them especially difficult year-over-year license comparison in our fourth fiscal quarter, where last year we booked more than $60 million in upfront license revenue under the prior methodology. As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing will not have an impact on pre-cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Finally, as we explained last quarter, we are de emphasizing low margin non-strategic professional services engagement, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Professional Services are a very important component of our business model, providing installation and configuration services for our software, and advisory and consulting expertise that enables our customer to leverage the power of cutting edge analytics in their business. These parts of our professional services business are here to stay. The reductions you are seeing in our services business are the result of our strategic decision to focus our energies on these value added services. Now turning to our Score segment. Revenues were $169 million, up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 25% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes and mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different Score categories. In the B2B business, we also had a royalty true-up and an annual license deal this quarter that had a small positive impact on overall revenues. B2C scores revenues were up 47% from the same period last year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, or EMEA region generated 15% and the remaining 6% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues, and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues were $62 million for the quarter, up 8.8% from the prior year. Q2 bookings totaled $84 million, flat with the previous year, those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues a 10% heal. SaaS bookings including the associated professional services were $25 million for the quarter, down 19% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $22 million were down 35% from last year. However, overall software bookings excluding professional services bookings were up 5% year over year. We continue to see a strong pipeline for our software products and we feel good about the bookings outlook for the full fiscal year. But again, we do expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de emphasis of professional services sales, and somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS and on-prem term license contracts. As a side note, we remain committed to providing our shareholders with more of the common metrics that subscription software companies typically provide in order to give investors a better understanding of our software business. We continue to work to extract and validate the necessary data and we hope to be able to provide it sometime this fiscal year.  Our operating expenses totaled $230 million this quarter, compared to $218 million in the prior quarter, which included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets. Excluding that one time gain expenses were a 5 million, primarily due to increased incentives expense. Compared to Q2, 2020. operating expenses were down $2 million. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the back half of the year as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings we incurred last year to add strategic headcount primarily related to the development of our decision management platform software. We also expect our travel entertainment expense to increase once we were able to resume in person meetings with our customers and colleagues. Our non GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 700 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $69 million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $90 million for the quarter, up 40% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We expect our FY, 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%. And we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. That's prior to the impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery business. We do expect to book a taxable gain on the sale, and we will provide more details on that next quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $152 million compared to $55 million in the same period last year, an increase of 178%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $461 million. At the end of the quarter we had $198 million in cash, up $53 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $975 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. Turning to return to capital. We bought back 441,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $466 per share. During the quarter, the board -- the prior board repurchase authorization was exhausted and a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $470 million remaining on that authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, I'll walk through the expected impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery products. As Will said, we made the decision to divest these assets to increase our focus on our decision management platform. The collection and recovery products we sold accounted for less than 10% of total company revenues. Because they often involve significant PF engagement, as much as half of total revenues. They had a much lower margin profile than our platform products. There will be some noise in the next few quarters as we work through the transition. But we expect that this divestiture will not have a significant impact on our pre tax income. We expect to close the deal sometime in our third fiscal quarter. And the sales proceeds will contribute to the funding of a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program that we plan to execute once the transaction closes. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.\nWill Lansing: Thank you Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on our strategy and committed to taking our decision management platform to growing number of interested customers. At the same time, we are innovating and providing a cornerstone value in Scores in both B2B and B2C. Finally, as you know, we haven't provided guidance for this fiscal year, we still see a lot of volatility, as we see the global economy begin to open back up. We have tremendous confidence in our business model that are far more focused on providing long term value than hitting specific numbers for the next few quarters. It's those values that drive us to favor ratable subscription revenue over upfront license revenue. So for now, we're not providing any formal guidance until we see how the credit markets stabilize and we understand the full year impact of our recognition of license revenues. Now, I'll turn the call back to Steve, so that we can do some Q&A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. This is actually Greg on for Manav. I think the divestitures you've made so far make a lot of sense when you explain them. Just wondering if there's any smaller products left out there that could be candidates for similar treatment? Or from here, it's more about being selective in the contract going forward?\nWill Lansing: I would say that this is pretty much the end of the reprioritization of our resources. So we don't see any significant divestitures in our immediate future.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And historically, M&A hasn't been a big part of the story. As you go through this process of reprioritization and thinking about capital allocation, is there potential for M&A to be a bigger part of the story going forward?\nWill Lansing: I'd say that the potential in the future is about the same as the potential in the past, it's always been there. And we've always had trouble finding anything that we find as attractive as investing in ourselves. Our current plan is to deploy all of the proceeds from this transaction in stock repurchase.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And maybe last one for me. Just on the sales pipeline for the software business, I think you said, you're pretty bullish about what you're seeing. Any color by geography as we see different fits and starts and reopening by geography. If there's any areas that you're seeing more traction. Any color, that would be helpful? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: I'd say that South America is strong. But we're seeing signs of the economy waking up kind of across the board. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.\nMike McLaughlin: I guess what I would add is the nature of our sales on the software side are lumpy and long sales cycle for the most part. And so, month-to-month, even quarter-to-quarter changes in the ability of our customers to have people in the office, to meet face-to-face due to the pandemic and other things, it doesn't necessarily show up with the same frequency to might for a company that had, a shorter sales cycle and more higher frequency, lower ticket sales. So, the pipeline that we see in the major regions we serve looks healthy, all things considered in all regions. And I wouldn't be able to identify anything specific that would make one region or another standout.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to talk a little bit about the expense trajectory. I know, you guys said that, you expect those to go up a little bit next quarter, given some investments pick in the DMS side? Does that outlook include the transition of some of the costs associated with the debt collection business? Or how should we think about kind of the expense trajectory and what transition costs and stuff you guys expect to occur?\nMike McLaughlin: We'll be able to provide more. Can you hear me?\nKyle Peterson: Yes.\nMike McLaughlin: Sure. So we'll be able to provide a little bit more detail on that when we get to the closing. So stay tuned next quarter for any more specifics we're able to share. In general, as we said in our remarks, we don't expect it to have material impact on profitability, which means that the expenses that we expect to remove, we're in the ballpark of the revenues that we are selling. And furthermore, we do continue to believe that our expenses for the year relative to last year will be about the same if not down little bit. So all the trends that we saw in our expenses, not including the impact of collection and recovery, divestiture, continue to play out and we still feel good about the full year.\nKyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess just on the scores business. Quarter came in very strong. Is there any additional color you guys could give us on, what drove some of that strength between some of the recent pricing initiatives that you guys have taken versus just volume with some of the -- with healthy credit markets and the strong B2C business?\nWill Lansing: I'd say, it's more on the volume than on the pricing, although the pricing is trying to feather in as card and some of the places where we put price increases in last year start to pick up in volume. So its both. But I tip to volume. And then, I think the real strength, mortgage continues to be strong and the real strength I think is B2C is just remarkable.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon. Question on the B2C. Can you provide a little bit of additional color, obviously you provided some metrics, but the revenue growth sequentially was really strong after there was a temporary pause. Any color in kind of what drove that? Was there additional marketing with your partners that we should be thinking about maybe some seasonality? In any outlook, you can provide that would be helpful?\nWill Lansing: No. I would I would put it in two categories, because the strongest part of it was myFICO. And I'd say it's attributable to very strong execution. There's some seasonality, of course, but I attribute some of the strength to very strong execution. And to consumer and consumers increasingly interested.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And what is the current mix between myfico.com and your partner at this point in terms of the B2C revenues?\nWill Lansing: Here, I'm not sure we break that out. Mike, I don't know that we disclose that. Do we?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. We don't disclose that. Sorry.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the special price increases that went into effect. If I believe I heard you correctly, you talked about them feathering in at this point. So how should we think about? Are they currently at the full run rate in this -- maybe at the full run rate in this quarter? Or maybe did half of them hit last quarter, two-thirds of them? How should we think about that mix?\nWill Lansing: Well, I think you shouldn't think in terms of fully in except that the volumes that they were applied -- the kinds of scores they were applied to had lower volumes. And so as those volumes returned, you'll see a little more impact. But at this point volume going forward.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And if I understand correctly, it was mostly on the card and auto side for the impact?\nWill Lansing: It was spread around, there was card -- there were card increases.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And how far below normalized levels is card volumes at this point? Obviously, auto volumes have fully recovered. We can pretty much track mortgage volumes on a daily basis, but there's less inside into card volume. Any additional color you can provide there?\nWill Lansing: I really can't. I will say, that we have seen sequential increases in cards, which you can also see from the results this quarter of the card issuers and the bureaus. So we're seeing the same trends they see, and overall across our categories. So whether its cards, autos or mortgage volume trends that we've seen are not inconsistent with what you can see from or some others who are in those businesses.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. That's its on my part. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Caroline Conway with AllianceBernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nCaroline Conway : Great. Thank you for taking my question. I'm curious about the implications of the divestiture on customer retention. And the strategy for expansion into new service areas with existing customers. What seem to me to be beneficial to keep a relatively full suite of financial services products available, especially as we look to drive DMS adoption, but that may be overestimating the role of this product line. So it would be great to get your thoughts on that strategically?\nWill Lansing: No. You're absolutely right that our customers -- we have many customers who are customers of the collections and recovery product line as well as many other solutions that we provide. And we've always believed that, the broader suite of capabilities has high utility for our customers. This is really -- and our customers won't suffer from this. So our customers are going to wind up with continued tremendous support and innovation and investment in this product line from Jonas. And we have a close relationship with Jonas. We'll be doing coverage together. And so, I don't worry very much about whether our customers to well taken care of, because I'm confident that they will be well taken care of. What it does do is it frees up the resources and investment for us to focus on the platform side of the solutions that we provide to our customers. So no question that, that's the right place for us to be focused.\nCaroline Conway : Great. And just as a follow up to that, are there any other components of the relationship with Jonas that you're expecting to emerge? Are there any products that you're expecting to leverage from their side?\nWill Lansing: No. It's really a collection -- around collections and recovery. But then we have some parts of our FICO that will continue to operate in and near and around the collection space. So for example, FICO advisors will continue to provide consulting, advice around collections. But the generally speaking, the business is turned over to Jonas, and we'll make sure that the transition is seamless.\nCaroline Conway : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from the line of Jeff Mueler with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Mueler: Thank you. Good afternoon, on myFICO, so recognize your brand strength, recognize that part of the market is doing well in terms of the branded paid channel. I guess the indirect and some lead gen players pulled back. I'm not talking about your partners, I'm talking about alternatives in the market pulled back at points over the last year, which I think benefits the myFICO channel. Anything further you can say about execution, if it's changes in how you're going about marketing or changes in product? What I'm trying to get comfort with this some sustainability of myFICO strength, if some of those lead gen partners start to lean back into the market?\nWill Lansing: Yes. It's a good question. And I it's hard for us to say whether the impact is from them pulling back or from our own excellent execution. What seems to be happening is there's a lot -- at least in my mind, is that there's a lot of appetite and interest in monitoring credit, particularly times like these. And it's a very natural place to go is myFICO.com. And as you know, we do actually relatively modest marketing around it. But the brand is very strong. We have over 90% aided awareness to the FICO brand in the U.S. And so it's not surprising that we got a lot of attention there. I think we will always be positioned -- we'll always position ourselves as an innovation leader and having really robust and fully featured products. And the premium -- we try to be the premium product in the marketplace, as well as a bit of a lab for experimenting with offerings that we then turn over to our partners, encourage them to replicate.\nJeff Mueler: Okay. And then just maybe any update on the uptake or usage of the resilience score index?\nWill Lansing: It continues to be used, and it's in test with essentially. We have -- we actually have quite a number of lenders were using it now. And so far, the feedback is very positive. And we're not charging for it. It doesn't have any revenue impact.\nJeff Mueler: Right. Okay. And then last. I get that we're going to get the new, more typical software assess reporting financial metrics later in the year, but just -- can you help us ring fence like, what is on strategy revenue, like you talk about it, it feels to me like in several different ways you have I think, DMS, DMP there's, the SaaS versions of different products, you gave us a metric ex professional services. So can you just help us ring fence what you're viewing? It's kind of like core on strategy and where it sits today?\nWill Lansing: Let me turn this over to Mike in just a minute to answer that question more fully. But what I would say is, everything that we have left in our portfolio is what we want to have in our portfolio. And it's a combination of legacy products and our platform products. We've been in a process of migrating and moving the capabilities from legacy products to the platform. And so increasingly, the new sales happen on the platform, we consider that to be truly strategic. So platform sales are where we want to be lend to South wells to land and expand, lets our customers who leverage a platform for small incremental investments get a lot incremental benefit. I mean, there's benefits for FICO and for our customers on the platform. That said, we have a really large business of FICO Solutions that are in place, on-prem, some in the cloud, but mostly on-prem. And we anticipate that those will be in use by our customers for many years to come. And so we continue to invest in those. We will continue to maintain those. We'll continue to make sure that our customers getting the full benefit of the investment that they made over past years. And as they're ready to migrate to the platform, we'll be ready to take them there. But the business really has both sides. And what you'll see is that the -- call it legacy solutions, the off platform solutions, we're not selling nearly as much of that going forward. And the energy is going into selling platform. But we'll be supporting both. Mike, if you want to add anything.\nMike McLaughlin: Sure. Hey, Jeff. Look, as we think about how to recast our reporting to be more helpful to you and our shareholders. The principles are, the focuses on recurring software revenue, hence are beginning to shine more of a spotlight on the services revenue, because those are declining. We're trying to make them decline, but we're just trying to focus on the services that really add value and let them reach their natural level in terms of revenue. The margin profile is not such that we generate a whole lot of value out of the services directly value to our customers and increase the stickiness and all that. But PS revenue for PS revenue sake is not something we're seeking. So our focus is on recurring software. And so our metrics will help you see that more clearly. Second, is the apps versus DMS distinction is less and less relevant. It's been in place for a long time in our disclosure, but it's outlived its usefulness. So we're likely to simplify and talk more about software versus scores as opposed to application scores and DMS. And then finally, the key -- the Prime Directive in our software business is platform. And so we'll help you get better insight into what our platform revenues are doing. And what's happening in our revenues that are -- call them to-be platform. Not yet, but on the roadmap. So those are the things we're trying to achieve as we think about how best to expose it to you.\nJeff Mueler: I think we all look forward to that. So thanks, guys.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the presentation back to Mr. Weber.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today's call. Have a good day. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Mike McLaughlin",
            "content": "Thanks Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today I'll walk you through our second quarter results in more detail and provide some information on the impact of the divestiture of the collection and recovery products that we announced today. Revenue for the quarter was $331 million and increase of 8% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $130 million, down 8% versus the same period last year. The quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in upfront on-prem license revenue and professional services revenue. In our decision management software segment, Q2 revenues were $33 million, down 14% over the same period last year. We had an increase of 34% in SaaS subscription revenue in the DMS segment, but that was offset by decreases in upfront on-prem license and services rep. Now, before turning to our Scores segment, I would like to remind you the key moving parts that are impacting our application and our DMS segment revenues. First, our on-premise license revenues will continue to be negatively impacted as we move away from perpetual license sales to a ratable subscription revenue model. Second, we have changed our revenue recognition assumptions for on-premise license subscription sales. As a result, we now recognize less licensed revenue upfront, and we recognize more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. The net impact this quarter was lower license revenue on our applications and DMS segment, of about $6 million, versus what it would have been under our prior methodology. We anticipate the full year impact will be between $45 million to $50 million, lower software license revenue this year, all of which will be recognized in future periods. We expect them especially difficult year-over-year license comparison in our fourth fiscal quarter, where last year we booked more than $60 million in upfront license revenue under the prior methodology. As we pointed out in the past, this change in timing will not have an impact on pre-cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Finally, as we explained last quarter, we are de emphasizing low margin non-strategic professional services engagement, which is resulting in lower PS bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Professional Services are a very important component of our business model, providing installation and configuration services for our software, and advisory and consulting expertise that enables our customer to leverage the power of cutting edge analytics in their business. These parts of our professional services business are here to stay. The reductions you are seeing in our services business are the result of our strategic decision to focus our energies on these value added services. Now turning to our Score segment. Revenues were $169 million, up 31% from the same period last year. B2B was up 25% over the same period last year, driven by continued high volumes and mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our different Score categories. In the B2B business, we also had a royalty true-up and an annual license deal this quarter that had a small positive impact on overall revenues. B2C scores revenues were up 47% from the same period last year, both myfico.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. This quarter 79% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, or EMEA region generated 15% and the remaining 6% was from Asia Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 85% of total revenues. consulting and implementation services revenues were 11% of total revenues, and license revenues were 4% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues, not including related PS revenues were $62 million for the quarter, up 8.8% from the prior year. Q2 bookings totaled $84 million, flat with the previous year, those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues a 10% heal. SaaS bookings including the associated professional services were $25 million for the quarter, down 19% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $22 million were down 35% from last year. However, overall software bookings excluding professional services bookings were up 5% year over year. We continue to see a strong pipeline for our software products and we feel good about the bookings outlook for the full fiscal year. But again, we do expect bookings to trend lower overall compared to historical numbers as a result of our de emphasis of professional services sales, and somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS and on-prem term license contracts. As a side note, we remain committed to providing our shareholders with more of the common metrics that subscription software companies typically provide in order to give investors a better understanding of our software business. We continue to work to extract and validate the necessary data and we hope to be able to provide it sometime this fiscal year.  Our operating expenses totaled $230 million this quarter, compared to $218 million in the prior quarter, which included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets. Excluding that one time gain expenses were a 5 million, primarily due to increased incentives expense. Compared to Q2, 2020. operating expenses were down $2 million. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the back half of the year as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings we incurred last year to add strategic headcount primarily related to the development of our decision management platform software. We also expect our travel entertainment expense to increase once we were able to resume in person meetings with our customers and colleagues. Our non GAAP operating margin as shown in our Reg G schedule was 39% for the quarter, a margin expansion of 700 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $69 million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $90 million for the quarter, up 40% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We expect our FY, 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27%. And we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. That's prior to the impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery business. We do expect to book a taxable gain on the sale, and we will provide more details on that next quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $152 million compared to $55 million in the same period last year, an increase of 178%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $461 million. At the end of the quarter we had $198 million in cash, up $53 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $975 million with a weighted average interest rate of 3.9%. Turning to return to capital. We bought back 441,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $466 per share. During the quarter, the board -- the prior board repurchase authorization was exhausted and a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $470 million remaining on that authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. Finally, I'll walk through the expected impact of the divestiture of our collection and recovery products. As Will said, we made the decision to divest these assets to increase our focus on our decision management platform. The collection and recovery products we sold accounted for less than 10% of total company revenues. Because they often involve significant PF engagement, as much as half of total revenues. They had a much lower margin profile than our platform products. There will be some noise in the next few quarters as we work through the transition. But we expect that this divestiture will not have a significant impact on our pre tax income. We expect to close the deal sometime in our third fiscal quarter. And the sales proceeds will contribute to the funding of a $200 million accelerated share repurchase program that we plan to execute once the transaction closes. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts. I guess what I would add is the nature of our sales on the software side are lumpy and long sales cycle for the most part. And so, month-to-month, even quarter-to-quarter changes in the ability of our customers to have people in the office, to meet face-to-face due to the pandemic and other things, it doesn't necessarily show up with the same frequency to might for a company that had, a shorter sales cycle and more higher frequency, lower ticket sales. So, the pipeline that we see in the major regions we serve looks healthy, all things considered in all regions. And I wouldn't be able to identify anything specific that would make one region or another standout. We'll be able to provide more. Can you hear me? Sure. So we'll be able to provide a little bit more detail on that when we get to the closing. So stay tuned next quarter for any more specifics we're able to share. In general, as we said in our remarks, we don't expect it to have material impact on profitability, which means that the expenses that we expect to remove, we're in the ballpark of the revenues that we are selling. And furthermore, we do continue to believe that our expenses for the year relative to last year will be about the same if not down little bit. So all the trends that we saw in our expenses, not including the impact of collection and recovery, divestiture, continue to play out and we still feel good about the full year. Yes. We don't disclose that. Sorry. Sure. Hey, Jeff. Look, as we think about how to recast our reporting to be more helpful to you and our shareholders. The principles are, the focuses on recurring software revenue, hence are beginning to shine more of a spotlight on the services revenue, because those are declining. We're trying to make them decline, but we're just trying to focus on the services that really add value and let them reach their natural level in terms of revenue. The margin profile is not such that we generate a whole lot of value out of the services directly value to our customers and increase the stickiness and all that.

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. I'd like to start by saying that I hope you are all safe and healthy. And I want to thank our dedicated FICO employees who have done an exceptional job meeting the challenges in the last year and never wavering in their commitment to FICO or their colleagues and our customers. We've tremendous team, a great culture at FICO and I'm really honored to report that FICO was ranked number one on Forbes' annual list of America's best midsize employers. On the investor relations section of our website we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we do our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. And I'll discuss how we continue to refine our strategy to optimize our Scores asset and sharpen our focus on our world-class decision management platform. We reported revenues of $331 million, an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $69 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.33 per share, up 18% and 20%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $90 million, up 40%, and earnings per share of $3.06 was up 42%. from last year. We continue to deliver very strong free cash flow growth as well. Second quarter free cash flow was a record $152 million, up 178% from last year. I'm pleased to report that we continue to execute well against our strategic initiatives throughout the company. As we've said, for the last several quarters, we're continuing to migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model, including SaaS software subscriptions, and tern license subscriptions for on-prem software. This strategic decision will provide a more representative view of the growth trajectory of our business. But it also gives us some difficult comparisons for last year, when we had significant upfront license revenues. In our application segment, we delivered $130 million of revenue, down 8% from last year due to a 29% decline in upfront license revenues, and a 21% decline in professional services revenues. In our decision management segment, we delivered $33 million of revenue, up versus our Q1, but down 14% due to reduced upfront licenses and lower services revenue. Transactional revenues and DMS were up 34%, and as we continue to transition more of our software business to a recurring SaaS model. We continue to have a lot of interest in this technology and our pipeline contains more big deals as we continue to gain traction in the space. We remain committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics and we're focusing our resources to make that vision a reality. On the Score side, the business continues to perform very well. Scores were up 31% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side, revenues were up 25%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations, which grew substantially year-over-year and also sequentially. We'll see more difficult comps in the back half of our year as it's now been a year since the refi boom began. Auto origination volumes were fairly flat, but revenues were up versus the previous year. We're continuing to see positive signs in cards and other unsecured loan activity. Volumes were still down from last year, but were higher than Q1. The price increases we instituted are starting to have an impact, giving us revenue increases in pockets where volumes are weaker. On the consumer side, we continue to drive impressive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 47% versus the same quarter last year. The growth of myfico.com is particularly remarkable, up 82% this quarter versus last year. The continued strong demand is a testament to the quality of our offering and an understanding by consumers that FICO, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know today, we announced the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line. Michael provides some financial details in a few minutes. But I'd like to explain the strategic rationale behind this move. We're extremely focused on our strategic vision to enhance expand and distribute the FICO decision management platform. We believe we have an incredible opportunity to be a best-in-class leader in the next wave of business analytic technology. In order to fulfill our potential, we need to make choices to be able to allocate all the resources we can to the platform strategy. The FICO collections and recovery products help customers make important decisions throughout the lifecycle of collections and recovery. These products deliver excellent functionality and serve an important customer need. But the complexity of the underlying architecture makes it impractical to migrate to our platform, coupled with the need for high-touch professional services, engagements and customization, it doesn't fit within our strategic framework. So as we did with our ESS divestiture, and as we do with our China joint venture, we've chosen to sharpen our focus and align our resources on our decision platform. I would like to thank the team that built and delivered an industry leading set of products and solutions that have helped our clients, enhance their collections and recovery efficiency, effectiveness and compliance. I want to assure the collections and recovery customers at FICO and Jonas Software are committed to serving our clients without disruption during this transition period. We're confident that Jonas Software will continue to invest in these solutions and support our clients and colleagues with the same commitment and partnership they've come to expect. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. The first I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thank you Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on our strategy and committed to taking our decision management platform to growing number of interested customers. At the same time, we are innovating and providing a cornerstone value in Scores in both B2B and B2C. Finally, as you know, we haven't provided guidance for this fiscal year, we still see a lot of volatility, as we see the global economy begin to open back up. We have tremendous confidence in our business model that are far more focused on providing long term value than hitting specific numbers for the next few quarters. It's those values that drive us to favor ratable subscription revenue over upfront license revenue. So for now, we're not providing any formal guidance until we see how the credit markets stabilize and we understand the full year impact of our recognition of license revenues. Now, I'll turn the call back to Steve, so that we can do some Q&A. I would say that this is pretty much the end of the reprioritization of our resources. So we don't see any significant divestitures in our immediate future. I'd say that the potential in the future is about the same as the potential in the past, it's always been there. And we've always had trouble finding anything that we find as attractive as investing in ourselves. Our current plan is to deploy all of the proceeds from this transaction in stock repurchase. I'd say that South America is strong. But we're seeing signs of the economy waking up kind of across the board. Mike, I don't know if you want to add anything to that. I'd say, it's more on the volume than on the pricing, although the pricing is trying to feather in as card and some of the places where we put price increases in last year start to pick up in volume. So its both. But I tip to volume. And then, I think the real strength, mortgage continues to be strong and the real strength I think is B2C is just remarkable. No. I would I would put it in two categories, because the strongest part of it was myFICO. And I'd say it's attributable to very strong execution. There's some seasonality, of course, but I attribute some of the strength to very strong execution. And to consumer and consumers increasingly interested. Here, I'm not sure we break that out. Mike, I don't know that we disclose that. Do we? Well, I think you shouldn't think in terms of fully in except that the volumes that they were applied -- the kinds of scores they were applied to had lower volumes. And so as those volumes returned, you'll see a little more impact. But at this point volume going forward. It was spread around, there was card -- there were card increases. I really can't. I will say, that we have seen sequential increases in cards, which you can also see from the results this quarter of the card issuers and the bureaus. So we're seeing the same trends they see, and overall across our categories. So whether its cards, autos or mortgage volume trends that we've seen are not inconsistent with what you can see from or some others who are in those businesses. No. You're absolutely right that our customers -- we have many customers who are customers of the collections and recovery product line as well as many other solutions that we provide. And we've always believed that, the broader suite of capabilities has high utility for our customers. This is really -- and our customers won't suffer from this. So our customers are going to wind up with continued tremendous support and innovation and investment in this product line from Jonas. And we have a close relationship with Jonas. We'll be doing coverage together. And so, I don't worry very much about whether our customers to well taken care of, because I'm confident that they will be well taken care of. What it does do is it frees up the resources and investment for us to focus on the platform side of the solutions that we provide to our customers. So no question that, that's the right place for us to be focused. No. It's really a collection -- around collections and recovery. But then we have some parts of our FICO that will continue to operate in and near and around the collection space. So for example, FICO advisors will continue to provide consulting, advice around collections. But the generally speaking, the business is turned over to Jonas, and we'll make sure that the transition is seamless. Yes. It's a good question. And I it's hard for us to say whether the impact is from them pulling back or from our own excellent execution. What seems to be happening is there's a lot -- at least in my mind, is that there's a lot of appetite and interest in monitoring credit, particularly times like these. And it's a very natural place to go is myFICO.com. And as you know, we do actually relatively modest marketing around it. But the brand is very strong. We have over 90% aided awareness to the FICO brand in the U.S. And so it's not surprising that we got a lot of attention there. I think we will always be positioned -- we'll always position ourselves as an innovation leader and having really robust and fully featured products. And the premium -- we try to be the premium product in the marketplace, as well as a bit of a lab for experimenting with offerings that we then turn over to our partners, encourage them to replicate. It continues to be used, and it's in test with essentially. We have -- we actually have quite a number of lenders were using it now. And so far, the feedback is very positive. And we're not charging for it. It doesn't have any revenue impact. Let me turn this over to Mike in just a minute to answer that question more fully. But what I would say is, everything that we have left in our portfolio is what we want to have in our portfolio. And it's a combination of legacy products and our platform products. We've been in a process of migrating and moving the capabilities from legacy products to the platform. And so increasingly, the new sales happen on the platform, we consider that to be truly strategic. So platform sales are where we want to be lend to South wells to land and expand, lets our customers who leverage a platform for small incremental investments get a lot incremental benefit. I mean, there's benefits for FICO and for our customers on the platform. That said, we have a really large business of FICO Solutions that are in place, on-prem, some in the cloud, but mostly on-prem. And we anticipate that those will be in use by our customers for many years to come. And so we continue to invest in those. We will continue to maintain those. We'll continue to make sure that our customers getting the full benefit of the investment that they made over past years. And as they're ready to migrate to the platform, we'll be ready to take them there. But the business really has both sides. And what you'll see is that the -- call it legacy solutions, the off platform solutions, we're not selling nearly as much of that going forward. And the energy is going into selling platform. But we'll be supporting both. Mike, if you want to add anything."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode and afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The conference is being recorded Thursday, January 28, 2021. And now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining FICO\u2019s first quarter earnings call. I am Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I am joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is concern -- is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 28, 2022. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining our first quarter earnings call. As we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We are still primarily working from home and most of our offices remain closed. I am grateful to our dedicated employees who every day show their commitment to FICO and to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we have posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our first quarter. I am pleased to say, we started 2021 well, as we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. We have reported revenues of $312 million, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. We are pleased with that result because we knew we would have headwinds on the software side as we transition toward more ratable recognition of our subscription software license revenues and our first fiscal quarter is typically our slowest software new business quarter. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.90 per share, up 57% and 59%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $82 million, up 51% and earnings per share of $2.74 was up 52% from last year, as we reap the benefits of the cost reductions we put in place last year. As we discussed last quarter, some of those savings will be reinvested as we identify opportunities and hire additional individuals in key strategic areas. We continue to deliver free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $75 million, up 39% from last year. I am encouraged by the progress we are making across the business. The decisioning market continues to grow and we are well-positioned to serve it. In fact, in December, Forrester issued a Digital Decisioning Platform report and named FICO as a leader in space. The FICO Decision Management Platform was recognized for providing all the tools necessary to manage and deploy digital decisions, which will stand up to the highest standard of regulatory rigor. We have been helping financial institutions make lending decisions for decades. We now bring that same level of automated analyst decisioning to the broader market to help businesses respond quickly to customers\u2019 needs and anticipate their future demands. As we migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model including SaaS software subscriptions and term license subscriptions for on-prem software. We will see less upfront license revenue than we would have in the past as the revenue spread over the term of the deal. Last quarter we talked about how we would recognize less revenue upfront for on-premise licenses and that change pushed about $9 million of revenue this quarter out to future quarters. This doesn\u2019t affect cash flows or total revenues recognized but it does delay the timing of revenues and over time will smooth the lumpiness we have historically seen. This changes in line with industry standards and we believe it will provide a more representative transparent view of the growth trajectory of our business. In our Application segment, we delivered $135 million revenue, down 11% from last year. This was due to a decline in upfront license revenues into a lesser extent professional services revenues. The license revenue was negatively affected by a smaller amount of term licenses upfront through renewal in the quarter and the revenue recognition change I mentioned earlier. In our Decision Management segment, we delivered $32 million of revenue, up 4%, despite many of the same issues we described in our Application segment. Our license revenue declined versus the previous year, transactional revenues in DMS were up 36%, providing the steady predictable recurring revenue stream that we believe will continue to grow. We have had a lot of interest in our decisioning platform and we sold a number of large deals in the best few quarters. We are working hard to install and get those customers live, so you can begin seeing the impacts from those recurring revenues. As I have often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. This is the strategic focus of our software business. And like I said last quarter that may mean exiting non-strategic products or services, we are not signing or renewing low margin services led project work. Last fall, we sold our Enterprise Security Score business, because although we believe the effectiveness and value of the product is off strategy and need to remain incredibly focused to maximize the opportunity that\u2019s in front of us. In December, we entered into a joint venture with a longstanding partner in China that distributes FICO Scores. And the joint venture will now distribute all software solutions for the China market. Moving forward, this will allow us to serve that market with less infrastructure and therefore a better margins. So this and the ESS deal will have a small near-term negative impact on topline revenues, but will help our overall margins and again allow us to focus on our overarching strategy. We expect more adjustments to be made of our software business as we make the necessary decisions to pursue our strategic initiatives. On the Scores side, the business continues to reform very well. Scores were up 26% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side revenues were up 20%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations volumes, although normal seasonality wasn\u2019t quite as strong as our fourth quarter. Auto originations were relatively flat versus the previous year. We are starting to see signs of cards and other unsecured loans beginning to bounce back, as both prescreen and origination activities picked up in that space. As we discussed last quarter we did institute some price increases across various volunteers. Those price increases start to feather in during our second quarter and we can talk more about those impacts when we release the results of our March quarter. On the consumer side, we continue to drive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 40% versus same quarter last year. The growth at myFICO.com is even more impressive up 69% this quarter versus last year. The recent results of our myFICO business, as well as our partner\u2019s experience, demonstrate that savvy consumers want the FICO Score, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know, we haven\u2019t provided guidance since the middle of our last fiscal year. We are still operating in a marketplace in the economy with a great deal of uncertainty and volatility. While our business has been remarkably resilient over the past year, it\u2019s still difficult to quantify what macro trends will impact our volumes. So while we are confident in our prospects this year, we still believe that there\u2019s a wide range of possible outcomes depending on the timing of vaccine rollout and the opening back up of the global economy. As we move through the year, we will provide more color than we believe it is prudent. I will give final comments in a few minutes, but first let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter results in more detail and briefly discuss the impact we are seeing from the restructuring and impairment charges we took in the fall and the revenue recognition assumptions we talked about last quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $312 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $135 million, down 11% versus the same period last year. This quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by decreased term license revenues. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q1 revenues were $32 million, up 4% over the same period last year. The revenue increase was due to increased SaaS subscription revenue partially offset by lower license revenues. As Will mentioned, our license revenues are down as we transition to a more ratable subscription revenue model. Last quarter we explained how we would be recognizing less of our on-premise software deals upfront license revenue and recognizing more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. In addition to this change we are also selling more SaaS deals which further reduces the upfront revenues. Finally, we are also deemphasizing a low margin of non-strategic professional services engagement, which will likely have a negative near-term impact on professional services bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Turning to our Score segment, revenues were $145 million, up 26% from the same period last year. B2B revenues were up 20% over the same period last year, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our Score categories. B2C revenues were up 40% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. Score\u2019s revenue was down 5% sequentially from Q4, but as a reminder, last quarter we had a material onetime royalty true-up that increased reporting revenue. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and then the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 81% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total revenues and license revenues were 6% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues were $60 million for the quarter, up 4% from the previous year. Q1 bookings totaled $68 million, down 39% from the previous year. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 13% deal. SaaS bookings were $20 million for the quarter, down 45% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $16 million were down 61% from last year. Our fiscal first quarter bookings are generally lower each year, particularly after a strong quarter like we delivered last quarter and our quarterly bookings can be quite volatile from quarter-to-quarter. We feel good about the bookings outlook for the rest of the fiscal year despite the relatively light bookings in Q1. However, it is important to note that we do expect bookings to trend lower overall as a result of our deemphasize on professional services sales and the somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS contracts. As we discussed last quarter, we have shifted the sales of our on-premise software away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and ongoing maintenance. This quarter, we adjusted our revenue recognition to be consistent with this change and industry standards for software subscription sales. This change results in less upfront revenue recognized in the quarter we signed a subscription contract and more revenue from that contract recognized ratably during the term of the subscription. This quarter, the impact of this change was an in-quarter reduction of revenue of approximately $9 million. Those are revenues that would have been claimed this quarter under the old sales model and will now be recognized over the term of the contract. As a reminder, this will not have an impact on our quarterly cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Our operating expenses totaled $218 million this quarter, compared to $289 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets and the prior quarter included $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges, expenses were down $22 million due to decreased commission expenses associated with lower revenue, reduced incentive expenses and cost savings resulting from the restructuring actions we took last September. Compared to Q1 2020, operating expenses before one-time events were down $14 million, due to decreased marketing expenses resulting from a large customer event held in Q1 2020, lower travel and entertainment expense and cost savings resulting from our Q4 2020 restructuring. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the coming quarters and as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings to add strategic headcount, primarily related to the development of our Decision Management Platform Software. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 36% for the quarter and margin expansion of 900 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter with $86 million up 57% from the prior year quarter and included a gain of about $7 million from the sale of our EFS types technology and our JV agreement in China. Our non-GAAP net income was $82 million for the quarter, up 51% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 2%, including $19 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurrent tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $75 million, compared to $54 million in the same period last year, an increase of 39%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $364 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had $145 million in cash, down $13 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $881 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. And finally return of capital, we bought back 101,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $494 per share. At the end of December, we had about $175 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on building out our platform and taking it to an ever expanding marketplace. We will continue to invest at levels we think are appropriate to make the most of our incredible opportunity, and of course, we will continue to innovate and make the most of our incredible Scores asset. I am now turning the call over to Steve for Q&A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Surinder Thind from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon, gentlemen. My first question is actually on the Scores business. If we were to look at the B2C revenues, if my math is correct, they were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Can you provide a little bit of color there, because if we look back over the past few quarters there been a significant acceleration each quarter in the revenues and I thought that was a bit of a subscription based business. So if you can just help me understand what appears to be a sudden slowdown in new signings or if there is an offset -- where there\u2019s new signings offset by certain individuals canceling subscriptions?\nWill Lansing: I am not sure I follow the question.\nSurinder Thind: So, for your B2B revenues, they -- if my math is correct, they were unchanged quarter-over-quarter. Can you provide a little bit of color, because if we look at the previous quarters, there was significant acceleration each quarter on a sequential basis and that doesn\u2019t -- it didn\u2019t appear to occur this quarter?\nWill Lansing: That\u2019s right. It didn\u2019t appear this quarter. Mike, go ahead.\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. I can jump in with some specific. So B2C revenues were up quarter-over-quarter, but not a lot, call it, $1 million. If you look back to Q4 to Q1, a year ago, it was kind of the same factor. So there is some seasonality Q4 to Q1 and the year-over-year compare continues to be very strong. But you are right, the quarter over quarter additions just were not as large as they were in the last two quarters particularly.\nWill Lansing: And it\u2019s worth adding that there was a settlement in the prior quarter.\nSurinder Thind: Understood. On the Score -- on the B2B part. Understood. In terms of the -- and then maybe as my follow-up question, on the software side of the business, it seems like there\u2019s a -- unless I -- it seemed like there\u2019s a change in strategy to maybe focus more on the sales of SaaS products versus on-premise. Is that a little bit of a change from our previous discussions or the way because I thought the margins in the two businesses were relatively the same and that the thought was is that, from a plan perspective, that it was going to be a significant amount of time before the transition in your business occurred in that. Are you guys looking to accelerate\u2026\nWill Lansing: I would say, from a strategy standpoint, the way -- we don\u2019t emphasize the one business over the other. We really try to do what\u2019s appropriate for the customer. And so, while we love the characteristics of the SaaS business, where appropriate, we will absolutely do license on-prem deals and we don\u2019t favor -- we don\u2019t really favor one over the other.\nSurinder Thind: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Yeah. Good afternoon. Good evening, I guess. So just on the software piece, so firstly the fraud licenses I guess the decline there. It sounds like most of that is because you are not renewing lower margin services. I was just hoping to get an example of what that is, because I would imagine anything enforced is probably valuable and worth sticking with. So maybe you can just help us how that decision works.\nWill Lansing: Mike, do you have a view on that?\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. Sure. So\u2026\nManav Patnaik: Hi, Mike.\nMike McLaughlin: \u2026if you look at the license -- yeah. Manav, if you look at the license itself. As we said, it\u2019s -- and I am not just address fraud because probably the bigger question is that we are down about $15 million year-over-year from license sales. As we said about $9 million of that was purely related to the revenue recognition sale. It was also a quarter where we had less license renewals available to renew. If you followed us long enough then you know that that can be very lumpy. In Q3 we had another low quarter of last year, but Q2 was high. It just goes up and down. We can only renew that which is available. So it was a low renewal quarter. Not that we missed renewals or people didn\u2019t renew, they just didn\u2019t came up for renewal. And then the rest of it is just normal volatility and Q1 is particularly volatile, because it\u2019s typically our smallest quarter. It can have the highest standard deviation. The services per se wouldn\u2019t hit that fraud license line. It wouldn\u2019t hit the total fraud business. An example of a services engagement that we would deemphasize would be some managed services that we perform for some of our customers, where we are helping them run the application on an ongoing basis. We do it well. It\u2019s a good service. But it\u2019s not strategic and so we are not emphasizing that. We are also engineering our products to be less professional services intensive when they are installed. So they can reduce the total dollars that our customers need to spend to install the product. So those are two examples of how and why professional services are -- we expect to be trending downward over time.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Will, your comments around early signs of card, marketing, prospecting, et cetera, picking up. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit there on which particular areas perhaps and how we should, I guess, that probably just ties to the reopening, just curious to what you think there?\nWill Lansing: Well, I think, it is just that. I mean, we -- what we are seeing is the decline from a year earlier is not as great as it was. And so, while we clearly have a long way to go to kind of recover former volumes, the trend is in the right direction. So it\u2019s -- we are seeing early signs of life.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And just one last one for me, myFICO.com, I mean, I think, I understand why that\u2019s doing so well because of the market macro out there. But are you guys doing anything really differently in that business to push them grow to at least over 69% this quarter or\u2026\nWill Lansing: I think I\u2026\nManav Patnaik: \u2026 will set up for a big fall basically somewhere down the road.\nMike McLaughlin: Hard to say. I would say that it\u2019s a combination of us doing things differently, because we are always trying to do things that run the business better. And we have got a crack team there that is constantly experimenting and innovating to improve the business. But that said, obviously, we are benefiting from the fact that we have so many consumers who are increasingly focused on their Scores and their FICO credit scores. And they come to myFICO to where an obvious place to come. We don\u2019t promote it nearly as much as partners like experience. But consumers find us and we do some -- someone marketing ourselves. And so I\u2019d say it\u2019s both things. It\u2019s -- we are benefiting from the environment we are in where consumers are more focused than ever and I don\u2019t know how long that lasts. I think it could last a long time, but we don\u2019t know. And then we are also benefiting from an excellent execution from the team.\nManav Patnaik: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Kyle Peterson from Needham. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKyle Peterson: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I just wanted to touch a little bit on the expense and margin trajectory. Appreciate some of the color you guys mentioned on kind of reinvesting some of that as we go here. I mean, is it fair to think that some of the labor costs and savings you guys had this quarter will eventually be redeployed and maybe some of the savings of the facilities are kind of more permanent or how should we think about the cadence and level of this reinvestment?\nWill Lansing: Maybe I will just take a quick stab at that, and Mike, you can give your view. Some of those labor savings will absolutely be redeployed into areas that are more strategic. So we are -- we have very healthy investment in our decision management platform and so some of those savings will be redeployed there. I think that on the facilities and some of the travel reduction expenses that are COVID related, some of that\u2019s going to persist. I think some of that becomes permanent. Obviously travel, some amount of travel will resume, but I think we have all learned how to do business with less travel than we had before. And I mean, I am sure our experience is not unique. We have become a Zoom Video company, I mean we had it before COVID outbreak, but now it\u2019s a way of doing business. And so I would think that even when everything comes back, we won\u2019t see our travel expense at the same kind of level.\nMike McLaughlin: I add to that, Kyle, that we also, when everything comes back, won\u2019t see our real estate facilities expense go back to the same model. Those restructuring actions and footprint reductions are -- we consider them to be permanent. On the labor side, yes, we are redeploying as we have talked about some of the savings back into particularly engineering talent from our platform products and we are not guiding particularly exactly how that\u2019s going to move. But we did say last quarter and I continue to feel comfortable with, if you look at the full fiscal year, we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up a little bit, call it low single-digit percentages, we are still comfortable with that directionally.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just a little bit a follow up on the gross margins. It seems like you guys are kind of strategically exiting some lower margin businesses especially in the services side. I mean should that lead to maybe a slight upward bias to gross margins over time? I realize that some of that will be kind of mix driven between Scores and software. But all is equal I just want to get any color that you guys could provide on the gross margin impact on deemphasizing services and some of these other businesses?\nMike McLaughlin: All else equal\u2026\nWill Lansing: I don\u2019t think we have a lot of color -- go ahead, Mike.\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. I was just going to say your math directionally is right. All else equal, if we deliver less professional services, it\u2019s going to have a positive impact on gross margin, no question. The mix matters, for sure. But our professional services margins, gross margins are in line with what you would see at other well-run enterprise software companies that have in-house professional services and those margins are a lot lower than what typical software margins are.\nKyle Peterson: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Good quarter.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask a broader question about the platform strategy. Last quarter you talked about some good traction on that front. I was just wondering if you could provide any update on any other customer conversations and how should we think about the FICO Studio, how\u2019s that coming along in the open API strategy? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: The FICO Studio strategy is coming along just fine. We are on track. We have a quarterly release cycle and every quarter we make improvements. The API strategy is very much in place. We are very focused on that. We are also using the APIs internally today and we are in the process of turning those outward and documenting them so that others can use them. I actually think that the bigger hurdle for us will be around building a partner ecosystem that can leverage those APIs. So the -- getting the APIs out there is not something that we worry about. I think building the ecosystem takes a bit more work.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s very helpful color. And maybe just a follow-up question on the fraud piece -- the fraud solution piece. With this work-from-home, there\u2019s definitely increased traction for fraud and digital identity solutions. You are seeing increased demand in the marketplace. TransUnion and Equifax also announced certain products and Equifax announced Kount acquisition as well. I was just wondering if you can just talk about the demand that you are seeing in the marketplace, but also talk about the competitive environment for Falcon, obviously Falcon is the market you there on the financial side, but any change in the competitive environment there? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: We are not seeing tremendous changes. I mean Falcon is very much still the market leader and we are still selling Falcon in all its forms. So, we are not really seeing a difference there. I wouldn\u2019t say that demand is way up nor is it down for Falcon. What we are doing in the fraud spaces is also looking at some, I would call it less traditional fraud opportunities for us and leveraging the decision management platform for them. So some of the lower cost not as heavy duty as Falcon, but some of the other clients of Falcon -- some of the other kinds of fraud solutions will be coming on the platform.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Thank you. Hello, everyone. Will, I know that you said you are going to give us more detail next quarter on how the calendar \u201821 special pricing and B2B scores is feathering in. But just hoping you can confirm that four weeks in the execution of the special pricing implementation is going smoothly and as planned?\nWill Lansing: Everything is going as smoothly as expected. Everything is going as planned. It really -- it happens later and so we will talk about it later.\nJeff Meuler: Fair enough. And then on software, any more perspective you can provide on license and maintenance? And I understand what\u2019s going on from -- or I am sorry, for transaction and maintenance. And I understand what\u2019s going on from a license perspective, but for transaction and maintenance, applications down year-over-year and I know that\u2019s not usually a huge area of growth but it was down. And in DMS, it was, I guess, modest growth by DMS standards against what mathematically looks like not too tough of a comp.\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. There is not\u2026\nWill Lansing: Mike, do you want to take that?\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. A lot of the -- that is a category that is more usage-driven than fixed minimum-driven. It\u2019s not entirely usage, by any means. And we did see some usage fluctuations this quarter in some of our products, some of which would be -- seem to be related to the macro, like, we saw less usage of our origination solutions in a couple of spots and then there\u2019s normal variability in usage of things like fraud. Again some of that may be macro related and is less to credit card transactions or being processed so quickly. There is not a big story there. Again, I think, the big -- the bigger swing was just the license number overall, which was impacted, as described by the rev rec change and just the normal Q1 combined with just lower renewal paying as well.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then, Will, sorry to ask you to repeat yourself. But the mortgage comment in your prepared remarks, was it just that mortgage is seasonally a smaller percentage of the mix this quarter?\nWill Lansing: The mortgage\u2026\nMike McLaughlin: I think. Yeah. Go ahead, Will.\nWill Lansing: Well, I am just going it\u2019s -- mortgage holding up fine actually and so it\u2019s -- for now it looks right.\nJeff Meuler: Right. I guess Equifax reported a mortgage inquiry should actually accelerate a little bit this quarter and I thought you had a comment that something related to mortgage. It almost like it was a lesser benefit than I just didn\u2019t know if that was just seasonal mix or what you were saying and maybe I just misheard you?\nWill Lansing: No. I don\u2019t -- maybe I need to go consult my notes. I think that we don\u2019t really opine on the future mortgage. You are better off looking to the bureaus and their forecasts than to us, because we are kind of a lagging indicator on that. But what we see and at least what we are seeing right now is strong mortgage.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah. Got you. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Brett Huff with Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrett Huff: Good afternoon, Will, Mike, and Steve. I hope you are all safe. Thanks for taking the question. Two big -- two bigger picture ones. We have been watching DMS for a long time and still think it\u2019s a really important long-term strategic product. And I think, Will, you have talked about your commitment to that. And last quarter we had I think a big Brazilian bank that kind of win an enterprise on that. Anything in the pipeline similar to that or conversation that you can give us anecdotally, any sort of signs that this is -- this wave is starting to build a little bit?\nWill Lansing: Yeah. I think it\u2019s too early to talk about specifics, but we have a lot of DMS opportunities in the pipeline and various interests from large financial institutions. And so without being able get into specifics right now, I would say, that it is consuming a lot of our sales activity.\nBrett Huff: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the second question is on margins, I know that we have been working through sort of enhancing our tech kind of infrastructure and then spending a lot of money on DMS and some of the SaaS application if you will, the platform solution. I know that we have talked about the potential margin benefit from that. But I know we are kind of running in a little bit to the rev rec change and some other things maybe exiting some businesses. Can you sort of give us a sense this year and next year, not numbers but just how we should think about margin benefits and headwinds as we look to see the business start expanding margins maybe a little more rapidly? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: The margins -- it -- we have pulling and pushing in two directions. The margins are improving because we are getting better on expenses. W are -- our mix is changing with less PS. We are reviewing our products and identifying the ones that really aren\u2019t contributing enough and are not strategic and so we talked about the China and ESS for example. But set against that is this incredible opportunity that we see with DMP or the Decision Management Platform. And we work through year-by-year what we can afford to spend on investing in it, but it\u2019s not trivial. And given the market opportunity we are not going to shortchange it. So I think some of the margin improvement will be consumed by that incremental investment. Now, which way that goes? I know you are looking for a direction. Are margins getting better? Are they getting worse? Are they going sideways? We are just not prepared to say it yet. Flat is probably a good way to think about it. But I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock in that because it could move. It really is a constant press internally for us to improve margins from an operating standpoint with cost reduction with getting better on pods all those kinds of things, while at the same time, recognizing that we are not going to miss this opportunity within the platform.\nBrett Huff: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And we have a follow up question from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you for the follow-up question. A quick question on kind of the M&A front, you talked a little bit earlier about kind of fine tuning some of the businesses that you are in and being a little bit more focused. Is there an opportunity for M&A within that or has anything potentially changed there that we can think about or any needs that you might have?\nWill Lansing: I don\u2019t think a lot has changed. You know that our stance on M&A is we are always open and looking and we rarely find anything significant that makes sense for us. And the issue -- especially given our platform strategy, the issue is that, introducing business, other businesses with other code bases that we just have to be put on a path to be brought into our platform. It is a -- it\u2019s just a little bit complicated and potentially our strategy. So while we are always looking, it makes more sense for us at this time to continue to invest organically and build organically. Now that said, we are always doing small acquisitions, typically talent acquisition, sometimes small technology acquisitions that fill little gaps. But in terms of large acquisitions, I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath, but never say never it could happen, but it\u2019s not imminent.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s very helpful. And then one other quick question. There were a lot of questions in kind of the bookings numbers and you guys provided some color on the seasonality component and how the first fiscal quarter is generally the weakest. Is there anything else, I mean, when I look back that number was actually the lowest that I have on record for you guys in the past three plus years. And so is there anything there to read into other than just the lumpiness in the sense that maybe clients are hesitating a little bit, is there maybe a little bit of uncertainty? What are those client dialogues or is it just clients are waiting for more of the DMS platform and maybe if you can talk about the roadmap for the DMS platform over the next year?\nWill Lansing: I will take a stab and Mike can chime in. I think that the bookings, there is -- there are other changes going on. So for example, term length has shrunk a bit. That\u2019s by design. It\u2019s because we would rather have a renewal sooner than have it pushed way out, because we think there will be opportunities to do better down the line. So -- and that\u2019s reflected in the sales compensation. It\u2019s reflected in the fact that, meaning that our sales people are now compensated on kind of the annual recurring revenue as opposed to the full bookings value and that has a natural impact on internally. So I would say that\u2019s one factor. I would also say, I am not sure it\u2019s the right. I mean obviously we have been promoting it as a metric for ourselves for a long time and we are not going to stop sharing it. But I do think that over time we have to really start to focus on our business on this kind of annual recurring basis. Mike, do you want to add anything to that?\nMike McLaughlin: Yeah. I\u2019d say that it does, look, it doesn\u2019t feel like there is a COIVD or otherwise systemic hesitancy on the part of customers. You never can tell for sure. But the pipeline is still feels good. As we said, we still feel good about the full year on a new business basis and we came off of the highest ever booking quarter as you know in Q4 into what is seasonally the slowest quarter. So it\u2019s -- again we don\u2019t think that what you are thinking about is the case, time will tell. But the indicators we see is that the pipeline continues to look good for the year.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s very helpful. And then one kind of final question here, just the roadmap for the DMS platform over the next year?\nWill Lansing: Yeah. I am not sure what we are prepared to disclose about the roadmap. We continue to make progress on Studio and we continue to work hard against getting the APIs turned outward, and I would say, those are the big points.\nSurinder Thind: Okay. Thank you so much, guys. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nWill Lansing: Thank you. This includes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s call. Participant please -- thank you for your participation and please disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Mike McLaughlin",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our first quarter results in more detail and briefly discuss the impact we are seeing from the restructuring and impairment charges we took in the fall and the revenue recognition assumptions we talked about last quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $312 million, an increase of 5% over the prior year. Our applications revenues were $135 million, down 11% versus the same period last year. This quarterly decrease in revenue was primarily driven by decreased term license revenues. In our Decision Management Software segment, Q1 revenues were $32 million, up 4% over the same period last year. The revenue increase was due to increased SaaS subscription revenue partially offset by lower license revenues. As Will mentioned, our license revenues are down as we transition to a more ratable subscription revenue model. Last quarter we explained how we would be recognizing less of our on-premise software deals upfront license revenue and recognizing more revenue ratably over the term of the deal. In addition to this change we are also selling more SaaS deals which further reduces the upfront revenues. Finally, we are also deemphasizing a low margin of non-strategic professional services engagement, which will likely have a negative near-term impact on professional services bookings and revenues. This is driven by our core strategic goal of selling more high value recurring revenue software. Turning to our Score segment, revenues were $145 million, up 26% from the same period last year. B2B revenues were up 20% over the same period last year, driven by high volumes in mortgage originations, as well as some unit price increases across our Score categories. B2C revenues were up 40% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and B2C partner revenues grew significantly. Score's revenue was down 5% sequentially from Q4, but as a reminder, last quarter we had a material onetime royalty true-up that increased reporting revenue. This quarter 80% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 14% and then the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Recurring revenues derived from transactional and maintenance sources for the quarter represented 81% of total revenues. Consulting and implementation services revenues were 13% of total revenues and license revenues were 6% of total revenue. SaaS software revenues not including related professional services revenues were $60 million for the quarter, up 4% from the previous year. Q1 bookings totaled $68 million, down 39% from the previous year. Those bookings generated $9 million of current period revenues, a 13% deal. SaaS bookings were $20 million for the quarter, down 45% from the previous year. Professional services bookings of $16 million were down 61% from last year. Our fiscal first quarter bookings are generally lower each year, particularly after a strong quarter like we delivered last quarter and our quarterly bookings can be quite volatile from quarter-to-quarter. We feel good about the bookings outlook for the rest of the fiscal year despite the relatively light bookings in Q1. However, it is important to note that we do expect bookings to trend lower overall as a result of our deemphasize on professional services sales and the somewhat shorter term lack of typical SaaS contracts. As we discussed last quarter, we have shifted the sales of our on-premise software away from the sale of separate license and maintenance components to subscriptions that include both the rights to use the software and ongoing maintenance. This quarter, we adjusted our revenue recognition to be consistent with this change and industry standards for software subscription sales. This change results in less upfront revenue recognized in the quarter we signed a subscription contract and more revenue from that contract recognized ratably during the term of the subscription. This quarter, the impact of this change was an in-quarter reduction of revenue of approximately $9 million. Those are revenues that would have been claimed this quarter under the old sales model and will now be recognized over the term of the contract. As a reminder, this will not have an impact on our quarterly cash flows or the total revenue recognized from software license sales over the term of each subscription contract. Our operating expenses totaled $218 million this quarter, compared to $289 million in the prior quarter. The current quarter included a $7 million gain on sale of product line assets and the prior quarter included $42 million of restructuring and impairment charges. Excluding those one-time charges, expenses were down $22 million due to decreased commission expenses associated with lower revenue, reduced incentive expenses and cost savings resulting from the restructuring actions we took last September. Compared to Q1 2020, operating expenses before one-time events were down $14 million, due to decreased marketing expenses resulting from a large customer event held in Q1 2020, lower travel and entertainment expense and cost savings resulting from our Q4 2020 restructuring. We do expect expenses to step up somewhat in the coming quarters and as we gradually redeploy the restructuring savings to add strategic headcount, primarily related to the development of our Decision Management Platform Software. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 36% for the quarter and margin expansion of 900 basis points from the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter with $86 million up 57% from the prior year quarter and included a gain of about $7 million from the sale of our EFS types technology and our JV agreement in China. Our non-GAAP net income was $82 million for the quarter, up 51% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 2%, including $19 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits. We expect our FY 2021 recurrent tax rate to be approximately 26% to 27% and we expect the net effective tax rate for the year to be about 19%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $75 million, compared to $54 million in the same period last year, an increase of 39%. For the trailing four quarters free cash flow was $364 million. Turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter we had $145 million in cash, down $13 million from last quarter. Our total debt now stands at $881 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2%. And finally return of capital, we bought back 101,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $494 per share. At the end of December, we had about $175 million remaining on the Board repurchase authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his closing thoughts. Yeah. I can jump in with some specific. So B2C revenues were up quarter-over-quarter, but not a lot, call it, $1 million. If you look back to Q4 to Q1, a year ago, it was kind of the same factor. So there is some seasonality Q4 to Q1 and the year-over-year compare continues to be very strong. But you are right, the quarter over quarter additions just were not as large as they were in the last two quarters particularly. Yeah. Sure. So... ...if you look at the license -- yeah. Manav, if you look at the license itself. As we said, it's -- and I am not just address fraud because probably the bigger question is that we are down about $15 million year-over-year from license sales. As we said about $9 million of that was purely related to the revenue recognition sale. It was also a quarter where we had less license renewals available to renew. If you followed us long enough then you know that that can be very lumpy. In Q3 we had another low quarter of last year, but Q2 was high. It just goes up and down. We can only renew that which is available. So it was a low renewal quarter. Not that we missed renewals or people didn't renew, they just didn't came up for renewal. And then the rest of it is just normal volatility and Q1 is particularly volatile, because it's typically our smallest quarter. It can have the highest standard deviation. The services per se wouldn't hit that fraud license line. It wouldn't hit the total fraud business. An example of a services engagement that we would deemphasize would be some managed services that we perform for some of our customers, where we are helping them run the application on an ongoing basis. We do it well. It's a good service. But it's not strategic and so we are not emphasizing that. We are also engineering our products to be less professional services intensive when they are installed. So they can reduce the total dollars that our customers need to spend to install the product. So those are two examples of how and why professional services are -- we expect to be trending downward over time. Hard to say. I would say that it's a combination of us doing things differently, because we are always trying to do things that run the business better. And we have got a crack team there that is constantly experimenting and innovating to improve the business. But that said, obviously, we are benefiting from the fact that we have so many consumers who are increasingly focused on their Scores and their FICO credit scores. And they come to myFICO to where an obvious place to come. We don't promote it nearly as much as partners like experience. But consumers find us and we do some -- someone marketing ourselves. And so I'd say it's both things. It's -- we are benefiting from the environment we are in where consumers are more focused than ever and I don't know how long that lasts. I think it could last a long time, but we don't know. And then we are also benefiting from an excellent execution from the team. I add to that, Kyle, that we also, when everything comes back, won't see our real estate facilities expense go back to the same model. Those restructuring actions and footprint reductions are -- we consider them to be permanent. On the labor side, yes, we are redeploying as we have talked about some of the savings back into particularly engineering talent from our platform products and we are not guiding particularly exactly how that's going to move. But we did say last quarter and I continue to feel comfortable with, if you look at the full fiscal year, we expect our operating expenses to be flat to up a little bit, call it low single-digit percentages, we are still comfortable with that directionally. All else equal... Yeah. I was just going to say your math directionally is right. All else equal, if we deliver less professional services, it's going to have a positive impact on gross margin, no question. The mix matters, for sure. But our professional services margins, gross margins are in line with what you would see at other well-run enterprise software companies that have in-house professional services and those margins are a lot lower than what typical software margins are. Yeah. There is not... Yeah. A lot of the -- that is a category that is more usage-driven than fixed minimum-driven. It's not entirely usage, by any means. And we did see some usage fluctuations this quarter in some of our products, some of which would be -- seem to be related to the macro, like, we saw less usage of our origination solutions in a couple of spots and then there's normal variability in usage of things like fraud. Again some of that may be macro related and is less to credit card transactions or being processed so quickly. There is not a big story there. Again, I think, the big -- the bigger swing was just the license number overall, which was impacted, as described by the rev rec change and just the normal Q1 combined with just lower renewal paying as well. I think. Yeah. Go ahead, Will. Yeah. I'd say that it does, look, it doesn't feel like there is a COIVD or otherwise systemic hesitancy on the part of customers. You never can tell for sure. But the pipeline is still feels good. As we said, we still feel good about the full year on a new business basis and we came off of the highest ever booking quarter as you know in Q4 into what is seasonally the slowest quarter. So it's -- again we don't think that what you are thinking about is the case, time will tell. But the indicators we see is that the pipeline continues to look good for the year."

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining our first quarter earnings call. As we continue to deal with the effects of the pandemic, we remain focused on the health and safety of our employees. We are still primarily working from home and most of our offices remain closed. I am grateful to our dedicated employees who every day show their commitment to FICO and to our customers. On the Investor Relations section of our website we have posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our first quarter. I am pleased to say, we started 2021 well, as we continue to make progress on our strategic initiatives. We have reported revenues of $312 million, an increase of 5% over the same period last year. We are pleased with that result because we knew we would have headwinds on the software side as we transition toward more ratable recognition of our subscription software license revenues and our first fiscal quarter is typically our slowest software new business quarter. We delivered $86 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $2.90 per share, up 57% and 59%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis net income was $82 million, up 51% and earnings per share of $2.74 was up 52% from last year, as we reap the benefits of the cost reductions we put in place last year. As we discussed last quarter, some of those savings will be reinvested as we identify opportunities and hire additional individuals in key strategic areas. We continue to deliver free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $75 million, up 39% from last year. I am encouraged by the progress we are making across the business. The decisioning market continues to grow and we are well-positioned to serve it. In fact, in December, Forrester issued a Digital Decisioning Platform report and named FICO as a leader in space. The FICO Decision Management Platform was recognized for providing all the tools necessary to manage and deploy digital decisions, which will stand up to the highest standard of regulatory rigor. We have been helping financial institutions make lending decisions for decades. We now bring that same level of automated analyst decisioning to the broader market to help businesses respond quickly to customers' needs and anticipate their future demands. As we migrate more of our business toward a subscription based model including SaaS software subscriptions and term license subscriptions for on-prem software. We will see less upfront license revenue than we would have in the past as the revenue spread over the term of the deal. Last quarter we talked about how we would recognize less revenue upfront for on-premise licenses and that change pushed about $9 million of revenue this quarter out to future quarters. This doesn't affect cash flows or total revenues recognized but it does delay the timing of revenues and over time will smooth the lumpiness we have historically seen. This changes in line with industry standards and we believe it will provide a more representative transparent view of the growth trajectory of our business. In our Application segment, we delivered $135 million revenue, down 11% from last year. This was due to a decline in upfront license revenues into a lesser extent professional services revenues. The license revenue was negatively affected by a smaller amount of term licenses upfront through renewal in the quarter and the revenue recognition change I mentioned earlier. In our Decision Management segment, we delivered $32 million of revenue, up 4%, despite many of the same issues we described in our Application segment. Our license revenue declined versus the previous year, transactional revenues in DMS were up 36%, providing the steady predictable recurring revenue stream that we believe will continue to grow. We have had a lot of interest in our decisioning platform and we sold a number of large deals in the best few quarters. We are working hard to install and get those customers live, so you can begin seeing the impacts from those recurring revenues. As I have often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. This is the strategic focus of our software business. And like I said last quarter that may mean exiting non-strategic products or services, we are not signing or renewing low margin services led project work. Last fall, we sold our Enterprise Security Score business, because although we believe the effectiveness and value of the product is off strategy and need to remain incredibly focused to maximize the opportunity that's in front of us. In December, we entered into a joint venture with a longstanding partner in China that distributes FICO Scores. And the joint venture will now distribute all software solutions for the China market. Moving forward, this will allow us to serve that market with less infrastructure and therefore a better margins. So this and the ESS deal will have a small near-term negative impact on topline revenues, but will help our overall margins and again allow us to focus on our overarching strategy. We expect more adjustments to be made of our software business as we make the necessary decisions to pursue our strategic initiatives. On the Scores side, the business continues to reform very well. Scores were up 26% in the quarter versus the prior year. On the B2B side revenues were up 20%. There was continued strength in mortgage originations volumes, although normal seasonality wasn't quite as strong as our fourth quarter. Auto originations were relatively flat versus the previous year. We are starting to see signs of cards and other unsecured loans beginning to bounce back, as both prescreen and origination activities picked up in that space. As we discussed last quarter we did institute some price increases across various volunteers. Those price increases start to feather in during our second quarter and we can talk more about those impacts when we release the results of our March quarter. On the consumer side, we continue to drive growth. Our B2C revenues were up 40% versus same quarter last year. The growth at myFICO.com is even more impressive up 69% this quarter versus last year. The recent results of our myFICO business, as well as our partner's experience, demonstrate that savvy consumers want the FICO Score, the Scores that lenders use. Finally, as you know, we haven't provided guidance since the middle of our last fiscal year. We are still operating in a marketplace in the economy with a great deal of uncertainty and volatility. While our business has been remarkably resilient over the past year, it's still difficult to quantify what macro trends will impact our volumes. So while we are confident in our prospects this year, we still believe that there's a wide range of possible outcomes depending on the timing of vaccine rollout and the opening back up of the global economy. As we move through the year, we will provide more color than we believe it is prudent. I will give final comments in a few minutes, but first let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we remain focused on building out our platform and taking it to an ever expanding marketplace. We will continue to invest at levels we think are appropriate to make the most of our incredible opportunity, and of course, we will continue to innovate and make the most of our incredible Scores asset. I am now turning the call over to Steve for Q&A. I am not sure I follow the question. That's right. It didn't appear this quarter. Mike, go ahead. And it's worth adding that there was a settlement in the prior quarter. I would say, from a strategy standpoint, the way -- we don't emphasize the one business over the other. We really try to do what's appropriate for the customer. And so, while we love the characteristics of the SaaS business, where appropriate, we will absolutely do license on-prem deals and we don't favor -- we don't really favor one over the other. Mike, do you have a view on that? Well, I think, it is just that. I mean, we -- what we are seeing is the decline from a year earlier is not as great as it was. And so, while we clearly have a long way to go to kind of recover former volumes, the trend is in the right direction. So it's -- we are seeing early signs of life. I think I... Maybe I will just take a quick stab at that, and Mike, you can give your view. Some of those labor savings will absolutely be redeployed into areas that are more strategic. So we are -- we have very healthy investment in our decision management platform and so some of those savings will be redeployed there. I think that on the facilities and some of the travel reduction expenses that are COVID related, some of that's going to persist. I think some of that becomes permanent. Obviously travel, some amount of travel will resume, but I think we have all learned how to do business with less travel than we had before. And I mean, I am sure our experience is not unique. We have become a Zoom Video company, I mean we had it before COVID outbreak, but now it's a way of doing business. And so I would think that even when everything comes back, we won't see our travel expense at the same kind of level. I don't think we have a lot of color -- go ahead, Mike. The FICO Studio strategy is coming along just fine. We are on track. We have a quarterly release cycle and every quarter we make improvements. The API strategy is very much in place. We are very focused on that. We are also using the APIs internally today and we are in the process of turning those outward and documenting them so that others can use them. I actually think that the bigger hurdle for us will be around building a partner ecosystem that can leverage those APIs. So the -- getting the APIs out there is not something that we worry about. I think building the ecosystem takes a bit more work. We are not seeing tremendous changes. I mean Falcon is very much still the market leader and we are still selling Falcon in all its forms. So, we are not really seeing a difference there. I wouldn't say that demand is way up nor is it down for Falcon. What we are doing in the fraud spaces is also looking at some, I would call it less traditional fraud opportunities for us and leveraging the decision management platform for them. So some of the lower cost not as heavy duty as Falcon, but some of the other clients of Falcon -- some of the other kinds of fraud solutions will be coming on the platform. Everything is going as smoothly as expected. Everything is going as planned. It really -- it happens later and so we will talk about it later. Mike, do you want to take that? The mortgage... Well, I am just going it's -- mortgage holding up fine actually and so it's -- for now it looks right. No. I don't -- maybe I need to go consult my notes. I think that we don't really opine on the future mortgage. You are better off looking to the bureaus and their forecasts than to us, because we are kind of a lagging indicator on that. But what we see and at least what we are seeing right now is strong mortgage. Yeah. I think it's too early to talk about specifics, but we have a lot of DMS opportunities in the pipeline and various interests from large financial institutions. And so without being able get into specifics right now, I would say, that it is consuming a lot of our sales activity. The margins -- it -- we have pulling and pushing in two directions. The margins are improving because we are getting better on expenses. W are -- our mix is changing with less PS. We are reviewing our products and identifying the ones that really aren't contributing enough and are not strategic and so we talked about the China and ESS for example. But set against that is this incredible opportunity that we see with DMP or the Decision Management Platform. And we work through year-by-year what we can afford to spend on investing in it, but it's not trivial. And given the market opportunity we are not going to shortchange it. So I think some of the margin improvement will be consumed by that incremental investment. Now, which way that goes? I know you are looking for a direction. Are margins getting better? Are they getting worse? Are they going sideways? We are just not prepared to say it yet. Flat is probably a good way to think about it. But I wouldn't put a lot of stock in that because it could move. It really is a constant press internally for us to improve margins from an operating standpoint with cost reduction with getting better on pods all those kinds of things, while at the same time, recognizing that we are not going to miss this opportunity within the platform. I don't think a lot has changed. You know that our stance on M&A is we are always open and looking and we rarely find anything significant that makes sense for us. And the issue -- especially given our platform strategy, the issue is that, introducing business, other businesses with other code bases that we just have to be put on a path to be brought into our platform. It is a -- it's just a little bit complicated and potentially our strategy. So while we are always looking, it makes more sense for us at this time to continue to invest organically and build organically. Now that said, we are always doing small acquisitions, typically talent acquisition, sometimes small technology acquisitions that fill little gaps. But in terms of large acquisitions, I wouldn't hold my breath, but never say never it could happen, but it's not imminent. I will take a stab and Mike can chime in. I think that the bookings, there is -- there are other changes going on. So for example, term length has shrunk a bit. That's by design. It's because we would rather have a renewal sooner than have it pushed way out, because we think there will be opportunities to do better down the line. So -- and that's reflected in the sales compensation. It's reflected in the fact that, meaning that our sales people are now compensated on kind of the annual recurring revenue as opposed to the full bookings value and that has a natural impact on internally. So I would say that's one factor. I would also say, I am not sure it's the right. I mean obviously we have been promoting it as a metric for ourselves for a long time and we are not going to stop sharing it. But I do think that over time we have to really start to focus on our business on this kind of annual recurring basis. Mike, do you want to add anything to that? Yeah. I am not sure what we are prepared to disclose about the roadmap. We continue to make progress on Studio and we continue to work hard against getting the APIs turned outward, and I would say, those are the big points. Thank you. This includes today's call. Thank you all for joining and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you and have a good day."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Wednesday, November 9, 2022. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the Company's business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and the Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 9, 2023. And now, I will turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve. And thank you everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that we had a very good quarter which completed an outstanding year with record revenues, record earnings, and record cash flows. We easily exceeded our guidance in all areas even after a mid-year raise. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $349 million in fourth quarter and $1.38 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We delivered $91 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3.55 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $374 million of GAAP net income and $14.18 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million and earnings per share were $4.40. Full year non-GAAP net income was $454 million, up 19% over last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.22 was up 32% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $144 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $503 million up 21% from the previous year. Our strong cash flow allowed us to be especially aggressive in returning capital to shareholders through our share buybacks. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased nearly 2.7 million shares at an average price of $409 per share. In our Software segment, we delivered $175 million of revenue, up 5% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9% and the platform ARR grew 52%. We continued to deliver strong NRR as well, demonstrating our land and expand strategy as customers increase their total usage. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8 was 107%. Platform NRR was 128% and we continue to see strong demand for our technology from new customers. Our ACV bookings as shown on Page 9, were up 14% over last year. We continue to focus on our state-of-the-art FICO platform, it truly is NextGen decisioning technology. It allows customers to use advanced analytics to optimize interactions with their consumers. In our Scores segment, we're seeing a continuation of the trend for the last several quarters. Mortgage originations have continued to decline and in Q4 accounted for just 11% of our Scores revenue and 5% of total company revenues. Auto originations revenues remained relatively stable with originations flat with last quarter and up 20% versus last year, primarily due to pricing. Card and personal loan originations continue to perform well with originations revenues up 37% over last year. Total Scores revenues were up 3% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 8% for the full year as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 6% in both the quarter and for the full year. This is a strong result considering the rapid and dramatic rise of interest rates and their impact on the mortgage market. On the B2C side, revenues were down 3% in the quarter due to a slowdown in new customer subscriptions on our myFICO platform and up 11% for the full year. I will discuss next year's guidance in greater detail later where we expect the Scores business to grow about 7%. We also expect the special pricing initiatives for 2023 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers consistent with those over the last several years. Although it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Finally, as you are aware, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have completed their validation and approval of new credit score models. I'm pleased the process has concluded and that the FICO Scores has again been approved for using conforming mortgages by the enterprises. This decision means that FICO Score 10T will be required to be used when available, as classic FICO is today for each conforming mortgage delivered to the enterprises. The latest release of our flagship FICO score, FICO Score 10T delivers increased predictive power while preserving the trusted and proven FICO score minimum scoring criteria. These improvements in predictive power can help mortgage lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates. The decision from the FHFA is the culmination of a multiyear process set out by both congressional and administrative regulation. We look forward to additional guidance from the FHFA and the enterprises on the timeline and the implementation process. I'm also pleased to report that in our fourth quarter we signed a multi-year extension with the large bureau partner in the consumer Scores space. I have some final comments and provide our fiscal '23 guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As Will summarized we had another exceptional fiscal year and we are pleased with our momentum as we head into fiscal 2023. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $349 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.38 billion was up 5% over last year and up 8% when adjusted for the divestitures we completed in fiscal 2021. In our Scores segment, revenues for the quarter were $174 million, up 3% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 6% with growth in our auto scores and credit card and personal loans scores more than compensating for continued declines in mortgage score revenues. Our B2C revenue was down 3% from the same period last year, due primarily to the impact of fewer new subscribers on our myFICO.com platform, a trend we highlighted on last quarter's earnings call. For the full year, Scores revenues were $707 million up 8% from last year despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage origination space. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $175 million, up 5% versus the same period last year. Full year software revenues were $671 million, up 1% from the previous year and up 9% after adjusting for our 2021 divestitures. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which includes both North America and Latin America. Our EMEA region generated 11% and 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Our Software ARR at the end of the fourth quarter was $569 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $114 million, representing 20% of our total fourth quarter ARR, and a growth rate of 52% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 107% overall, our non-platform customer's software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 100%. Our platform customers are showing a very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 128% in the fourth quarter versus 143% in the prior year. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $30 million versus $26 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $86 million versus $63 million in FY '21. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of new software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $215 million this quarter versus $219 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2022, our expenses benefited from a number of factors, including savings from divested businesses, headcount reduction actions taken at the end of FY '21, somewhat elevated employee attrition, and significant operational efficiencies achieved in our software segment. While we will continue our focus on expense efficiency in fiscal 2023, we expect our total expenses to trend up modestly in the coming year. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 47% for the quarter and 48% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 800 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $91 million up 6% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter and materially consistent with the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $374 million compared with $392 million last year. As a reminder, last year's GAAP net income included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestitures. GAAP net income for fiscal 2022 was $454 million up 19% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 21% including $9 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%, that expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% in FY '23. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $503 million up 21% from last year's $416 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $159 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.85 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. As you recall, we issued $550 million in senior notes last December, locking in a fixed rate of 4%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is pre-payable at any time giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances if it is financially advantageous for us to do so in future periods. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 120,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $468 per share. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 2,678,000 shares at an average price of $409 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. The Board approved a new $500 million authorization in October and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY '23.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As we enter our fiscal 2023, I'm excited about our prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. We have an incredible set of assets and a business model that can produce predictable solid results even in a turbulent macro environment. Our FICO platform continues to experience phenomenal growth as we find a receptive audience for best-in-class decisioning that our panelists deliver. Our Scores business continues to deliver industry-standard risk management products that are especially critical in uncertain economic times. And the recent FHFA decision ensures that we'll be a critical component in the mortgage process for many years to come. The successful deal signings we had in fiscal '22, as well as prudent planning and management, give us confidence, we will have another successful year in fiscal '23. We are providing full year guidance as shown on the presentation. Regarding revenues of approximately $1.475 billion, an increase of 7% versus fiscal 22. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $401 million, an increase of 7.5%. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $16, an increase of 13%. Non-GAAP net income of $487 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $19.42, increases of 7.5% and 13% respectively. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve and we'll take questions.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSam Salvas: This is actually Sam Salvas on for Kyle today. Thanks for taking the questions, and nice results here. I wanted to start out on the software side of the business. It seems like things are still going well here. But wanted to get a sense if you guys could talk a little bit more about demand here, maybe specifically on the international side, are you guys seen any deals get pushed out or any deals being downsized given the current macro environment?\nWill Lansing: We are not seeing deals pushed out nor are we seeing deals downsized. It's probably worth noting that we have a fairly long sales cycle, it's approximately a year long. And so it's long enough in our view. But we have not seen softness. No, I think that the current solutions and offerings particularly around the platform are really strategic. And the - and our customers see them that way and it's a higher-level decision. And so whatever financial pressure our customers may be under, our deals with them seem not to be affected.\nSam Salvas: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. I was wondering if you guys could talk a little bit more about the volumes you guys have been seeing on the Scores side of the business, as far as the different segments? And maybe talk a little bit about how you guys are feeling about credit card and mortgage, auto as we head into 2023? Thanks.\nMike McLaughlin: Hi, Sam, it's Mike. As in past quarters, we don't disclose volumes precisely. But also as in past quarters, I can tell you that the volumes we saw are pretty consistent with what you have seen if you've been watching the third-party data out there from either the NBA or J.D. Power or credit card issuers themselves. Mortgage has declined for us in volume in a quantity consistent with what you can see from some of those data points. Auto was more or less flat both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, again consistent with external reporting. And on the credit card side, growth continued to be strong on a year-over-year basis. It was more or less flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis but consistent with the market. In terms of how we feel going forward, we don't make predictions about volumes in those sectors, we don't have economists that don't necessarily consider ourselves experts in forecasting that kind of consumer behavior. But I think you can have some confidence that our volumes will pretty much track the overall market as it has in past quarters.\nOperator: Next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Mazzoni: This is John filling in for Ashish. Maybe just a follow-up on the ACV bookings, 14% was very strong. Is there anything that's driving that strength or is this more of seasonal element? Thanks.\nMike McLaughlin: Well, we have a lot of quarter-to-quarter variability in the ACV bookings as you can see from our data. And our ACV bookings tend to be fourth quarter weighted. This year was a little less fourth quarter weighted than the last year. So I would encourage you to look at the year - at the full year comparison, not so much the quarter-over quarter because one quarter doesn't make a trend. Our year-over-year growth in ACV bookings as we talked about over 30%, and it reflects the underlying strength in a variety of areas of our business, our platform business, our customer communication business, as well. And the guidance that we have for next year is not heroic in terms of the amount of new ACV bookings we need to deliver relative to the past year.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great. Thank you. And then maybe just quickly, could you give us some more color on the slow-down in marketing, and as well as the shift to freemium and how it's weighed on B2C? And perhaps how we could think about B2C revenue growth going forward? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: Yes. What do you mean by slowdown in marketing?\nJohn Mazzoni: So just based on some of our math, it looks like we might have a slowdown in marketing and account management, but we might be a bit off there. Is that the case?\nMike McLaughlin: Okay. So you're talking about the Scores side of the business and sale of our Scores used for marketing or pre-screening purposes, is that correct?\nJohn Mazzoni: Yes. That would be great.\nMike McLaughlin: Okay. Got you. Yes, as with last quarter, we've seen a flattening of the growth in the sale of that type of Score, the pre-screening of pre-score sale. In fact. it was down a little bit this quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we do think it's somewhat of a leading indicator as to how much credit particularly credit card and personal loan, credit lenders want to extend in future periods. We've never analyzed precisely how predictive it is consistent with what we're seeing in the macro, the demand for that kind of a score was down a little bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrendan Popson: This is Brendan on for Manav. Just wanted to ask on guidance. 7% growth for Scores. Obviously, didn't quite you have this quarter and there is some macro - certainly more macro concerns for next year. You talk about flattening in marketing and that can be a leading indicator. It seems like there are some negatives, but at the same time, it's pretty good - it's a pretty good, pre-year guidance, and, of course, that doesn't include pricing. So I guess what gives you the confidence for that and whether the puts and takes driving that 7%?\nWill Lansing: Yes, good question. So just starting with the special pricing. The special pricing is in addition to our guidance, it's not in that 7% exactly. It's really - think of it as being consistent with past years and outside of our guidance because we can't really predict the timing and so on. With respect to within the guidance, the 7%, we have a fairly significant CPI increase there which in years past has been there as well but it was always a much smaller number. This year we're talking about a reasonably significant number which is driving a fair bit of that. And also, I would say that mortgages it's a smaller piece of our business. And so we feel pretty good about the overall mix.\nBrendan Popson: Okay. And then looking at how that translates down to the bottom line, pretty good EPS number. Is there - is it - could you comment any on margins or I guess you guys have commented on expenses. But is it just you expect a strong flow through and or is there something else contemplated, it seem like the EPS was a good amount above net income and I don't know if it's that - like the growth rate. I don't know if that's just from the repurchases in the back half of this year or if you can detail about that.\nWill Lansing: It's a bit of both. I mean so, we're clearly holding the line on expenses, but it's also a smaller share count, they're both contributors.\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. I mean, just to add to that. We expect to grow revenues faster than expenses, it's kind of that simple. And we have reduced share count by such a degree that the EPS growth is going to be faster than net income growth.\nBrendan Popson: Okay. And there is no - are there any repurchases assumed in '23 in that number?\nWill Lansing: Yes. We anticipate repurchasing shares at a pace more or less consistent with our free cash flow generation for the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Following up on the - perhaps the first question that was asked about the demand environment in software. Can you provide any color in terms of the new conversations that you might be having with clients given that the sales cycle is long obviously, there is an ability to kind of take advantage of that linked period. But what about new conversations? Are you able to kind of bring new clients to the table to start those conversations? Or how should we be thinking about that part of the pipeline - \nWill Lansing: Yes. We absolutely are. So we think of our target market as the top 200 financial institutions globally. And our penetration there is around 15%, little over 30 customers signed through the platform. And so our conversation takes two forms. One is, let's talk to the other 85% of our target market that has not yet signed up for the platform, as well as expansion opportunities with the ones who already have. And both of those kind of conversations are going on, and very successfully.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the B2C piece, any additional color you can provide there in terms of - it sounds like, the weakness I guess within the myFICO.com parts. Any color on how the revenues are trending within your relationship partner?\nWill Lansing: So consumer B2C does have - does move in sympathy with mortgage volumes because as you know consumers tend to sign-up for that kind of subscription, with contemplating mortgages when they are wondering what their FICO score is going to be for them when they go out and get financing. So as mortgage volumes go down so to - with a little bit of a lag with so to do our B2C myFICO volumes. Our volumes are - they're good, they're down a little bit, they're good. And same with our partners, our partners are - they're doing okay.\nSurinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just, when we kind of breakdown the guidance on - into kind of the Scores and suffer for next year, it looks like you're looking for about roughly equal growth. You've talked about the CPI component. Is there also an anticipation of just volume growth here or how should we think about the mix at this point in terms of - it seems like right now card remains quite strong and you can argue that auto is probably near trough, so maybe there is improvement there. But how are you generally - what kind of an environment is kind of baked into those assumptions? Is it just a little bit of a continuation of what we're currently seeing or how should we think about the various macro factors that might influence the underlying assumptions there?\nWill Lansing: I think a fair way to think about it is a bit of a continuation of what we're currently seeing. So flattish, modest, very modest kind of growth and the balance is made-up with price.\nSurinder Thind: Okay.\nWill Lansing: And the fact that we have a price lever makes a huge difference, it's part of why we have the confidence that we have.\nSurinder Thind: And at this point in time, I assume the special pricing term sheets all of that's been communicated?\nWill Lansing: Yes. Although, it hasn't taken effect. Yes.\nSurinder Thind: Okay. Correct. It will take effect I assume January 1. Correct?\nWill Lansing: For most, but not all customers. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. In your guidance for next year, can you outline what you're assuming for B2C growth in the Scores business?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. We don't want to get into too much detail around that. But consistent with Will's prior comment about more or less think about it as a continuation of the trends we're seeing. We've seen B2C down a little bit sequentially over the last couple of quarters and that's consistent with how we're thinking about the full year for '23.\nGeorge Tong: Great. And then with respect to margins, how much of the margin expansion that you're forecasting for next year is going to come from Scores versus software? Are you expecting more contribution from one part of the business over the other or is it relatively equal benefit from both?\nMike McLaughlin: Sorry. Could you say again, I think I missed the first part of it?\nGeorge Tong: Just trying to get a sense for how much of the margin expansion next year will be driven by software versus by Scores?\nMike McLaughlin: I see margin expansion. As we've talked about extensively in the past on the software - in the software business, our focus is on the platform and driving growth there. So we're not focused on dramatic margin improvement in the software business, we might have a little bit. But we're mostly focused on growth of the platform. In the Scores business, due to the gross margin nature of that business, relative to expense growth most of the dollar growth you see there, a lot of it falls to the bottom line. So in terms of contribution to operating margin expansion, it's weighted towards the Scores business for sure.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Meuler: Yes. Thank you. The multi-year extension with the large bureau partner, is that a B2C partnership or what was that? Was that something other than that?\nWill Lansing: No, that is the B2C partnership which as I think we shared in the past had a couple of more years to run. And what we've done is extended another few years beyond that. And so we now have a lot of certainty around when that B2C partnership looks like for many years to come.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then for the CPI pricing in Scores, how is that implemented? Like is it formulaic tied to CPI or do you kind of dictate an amount that is influenced by CPI? Just want to understand how that takes effect.\nWill Lansing: It's more the latter. Because as you know the CPI numbers are constantly moving and we could pick a number that's a point in time number that would be exactly the CPI. We could pick a rolling number, we could do a historical number, we could do a projection. And so we never get it exactly right. So we think our best guess and put down a number, but it's our interpretation.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then for the non-U.S. based clients in software how much of that is contracted in U.S. dollar? And to the extent to which it is, is there any market reaction in some of the markets where their currencies have been particularly weak relative to the dollar recently?\nWill Lansing: It's it is mostly U.S. dollars, and it's not a new thing for our customers to prefer to operate in their own currency and it's not a new thing for us to prefer to operate in U.S. dollars. So we kind of are where we are. And so yes, you can imagine that for them based on the strength of the dollar it's a little bit tougher. But we haven't changed our policies.\nMike McLaughlin: And that varies from geography to geography. So for example in Brazil, we're priced in Real for the most part. In the U.K., likewise pretty much priced in pounds, in the euro, it's mixed in sort of second and third world countries, it's dollar.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then just last we have the K and we get the client comp disclosure. Just any comment on the number of large financial institutions. So I guess in the U.S. went down from 96 to 92, are those software or Scores clients or is there an impact from - I don't remember the exact timing of the collection and recovery divestiture. And then it looks like a good news story internationally. I don't know how much this is rounding, but going from two-thirds to three quarters. Just any comment on those our client count metric?\nWill Lansing: I wouldn't read too much into that, Jeff. In the U.S. consolidation is something that we can't control that often reduces just the number of logos we have. And any change in the names - the number of logos would primarily be a function of software. We don't - everybody uses the FICO score essentially, among the large financial institutions, so that doesn't change. But there is not a trend that I would read into that. Internationally, there we do see new logos because there's a lot more greenfield internationally for us than in the U.S.\nOperator: I believe that's all the questions we have. I'll turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Thank you, everyone, for joining. And we look forward to speaking with you again soon or at the earliest next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thanks, Will. And good afternoon, everyone. As Will summarized we had another exceptional fiscal year and we are pleased with our momentum as we head into fiscal 2023. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $349 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.38 billion was up 5% over last year and up 8% when adjusted for the divestitures we completed in fiscal 2021. In our Scores segment, revenues for the quarter were $174 million, up 3% from the same period last year. B2B revenue was up 6% with growth in our auto scores and credit card and personal loans scores more than compensating for continued declines in mortgage score revenues. Our B2C revenue was down 3% from the same period last year, due primarily to the impact of fewer new subscribers on our myFICO.com platform, a trend we highlighted on last quarter's earnings call. For the full year, Scores revenues were $707 million up 8% from last year despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage origination space. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $175 million, up 5% versus the same period last year. Full year software revenues were $671 million, up 1% from the previous year and up 9% after adjusting for our 2021 divestitures. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which includes both North America and Latin America. Our EMEA region generated 11% and 7% was from Asia-Pacific. Our Software ARR at the end of the fourth quarter was $569 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $114 million, representing 20% of our total fourth quarter ARR, and a growth rate of 52% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the fourth quarter, which was 1% higher than the prior year. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 107% overall, our non-platform customer's software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 100%. Our platform customers are showing a very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for platform was 128% in the fourth quarter versus 143% in the prior year. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $30 million versus $26 million in the prior year. ACV bookings increased for the full year to $86 million versus $63 million in FY '21. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of new software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $215 million this quarter versus $219 million in the prior year. In fiscal 2022, our expenses benefited from a number of factors, including savings from divested businesses, headcount reduction actions taken at the end of FY '21, somewhat elevated employee attrition, and significant operational efficiencies achieved in our software segment. While we will continue our focus on expense efficiency in fiscal 2023, we expect our total expenses to trend up modestly in the coming year. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 47% for the quarter and 48% for the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 800 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $91 million up 6% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $112 million for the quarter and materially consistent with the same quarter last year. For the full year, GAAP net income was $374 million compared with $392 million last year. As a reminder, last year's GAAP net income included a gain of $100 million on product line asset sales and business divestitures. GAAP net income for fiscal 2022 was $454 million up 19% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the full year was 21% including $9 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%, that expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% in FY '23. Free cash flow for the quarter was $144 million. For the full year, free cash flow was $503 million up 21% from last year's $416 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $159 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.85 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 4.4%. As you recall, we issued $550 million in senior notes last December, locking in a fixed rate of 4%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is pre-payable at any time giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances if it is financially advantageous for us to do so in future periods. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 120,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $468 per share. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased a total of 2,678,000 shares at an average price of $409 per share for a total of $1.1 billion. The Board approved a new $500 million authorization in October and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I will turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY '23. Hi, Sam, it's Mike. As in past quarters, we don't disclose volumes precisely. But also as in past quarters, I can tell you that the volumes we saw are pretty consistent with what you have seen if you've been watching the third-party data out there from either the NBA or J.D. Power or credit card issuers themselves. Mortgage has declined for us in volume in a quantity consistent with what you can see from some of those data points. Auto was more or less flat both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, again consistent with external reporting. And on the credit card side, growth continued to be strong on a year-over-year basis. It was more or less flat on a quarter-over-quarter basis but consistent with the market. In terms of how we feel going forward, we don't make predictions about volumes in those sectors, we don't have economists that don't necessarily consider ourselves experts in forecasting that kind of consumer behavior. But I think you can have some confidence that our volumes will pretty much track the overall market as it has in past quarters. Well, we have a lot of quarter-to-quarter variability in the ACV bookings as you can see from our data. And our ACV bookings tend to be fourth quarter weighted. This year was a little less fourth quarter weighted than the last year. So I would encourage you to look at the year - at the full year comparison, not so much the quarter-over quarter because one quarter doesn't make a trend. Our year-over-year growth in ACV bookings as we talked about over 30%, and it reflects the underlying strength in a variety of areas of our business, our platform business, our customer communication business, as well. And the guidance that we have for next year is not heroic in terms of the amount of new ACV bookings we need to deliver relative to the past year. Okay. So you're talking about the Scores side of the business and sale of our Scores used for marketing or pre-screening purposes, is that correct? Okay. Got you. Yes, as with last quarter, we've seen a flattening of the growth in the sale of that type of Score, the pre-screening of pre-score sale. In fact. it was down a little bit this quarter on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And we do think it's somewhat of a leading indicator as to how much credit particularly credit card and personal loan, credit lenders want to extend in future periods. We've never analyzed precisely how predictive it is consistent with what we're seeing in the macro, the demand for that kind of a score was down a little bit on a quarter-over-quarter basis for us. Yes. I mean, just to add to that. We expect to grow revenues faster than expenses, it's kind of that simple. And we have reduced share count by such a degree that the EPS growth is going to be faster than net income growth. Yes. We don't want to get into too much detail around that. But consistent with Will's prior comment about more or less think about it as a continuation of the trends we're seeing. We've seen B2C down a little bit sequentially over the last couple of quarters and that's consistent with how we're thinking about the full year for '23. Sorry. Could you say again, I think I missed the first part of it? I see margin expansion. As we've talked about extensively in the past on the software - in the software business, our focus is on the platform and driving growth there. So we're not focused on dramatic margin improvement in the software business, we might have a little bit. But we're mostly focused on growth of the platform. In the Scores business, due to the gross margin nature of that business, relative to expense growth most of the dollar growth you see there, a lot of it falls to the bottom line. So in terms of contribution to operating margin expansion, it's weighted towards the Scores business for sure. And that varies from geography to geography. So for example in Brazil, we're priced in Real for the most part. In the U.K., likewise pretty much priced in pounds, in the euro, it's mixed in sort of second and third world countries, it's dollar."

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. And thank you everyone for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. I'm pleased to report that we had a very good quarter which completed an outstanding year with record revenues, record earnings, and record cash flows. We easily exceeded our guidance in all areas even after a mid-year raise. Pages 2 and 3 show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported revenues of $349 million in fourth quarter and $1.38 billion of revenue for the fiscal year. We delivered $91 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $3.55 per share. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $374 million of GAAP net income and $14.18 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $112 million and earnings per share were $4.40. Full year non-GAAP net income was $454 million, up 19% over last year, and non-GAAP EPS of $17.22 was up 32% over the previous year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q4 free cash flow was $144 million, bringing the fiscal year total to $503 million up 21% from the previous year. Our strong cash flow allowed us to be especially aggressive in returning capital to shareholders through our share buybacks. In fiscal 2022, we repurchased nearly 2.7 million shares at an average price of $409 per share. In our Software segment, we delivered $175 million of revenue, up 5% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9% and the platform ARR grew 52%. We continued to deliver strong NRR as well, demonstrating our land and expand strategy as customers increase their total usage. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8 was 107%. Platform NRR was 128% and we continue to see strong demand for our technology from new customers. Our ACV bookings as shown on Page 9, were up 14% over last year. We continue to focus on our state-of-the-art FICO platform, it truly is NextGen decisioning technology. It allows customers to use advanced analytics to optimize interactions with their consumers. In our Scores segment, we're seeing a continuation of the trend for the last several quarters. Mortgage originations have continued to decline and in Q4 accounted for just 11% of our Scores revenue and 5% of total company revenues. Auto originations revenues remained relatively stable with originations flat with last quarter and up 20% versus last year, primarily due to pricing. Card and personal loan originations continue to perform well with originations revenues up 37% over last year. Total Scores revenues were up 3% in the quarter versus the prior year and up 8% for the full year as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 6% in both the quarter and for the full year. This is a strong result considering the rapid and dramatic rise of interest rates and their impact on the mortgage market. On the B2C side, revenues were down 3% in the quarter due to a slowdown in new customer subscriptions on our myFICO platform and up 11% for the full year. I will discuss next year's guidance in greater detail later where we expect the Scores business to grow about 7%. We also expect the special pricing initiatives for 2023 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers consistent with those over the last several years. Although it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Finally, as you are aware, the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have completed their validation and approval of new credit score models. I'm pleased the process has concluded and that the FICO Scores has again been approved for using conforming mortgages by the enterprises. This decision means that FICO Score 10T will be required to be used when available, as classic FICO is today for each conforming mortgage delivered to the enterprises. The latest release of our flagship FICO score, FICO Score 10T delivers increased predictive power while preserving the trusted and proven FICO score minimum scoring criteria. These improvements in predictive power can help mortgage lenders safely avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates. The decision from the FHFA is the culmination of a multiyear process set out by both congressional and administrative regulation. We look forward to additional guidance from the FHFA and the enterprises on the timeline and the implementation process. I'm also pleased to report that in our fourth quarter we signed a multi-year extension with the large bureau partner in the consumer Scores space. I have some final comments and provide our fiscal '23 guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. Thanks, Mike. As we enter our fiscal 2023, I'm excited about our prospects and opportunities that lie ahead. We have an incredible set of assets and a business model that can produce predictable solid results even in a turbulent macro environment. Our FICO platform continues to experience phenomenal growth as we find a receptive audience for best-in-class decisioning that our panelists deliver. Our Scores business continues to deliver industry-standard risk management products that are especially critical in uncertain economic times. And the recent FHFA decision ensures that we'll be a critical component in the mortgage process for many years to come. The successful deal signings we had in fiscal '22, as well as prudent planning and management, give us confidence, we will have another successful year in fiscal '23. We are providing full year guidance as shown on the presentation. Regarding revenues of approximately $1.475 billion, an increase of 7% versus fiscal 22. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $401 million, an increase of 7.5%. GAAP earnings per share of approximately $16, an increase of 13%. Non-GAAP net income of $487 million and non-GAAP earnings per share of $19.42, increases of 7.5% and 13% respectively. With that, I'll turn it back over to Steve and we'll take questions. We are not seeing deals pushed out nor are we seeing deals downsized. It's probably worth noting that we have a fairly long sales cycle, it's approximately a year long. And so it's long enough in our view. But we have not seen softness. No, I think that the current solutions and offerings particularly around the platform are really strategic. And the - and our customers see them that way and it's a higher-level decision. And so whatever financial pressure our customers may be under, our deals with them seem not to be affected. Yes. What do you mean by slowdown in marketing? Yes, good question. So just starting with the special pricing. The special pricing is in addition to our guidance, it's not in that 7% exactly. It's really - think of it as being consistent with past years and outside of our guidance because we can't really predict the timing and so on. With respect to within the guidance, the 7%, we have a fairly significant CPI increase there which in years past has been there as well but it was always a much smaller number. This year we're talking about a reasonably significant number which is driving a fair bit of that. And also, I would say that mortgages it's a smaller piece of our business. And so we feel pretty good about the overall mix. It's a bit of both. I mean so, we're clearly holding the line on expenses, but it's also a smaller share count, they're both contributors. Yes. We anticipate repurchasing shares at a pace more or less consistent with our free cash flow generation for the year. Yes. We absolutely are. So we think of our target market as the top 200 financial institutions globally. And our penetration there is around 15%, little over 30 customers signed through the platform. And so our conversation takes two forms. One is, let's talk to the other 85% of our target market that has not yet signed up for the platform, as well as expansion opportunities with the ones who already have. And both of those kind of conversations are going on, and very successfully. So consumer B2C does have - does move in sympathy with mortgage volumes because as you know consumers tend to sign-up for that kind of subscription, with contemplating mortgages when they are wondering what their FICO score is going to be for them when they go out and get financing. So as mortgage volumes go down so to - with a little bit of a lag with so to do our B2C myFICO volumes. Our volumes are - they're good, they're down a little bit, they're good. And same with our partners, our partners are - they're doing okay. I think a fair way to think about it is a bit of a continuation of what we're currently seeing. So flattish, modest, very modest kind of growth and the balance is made-up with price. And the fact that we have a price lever makes a huge difference, it's part of why we have the confidence that we have. Yes. Although, it hasn't taken effect. Yes. For most, but not all customers. Yes. No, that is the B2C partnership which as I think we shared in the past had a couple of more years to run. And what we've done is extended another few years beyond that. And so we now have a lot of certainty around when that B2C partnership looks like for many years to come. It's more the latter. Because as you know the CPI numbers are constantly moving and we could pick a number that's a point in time number that would be exactly the CPI. We could pick a rolling number, we could do a historical number, we could do a projection. And so we never get it exactly right. So we think our best guess and put down a number, but it's our interpretation. It's it is mostly U.S. dollars, and it's not a new thing for our customers to prefer to operate in their own currency and it's not a new thing for us to prefer to operate in U.S. dollars. So we kind of are where we are. And so yes, you can imagine that for them based on the strength of the dollar it's a little bit tougher. But we haven't changed our policies. I wouldn't read too much into that, Jeff. In the U.S. consolidation is something that we can't control that often reduces just the number of logos we have. And any change in the names - the number of logos would primarily be a function of software. We don't - everybody uses the FICO score essentially, among the large financial institutions, so that doesn't change. But there is not a trend that I would read into that. Internationally, there we do see new logos because there's a lot more greenfield internationally for us than in the U.S."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, August 3, 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO\u2019s third quarter earnings call. I\u2019m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel, that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company\u2019s website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 3, 2023. And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I\u2019ll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I\u2019ll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we\u2019re seeing in the markets we serve. We again delivered very strong results in a noncertain marketplace, which demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the value proposition we deliver. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $349 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last year or 7% when adjusted for last year\u2019s sale of our collections and recovery products. We delivered $93 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.61 per share, up 21% and 36%, respectively, when adjusted for last year\u2019s gain on sale. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $116 million, up 17%, and earnings per share of $4.47 was up 32% from last year. Our Scores business continues to perform well despite headwinds in the mortgage market. Scores were up 4% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 3%. Mortgage continues to be the headwind as originations have declined as interest rates rise. Mortgage originations revenues were down 25% versus last year. Mortgage origination revenues now account for about 12% of our Scores revenues and 6% of our total company revenues. Excluding mortgage, total B2B revenues were up about 12% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 12%, and credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%. We also had double-digit year-over-year increases in our prescreen scores. On the B2C side, revenues were up 7% from the previous year. The slowdown in growth came primarily in our direct myFICO.com channel, where we are seeing fewer new customers coming online. Our partner channel, which includes paid and freemium components, continues to drive double-digit growth. In our Software segment, we delivered $170 million of revenue, up 2% from last year and 11% after adjusting for the divestiture. As you know, over several quarters, we\u2019ve talked about the demand for our platform and how we see substantial growth opportunities. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9%, and the Platform ARR again grew at a remarkable 60%. Our net retention rate is also very strong as our existing customers continued to expand their usage. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 108%. Platform NRR was 135%. We also had a very good quarter with new sales. Our ACV bookings, as shown on Page 9, was up 64% over last year. We\u2019re extremely excited about the continued growth potential for our FICO platform, and that excitement was shared by our customers at our recent FICO World Conference. The 3-day event hosted in May was an opportunity to finally connect face-to-face with our clients, partners, industry experts and colleagues to reinforce FICO\u2019s vision and commitment to client success. We hosted 750 FICO clients from leading banks, financial services firms, auto finance companies, insurance providers and telcos. The event in Orlando included 90 breakout sessions as well as hundreds of individual strategic consulting engagements, all designed to help our customers identify how FICO can enable them to accelerate and achieve their goals with the FICO platform. It was also a great opportunity here from FICO customers, with nearly 70 clients presenting during breakout sessions, sharing the success stories and lessons learned. FICO World \u201822 was an essential moment where we had the opportunity to explain and demonstrate our platform strategy directly to our most strategic clients. Clients rated this FICO World the best FICO World of all past events, and we\u2019ve already seen a surge in registrations for the next FICO World, to be held May 13 through 16 in Hollywood, Florida. I\u2019ll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back over to Mike for financial details.\nMike McLaughlin: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong results and remain confident that we can deliver on the increased guidance we issued last quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter was $349 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line last June. In our Scores segment, revenues were $179 million, up 4% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 3% over the prior year. As Will mentioned, we continue to see a decline in mortgage origination revenues, which were down 25% from the same quarter last year. However, other parts of the portfolio continue to be strong. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%, and originations revenues and auto originations revenues were up 12%. And we continue to see nice growth in our prescreen scores, which is a good sign for continued strength in credit card originations. B2C Scores revenues were up 7% from the same period last year driven by strong growth from our partner channel. FICO\u2019s Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $170 million, up 2% versus the same period last year or 11% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business. Software license revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time was $21 million -- was $20 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, these point-in-time revenues are a result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to recognize upfront a portion of the total contract value of multiyear on-premise software license subscription sales and renewals. Point-in-time revenues will vary from quarter-to-quarter driven primarily by the mix of on-premise versus SaaS subscription sales. It\u2019s important to note that our ARR metric is not impacted by these point-in-time revenue accounting rules. As expected, we continue to see lower Software professional services revenues. Those revenues were $27 million this quarter, up slightly from last quarter, but down 24% from the same period last year, much of it due to last year\u2019s divestiture. This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our Asia Pacific region generated 5%. And the remaining 11% was from EMEA. Our Software ARR at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2022 was $561 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Platform business continues to perform extremely well. Platform ARR was $108 million, representing 19% of our total third quarter ARR, with a growth rate of 60% versus the prior year. Our non-Platform ARR was $453 million in the quarter, up 1% from the prior year. As a reminder, our reported ARR and related metrics exclude all revenues from divestitures in prior periods. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 108% overall. Again, we\u2019re seeing exceptional performance in our Platform business as customers continue to expand their usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for Platform was 135% in the third quarter. Our non-Platform customers software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable, with a net retention rate of 101% this quarter. Software sales were again strong this quarter, with annual contract value bookings of $19 million versus $11.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 64%. Our ACV bookings include only the annual recurring value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $208 million this quarter, up slightly from our second quarter. We expect expenses to continue to increase modestly in our fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 1,000 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $93 million, and our GAAP EPS was $3.61, which was down from last year when we had a $93 million pretax gain on sale of our collections and recovery product line. Our non-GAAP net income was $116 million for the quarter, up 17% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million, up 16% from the same period last year. For the trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was $449 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $182 million in cash and investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86%. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 735,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $384 per share. At the end of June, we had about $119 million remaining on the current Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY \u201822.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I\u2019m pleased with our ability to continue to deliver strong results and how we can meet our customer needs while working in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to deliver mission-critical software and analytics to customers. As the financial services industry continues to navigate the impacts of economic volatility, the need for precision through advanced analytics has never been more important. Lenders are seeking more ways to assess risk and opportunity in real-time to inform decision-making. And we have the technology and expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions. Our Scores business continues to provide lenders with time-tested analytics that help manage risk throughout the consumer lending market. And the use of those scores throughout the many different lending markets means we\u2019re not highly leveraged to specific types of lending more customers. On the Software side, we continue to drive remarkable Platform ARR and NRR growth, demonstrating a strong market appreciation and appetite for our latest decisioning technology. Finally, as you know, it\u2019s our practice to provide only annual guidance, so it\u2019s not our policy to raise guidance in our fourth quarter. I\u2019m pleased to say we are reiterating the full year guidance that we raised last quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to meet or beat the numbers we have presented and look forward to discussing our fiscal \u201823 expectations when we release our results next quarter. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we\u2019re now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Well, I just wanted to touch on the last point you made where you said you\u2019re kind of prepared to meet or beat the guidance. But I was hoping you could just walk us through some of the moving pieces. It sounds like maybe mortgage could work, myFICO-dot could work. And anything else that perhaps either got worse or better, and maybe throw in some comments on pricing in there as well?\nWill Lansing: Well, those -- I mean, pricing is really a discussion for next year. I mean the pricing is baked in for this year. And those really are the puts and takes. I mean we\u2019ve got mortgage headwind, and everything else is pretty strong.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson: I just wanted to have a question on Software. Results are really strong, especially on the ARR side this quarter for Platform. Have you guys seen any change, whether it\u2019s in longer sales cycles or clients looking at potentially down-gauging deals with some recessionary fears kind of perking up here?\nWill Lansing: No, no. We really have not. I would say that the IT spending in the financial services industry seems to be on track and hasn\u2019t moved a whole lot. Sales cycles have not gotten any longer. They\u2019re the same, which is not to say they\u2019re short, but they\u2019re what they have always been. And so I would say no change.\nKyle Peterson: Understood. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, I guess, just following up on the expense run rate. You showed some really good margin leverage this quarter despite having your conference. Then you guys said expenses up modestly next quarter. What are the biggest drivers of higher expenses here? Is it just higher personnel and wage costs, just given the tight labor market? Or are there any other investments that you guys are making, that you guys want to call out right now?\nWill Lansing: It\u2019s a couple of things. We\u2019re going back to a little bit more of the pre-COVID travel expense that has started -- is just starting to kick in again. And I would say that we are hiring. Attrition is more or less where it\u2019s always been, but I think it\u2019s taking us a little longer to backfill than in years past. It\u2019s a tight market out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: A question about the ACV bookings here. It\u2019s the third consecutive quarter of a really strong number. Any color or commentary there, in addition to what you\u2019ve kind of said on the call, in the sense that I think the expectation is, is that relative to where expectations were, you guys are well ahead of that. And there also tends to be seasonality next quarter. So how should we think about that? Has there been any pull forward? Or should we just expect the normal seasonality as well?\nMike McLaughlin: So ACV bookings, as you know, is a new metric reported externally. We\u2019ve been tracking it internally longer than that, of course. And we set high goals for ourselves for this year in terms of new sales, and we\u2019re on track to hit those. There isn\u2019t a material amount of pull-forward or any that I can put my finger on that\u2019s happened this quarter or quarters before. ACV bookings is a pretty good metric because it doesn\u2019t have the revenue acceleration dynamics or distortions that you see with other metrics. And we do expect Q4 to be good in terms of ACV bookings as it usually is.\nSurinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of the professional services, they had been declining for a while. I think, last quarter, you talked about them kind of bottoming. And then there was a meaningful uptick this quarter. I mean I realize it\u2019s not a large number, but it\u2019s -- that was a bigger uptick than I was anticipating. Any color there? Or what kind of drives the run rate there? Where should that kind of balance out?\nMike McLaughlin: Yes. I think it was my prediction, as you correctly point out, last quarter that we may have reached the bottom. I think that\u2019s demonstrated early, so we have 1 quarter\u2019s data point that, that is the case. When we shifted our strategic focus away from lower-margin professional services to focus more of our go-to-market energies on annual recurring software, we saw significant decline in the bookings of new professional services once we made that decision. It takes a while for those bookings to work their way through revenues because we, in any given quarter, have 3 or 4 quarters of backlog of professional services that we continue to work our way through. So we -- you can\u2019t see it from the outside, but we saw our professional services new bookings go down pretty rapidly when we made the policy change. That decline in bookings stabilized about 4 -- 3 to 4 quarters ago, so the bookings are no longer declining. And it took a few quarters for the PS revenues to catch up and hit this, as you say, the new normal. So this kind of $25 million a quarter is probably a pretty good expectation in the near term.\nSurinder Thind: Helpful. And then a question or a color on the B2C part of the business. You talked about continued double-digit growth at your partner, potentially seeing a slowdown in growth at myFICO.com. Any color there in terms of is it simply the net new additions number? Are you seeing a bit more, perhaps, turnover at myFICO.com? Any color you can provide there?\nWill Lansing: No, it\u2019s really the net new additions. I mean it has to do with the fact that we see spike in that business when people are out mortgage shopping. And so as mortgage volumes fall off, consumers subscribe to that in smaller numbers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: You provided revenue performance across mortgage, autos and card and personal loans. Can you describe how price and volume trends contributed to performance in those categories?\nMike McLaughlin: Price played a part. I think that if you look at the externally available numbers for performance in those 3 categories, that our volume realizations were similar to what you would think they would be if you looked at things like J.D. Power or the NBA or the results of the bureaus that reported in the last week or 1.5 weeks. I would say, as we said last quarter, that the mortgage decline in terms of units has been pretty consistent with what we expected it would be for the year when we set guidance and then revised it. Last quarter, autos have been a little worse than we expected, but our revised guidance bakes in that change. And then credit card and others is -- those volumes are doing really nicely as we expected. So we\u2019re tracking the market pretty closely as best we can tell in terms of volumes.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And then with respect to your Software business, the percentage of ARR that\u2019s moving on Platform continues to tick higher. Can you lay out what internal goals you have for where you would like to see the mix of ARR on-Platform versus off-Platform over the next -- over the near to medium term?\nWill Lansing: We don\u2019t have a forced mix. We aggressively go after as much new Platform business and expansion Platform business as we can get. So that is a strategic priority for us. At the same time, we have so many customers who are involved with our legacy solutions and rely on us for that and renew those deals, that we continue to invest in features and functionality there. And I think, from our perspective, as long as that\u2019s neutral to growing very modestly, we\u2019re thrilled. And even if we were shrinking a little bit, it probably wouldn\u2019t bother us very much. But we\u2019re pretty happy with the mix the way it is, with dramatic growth on the Platform side and kind of flat growth on the legacy side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: On B2B Scores, what\u2019s the typical lag from when the bureau gets the inquiry, to when it\u2019s recognized by FICO as revenue? And the reason I asked is like it looks like you\u2019re seeing some acceleration in card growth relative to last quarter. Your delta versus industry credit inquiries within mortgage was a little bit wider this quarter than it was last quarter. So I\u2019m just trying to understand to what extent that\u2019s a timing difference or if there\u2019s some other factor that\u2019s accounting for that.\nMike McLaughlin: Yes, Jeff, there really isn\u2019t a timing difference with one caveat. The last month of the quarter, the data that we get from the bureaus, by the time we need to finalize it for closing the books, is tentative and subject to revision, I guess, I would say. And so we have to make some estimates and accruals based on judgment and lots of past experience as to what that will be. So occasionally, there will be a little bit of a true-up when we get the final data in there, but it\u2019s not material and it\u2019s not an explanation to the dynamic that you see in the data you just cited there. It\u2019s real-time for June and with, as I say, with that asterisk.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. And then on myFICO, just so I understand it correctly, it\u2019s still growing year-over-year, is that correct?\nMike McLaughlin: It\u2019s more or less flat on a quarter-to-quarter basis, which means it\u2019s still growing on a year-over-year basis. But if you look at the last couple of quarters, as Will mentioned, we\u2019re seeing a lot less net new, probably because less people are shopping for mortgages. And that leads us to be cautious about the next couple of quarters at myFICO.\nJeff Meuler: Understood. Yes, the whole industry is seeing a much softer direct channel. I think if you\u2019re up year-over-year and flat sequentially, you\u2019re pretty significantly outperforming the industry\u2019s direct channel. And then just on FICO World. Great to hear the registrations and that you\u2019re doing it again in May of next year. How is the pipeline build? I would imagine that was a pretty significant pipeline building event for you itself, a little bit like a coming-out party for Platform. And you haven\u2019t had it for a few years. So I would think that it\u2019s actually a pretty big needle-mover relative to the last couple of years. If you could just talk about pipe build coming out of FICO World.\nWill Lansing: Yes, that\u2019s exactly right. So FICO World is several days of our showcasing our wares. But really, the heavy relationship building occurs in these consultation sessions where we sit down with clients individually and really were true, what we can do for them. And the pipeline that comes out of FICO World is phenomenal.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nJohn Mazzoni: This is John filling in for Ashish. Can you just talk about the slowing total Software ARR growth in the quarter?\nMike McLaughlin: Well, it\u2019s slowed by a relatively small amount, and I would attribute that to normal quarter-to-quarter variability. And if you look at the 8-plus quarters that we revealed for that metric when we introduced it in November, you can see that, that kind of quarter-to-quarter variation is commonplace. So it\u2019s not a reflection of anything fundamental, I wouldn\u2019t say.\nOperator: And all that does conclude the Q&A session for today. Mr. Weber, I\u2019ll turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.\nSteve Weber: Thank you, and thank you to everyone for joining. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you.\nOperator: And all that will conclude the call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong results and remain confident that we can deliver on the increased guidance we issued last quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter was $349 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 7% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line last June. In our Scores segment, revenues were $179 million, up 4% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 3% over the prior year. As Will mentioned, we continue to see a decline in mortgage origination revenues, which were down 25% from the same quarter last year. However, other parts of the portfolio continue to be strong. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%, and originations revenues and auto originations revenues were up 12%. And we continue to see nice growth in our prescreen scores, which is a good sign for continued strength in credit card originations. B2C Scores revenues were up 7% from the same period last year driven by strong growth from our partner channel. FICO's Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $170 million, up 2% versus the same period last year or 11% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business. Software license revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time was $21 million -- was $20 million in the quarter compared to $13 million in the same period last year. As a reminder, these point-in-time revenues are a result of GAAP accounting rules that require us to recognize upfront a portion of the total contract value of multiyear on-premise software license subscription sales and renewals. Point-in-time revenues will vary from quarter-to-quarter driven primarily by the mix of on-premise versus SaaS subscription sales. It's important to note that our ARR metric is not impacted by these point-in-time revenue accounting rules. As expected, we continue to see lower Software professional services revenues. Those revenues were $27 million this quarter, up slightly from last quarter, but down 24% from the same period last year, much of it due to last year's divestiture. This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our Asia Pacific region generated 5%. And the remaining 11% was from EMEA. Our Software ARR at the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2022 was $561 million, a 9% increase over the prior year quarter. Our Platform business continues to perform extremely well. Platform ARR was $108 million, representing 19% of our total third quarter ARR, with a growth rate of 60% versus the prior year. Our non-Platform ARR was $453 million in the quarter, up 1% from the prior year. As a reminder, our reported ARR and related metrics exclude all revenues from divestitures in prior periods. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 108% overall. Again, we're seeing exceptional performance in our Platform business as customers continue to expand their usage. The dollar-based net retention rate for Platform was 135% in the third quarter. Our non-Platform customers software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable, with a net retention rate of 101% this quarter. Software sales were again strong this quarter, with annual contract value bookings of $19 million versus $11.6 million in the prior year, an increase of 64%. Our ACV bookings include only the annual recurring value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $208 million this quarter, up slightly from our second quarter. We expect expenses to continue to increase modestly in our fourth quarter. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 1,000 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $93 million, and our GAAP EPS was $3.61, which was down from last year when we had a $93 million pretax gain on sale of our collections and recovery product line. Our non-GAAP net income was $116 million for the quarter, up 17% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $115 million, up 16% from the same period last year. For the trailing 12-month period, free cash flow was $449 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $182 million in cash and investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.86%. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 735,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $384 per share. At the end of June, we had about $119 million remaining on the current Board authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY \u201822. So ACV bookings, as you know, is a new metric reported externally. We've been tracking it internally longer than that, of course. And we set high goals for ourselves for this year in terms of new sales, and we're on track to hit those. There isn't a material amount of pull-forward or any that I can put my finger on that's happened this quarter or quarters before. ACV bookings is a pretty good metric because it doesn't have the revenue acceleration dynamics or distortions that you see with other metrics. And we do expect Q4 to be good in terms of ACV bookings as it usually is. Yes. I think it was my prediction, as you correctly point out, last quarter that we may have reached the bottom. I think that's demonstrated early, so we have 1 quarter's data point that, that is the case. When we shifted our strategic focus away from lower-margin professional services to focus more of our go-to-market energies on annual recurring software, we saw significant decline in the bookings of new professional services once we made that decision. It takes a while for those bookings to work their way through revenues because we, in any given quarter, have 3 or 4 quarters of backlog of professional services that we continue to work our way through. So we -- you can't see it from the outside, but we saw our professional services new bookings go down pretty rapidly when we made the policy change. That decline in bookings stabilized about 4 -- 3 to 4 quarters ago, so the bookings are no longer declining. And it took a few quarters for the PS revenues to catch up and hit this, as you say, the new normal. So this kind of $25 million a quarter is probably a pretty good expectation in the near term. Price played a part. I think that if you look at the externally available numbers for performance in those 3 categories, that our volume realizations were similar to what you would think they would be if you looked at things like J.D. Power or the NBA or the results of the bureaus that reported in the last week or 1.5 weeks. I would say, as we said last quarter, that the mortgage decline in terms of units has been pretty consistent with what we expected it would be for the year when we set guidance and then revised it.

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We posted some slides with our results on the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll be referencing some of those slides during our presentation today. I'll go over the results of our third fiscal quarter and discuss what we're seeing in the markets we serve. We again delivered very strong results in a noncertain marketplace, which demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the value proposition we deliver. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $349 million, an increase of 3% over the same period last year or 7% when adjusted for last year's sale of our collections and recovery products. We delivered $93 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.61 per share, up 21% and 36%, respectively, when adjusted for last year's gain on sale. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $116 million, up 17%, and earnings per share of $4.47 was up 32% from last year. Our Scores business continues to perform well despite headwinds in the mortgage market. Scores were up 4% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. On the B2B side, revenues were up 3%. Mortgage continues to be the headwind as originations have declined as interest rates rise. Mortgage originations revenues were down 25% versus last year. Mortgage origination revenues now account for about 12% of our Scores revenues and 6% of our total company revenues. Excluding mortgage, total B2B revenues were up about 12% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 12%, and credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 37%. We also had double-digit year-over-year increases in our prescreen scores. On the B2C side, revenues were up 7% from the previous year. The slowdown in growth came primarily in our direct myFICO.com channel, where we are seeing fewer new customers coming online. Our partner channel, which includes paid and freemium components, continues to drive double-digit growth. In our Software segment, we delivered $170 million of revenue, up 2% from last year and 11% after adjusting for the divestiture. As you know, over several quarters, we've talked about the demand for our platform and how we see substantial growth opportunities. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 9%, and the Platform ARR again grew at a remarkable 60%. Our net retention rate is also very strong as our existing customers continued to expand their usage. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 108%. Platform NRR was 135%. We also had a very good quarter with new sales. Our ACV bookings, as shown on Page 9, was up 64% over last year. We're extremely excited about the continued growth potential for our FICO platform, and that excitement was shared by our customers at our recent FICO World Conference. The 3-day event hosted in May was an opportunity to finally connect face-to-face with our clients, partners, industry experts and colleagues to reinforce FICO's vision and commitment to client success. We hosted 750 FICO clients from leading banks, financial services firms, auto finance companies, insurance providers and telcos. The event in Orlando included 90 breakout sessions as well as hundreds of individual strategic consulting engagements, all designed to help our customers identify how FICO can enable them to accelerate and achieve their goals with the FICO platform. It was also a great opportunity here from FICO customers, with nearly 70 clients presenting during breakout sessions, sharing the success stories and lessons learned. FICO World \u201822 was an essential moment where we had the opportunity to explain and demonstrate our platform strategy directly to our most strategic clients. Clients rated this FICO World the best FICO World of all past events, and we've already seen a surge in registrations for the next FICO World, to be held May 13 through 16 in Hollywood, Florida. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back over to Mike for financial details. Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm pleased with our ability to continue to deliver strong results and how we can meet our customer needs while working in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to deliver mission-critical software and analytics to customers. As the financial services industry continues to navigate the impacts of economic volatility, the need for precision through advanced analytics has never been more important. Lenders are seeking more ways to assess risk and opportunity in real-time to inform decision-making. And we have the technology and expertise to deliver best-in-class solutions. Our Scores business continues to provide lenders with time-tested analytics that help manage risk throughout the consumer lending market. And the use of those scores throughout the many different lending markets means we're not highly leveraged to specific types of lending more customers. On the Software side, we continue to drive remarkable Platform ARR and NRR growth, demonstrating a strong market appreciation and appetite for our latest decisioning technology. Finally, as you know, it's our practice to provide only annual guidance, so it's not our policy to raise guidance in our fourth quarter. I'm pleased to say we are reiterating the full year guidance that we raised last quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to meet or beat the numbers we have presented and look forward to discussing our fiscal \u201823 expectations when we release our results next quarter. I'll turn the call back to Steve for Q&A. Well, those -- I mean, pricing is really a discussion for next year. I mean the pricing is baked in for this year. And those really are the puts and takes. I mean we've got mortgage headwind, and everything else is pretty strong. No, no. We really have not. I would say that the IT spending in the financial services industry seems to be on track and hasn't moved a whole lot. Sales cycles have not gotten any longer. They're the same, which is not to say they're short, but they're what they have always been. And so I would say no change. It's a couple of things. We're going back to a little bit more of the pre-COVID travel expense that has started -- is just starting to kick in again. And I would say that we are hiring. Attrition is more or less where it's always been, but I think it's taking us a little longer to backfill than in years past. It's a tight market out there. No, it's really the net new additions. I mean it has to do with the fact that we see spike in that business when people are out mortgage shopping. And so as mortgage volumes fall off, consumers subscribe to that in smaller numbers. We don't have a forced mix. We aggressively go after as much new Platform business and expansion Platform business as we can get. So that is a strategic priority for us.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterward, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded, Wednesday, April 27, 2022. 00:29 And now, I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteven Weber: 00:34 Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining FICO's second-quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Will Lansing, our CEO and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes our financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. 00:59 Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company's business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. 01:34 This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2023. 02:05 And now, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: 02:08 Thanks, Steve and thanks to all of you who are joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results as we pursue our strategic initiatives in both Scores and Software. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we view our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. 02:36 As you can see on page two of the presentation, we reported revenues of $357 million, which is an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $104 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, up 52% and 70%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $124 million, up 37% and earnings per share of $4.68 were up 53% from last year. 03:08 On the Scores side, the business continues to perform well. Scores were up 9% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page six. On the B2B side, revenues were up 5%. As others have reported, we continue to see a slowdown in mortgage activity as interest rates rise. Mortgage origination revenues were down 23% versus last year. Mortgage revenues account for about 14% of our Scores revenues and 7% of our total company revenues. 03:43 Auto origination revenues were up 9%. Personal loan origination revenues were up 27%. While the mortgage declines have been significant, we do remain confident in our revenues given other areas of strength and pricing increases. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 18% versus the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO business and also through our channel partners. 04:13 In our Software segment, we delivered $173 million of revenue, up 7% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As you can see on page seven, total ARR was up 11% and the platform ARR grew 60%. We continue to deliver strong NRR as well demonstrating our existing customers eagerness to find new ways to expand their usage. 04:40 Total NRR for the quarter, which you can see on page eight, was 110%. Platform NRR was 141%, and we continue to sign more deals and bigger deals. Our ACV bookings, as seen on page nine, were up 55% over last year. I'll have some final comments including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details.\nMichael McLaughlin: 05:08 Thanks, Will, and good afternoon everyone. As Will said, we continue to drive strong growth throughout the business. Total revenue for the second quarter was $357 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year or 13% after adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery product line last June. 05:25 In our Scores segment, revenues were a record $184 million, up 9% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenue was up 5% over the prior year. As expected, mortgage origination revenues continued to decline, down 23% from the same quarter last year, but that was more than offset by growth in other areas. 05:46 Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 27% and auto originations revenues were up 9%. B2B non-originations revenues, which include FICO scores used for pre-screening, account management and insurance, were up 16%. B2C Scores revenues were up 18% from the same period last year. Both myFICO.com and partner B2C revenues grew significantly. 06:12 Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $173 million, up 7% versus the same period last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business, software revenues were up about 19%. Software license revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time as it is referred to on our 10-Q, was $27 million this quarter, compared to $12 million in the same period last year. 06:38 Our lower margin professional services revenues, which we are strategically deemphasizing were $24 million and down from $37 million in the same period last year. This quarter 78% of our total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our Asia-Pacific region generated 12% and the remaining 10% was from EMEA. 06:59 Our software ARR at the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2022 was $550 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $97 million, representing 18% of our total second quarter ARR and a growth rate of 60% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $453 million in the first quarter -- sorry, in the second quarter, up 4% from the prior year. A quick reminder, our reported ARR and related metrics exclude all revenue from divestitures in prior period. 07:35 Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 110% overall. We continue to drive very strong expansion from our platform customers as they expand their usage. The dollar based net retention rate for platform software was 141% in the second quarter. Our non-platform software usage continues to be mature and relatively stable, which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 103% this quarter. Software sales were strong again this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $20.6 million versus $13.3 million in the prior year, an increase of 55%. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annually recurring value of software sales, excluding professional services. 08:20 Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $205 million this quarter, a decrease from $230 million in the same quarter last year. This year-over-year decrease is primarily due to the divestiture of our Collections and Recovery business, as well as various cost reduction initiatives. 08:38 Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule was 51% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 1,200 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $104 million, up 52% from the prior year quarter. Our GAAP EPS was $3.95, up 75% or 70% from the prior year. 09:02 Our non-GAAP net income was $124 million for the quarter, up 37% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21%. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26% before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. 09:28 Free cash flow for the quarter was $120 million versus $152 million in the same period last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $207 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.81 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.70%. 09:47 Turning to return of capital, we bought back 580,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $455 per share. During the quarter, the prior Board repurchase authorization was exhausted and as previously communicated, a new $500 million authorization was approved. At the end of March, we had about $400 million remaining on that authorization and continue to do share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. 10:13 With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY 2022.\nWilliam Lansing: 10:17 Thank you, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means that we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is important in a rising rate environment. 10:41 On the software side, we continue to see more evidence that we're on the right strategic path. We've now delivered 10 straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. And we're excited to demonstrate to new and existing customers the best-in-class capabilities that can revolutionize the way they interact with consumers. As always, we remain focused on execution and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we're making. 11:08 Finally, today, we're raising our full-year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.355 billion. As we've noted, we're facing difficult comps in mortgage, but we're seeing strong growth in the unsecured lending markets and in most of our software markets. Some of these trends were anticipated, but there is clearly uncertainty as we move through the next half year.  11:35 We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income as well as EPS. Our GAAP net income is now expected to be $350 million. GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $13.11. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $429 million and non-GAAP EPS are now $16.08. 12:02 I'll now turn the call back to Steve and we will take the questions. Steve?\nSteven Weber: 12:07 Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks and we will now take your questions. Operator, please open up the line.\nOperator: 12:14 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKyle Peterson: 12:40 Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to touch on your margins, really impressive this quarter. The expenses kind of come in leaner than expected. I know a lot of companies have been talking about inflation dynamics and cost pressures. How are you guys managing the cost? And is there anything kind of one time in terms of like timing of spending that we need to keep in mind as we progress through the year?\nWilliam Lansing: 13:11 Well, our expenses will be a bit higher in the second half than they were in the first half, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing expenses. Some things like travel and real estate are the kinds of things we expect coming out of COVID. They're still under control and less than they were in the old days. So there is that kind of cost control. 13:33 But I would say that we're also doing a pretty good job on the software side of bringing down our COGS and we're starting to see some benefits from our increasing focus on engineering our products and solutions for cost and efficiency and scaling. And so, all that's coming together and improving our margins.\nKyle Peterson: 14:00 That's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the guidance raise on the topline, I know there's quite a few moving pieces, but just wanted to see if you guys could give any color on the dynamics between the pricing benefit and I\u2019m also assuming it's some lower volume assumptions, at least on the mortgage side of things. So, just wondered if you could give some of the puts and takes of kind of the pricing versus volume and the net impact of those in your updated assumptions.\nWilliam Lansing: 14:38 It varies by the segment of Scores you're talking about, but there is definitely price benefit in there. Some volumes are down, some volumes are up, but prices offsetting the declines.\nKyle Peterson: 14:56 All right. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter.\nWilliam Lansing: 14:59 Thank you.\nOperator: 15:00 Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: 15:06 Thank you. Good evening. Will, I just wanted to -- I was hoping you could expand on the comments you made on -- you have diversified lending categories. I know you said mortgage was 14% this quarter, I guess. Could you just help us with what auto, personal loans, et cetera is and perhaps what you're assuming in your guidance for those?\nMichael McLaughlin: 15:31 Hey, Manav, it's Mike. Consistent with what we've shared in the past, the three segments of the originations, part of our B2B business, are roughly the same size. That varies from quarter to quarter, one grows or shrinks, but in approximate terms, that's the way to think about and we don't get into specifics beyond that.\nManav Patnaik: 15:56 Okay. And when you say same size, you mean 14%, which was mortgage would be the same as -- would be the same for cars and auto?\nMichael McLaughlin: 16:07 In terms of dollars for B2B originations, that's correct.\nManav Patnaik: 16:12 Yeah. Okay, got it. And then perhaps -- obviously, there's a lot of uncertainties in the market et cetera. I was just hoping you could help us understand how your pricing strategy changes? Should we do -- enter a period of a slowdown?\nWilliam Lansing: 16:32 Well, we take it every year year-by-year and we're committed to consistently increasing our revenue and net income and EPS. We do what we have to do on price to make sure that that remains true. I think, you can expect that from us. It would take fairly calamitous change in the cycle for that to not be true. 16:57 But that's really what goes into figuring out how aggressively we move on price and you've also heard us talk about the pacing and the moderation in the way we go at pricing. We don't want to shock the system. And so it's that balancing act. I think that we put a very high value on consistency of growth. And so, I think you should expect that even as the cycle spins down a little bit, and we do what we have to do on pricing to make that happen.\nManav Patnaik: 17:36 Fair enough, thank you.\nOperator: 17:41 Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: 17:46 Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. So just wanted to dive further into the special pricing increases, can you share what the customer receptivity has been so far this year, two price increases, and then as you look across the verticals, which vertical has seen more price increases than others? In the last year when mortgage volumes were very strong, price increases were not as high in the mortgage vertical. So are we seeing a reversal there? Just any additional commentary would be great there.\nWilliam Lansing: 18:21 George, you know, I talked about this in the past and you know, nobody loves price increases, okay. So, when you say what's the receptivity. I think customers will prefer not to have price increases than they have them, but I think that they expect reasonable and appropriate price increases from us and that's what we deliver and they've been well received. 18:41 We haven't had any significant deflection. We have no major customers leaving us. We have no threat to major customers leaving us. And so, I would say that we've been able to strike a pretty good balance between the price increases that led us consistently drive revenue and earnings without -- again without shocking the system. So, in short, I think, it's a conservative strategy and it's working well on the ecosystem.\nGeorge Tong: 19:12 And then the part on where you're seeing more or less price increases by vertical mortgage versus card versus autos?\nWilliam Lansing: 19:20 Well, so as I said in the past, we are increasingly trying to spread the price increases in ways that they are less visible to the customers and less visible to you. Our goal in a perfect world would be -- we could even point our fingers at where the price increase happened. 19:40 So there is a fairly elaborate exercise that we do internally to figure out where are the pockets of inelasticity where we can do price increases without losing volume. And so, we do that and we're getting better and better and better at that and that lets us do it in a way that's not nearly as visible and not as easy to describe. So I can't really give you a lot more detail there.\nGeorge Tong: 20:09 Got it. That's helpful. And then [Multiple Speakers]\nWilliam Lansing: 20:16 No, what's your next question, George?\nGeorge Tong: 20:19 I just wanted to get sort of your experience in working with the FHFA so far, whether you are in regular conversations with them? And where in the process you believe they are in terms of ultimately reaching a decision on mortgage source?\nWilliam Lansing: 20:39 No, I can't tell you when they will reach a decision. We're waiting for a decision like you all are. Pretty much what I can tell you is that, we continue to believe that we have the most predictive score. And so, we're proud of what we've submitted for evaluation. It's -- that's about where we are, we are waiting to hear the results.\nGeorge Tong: 21:08 Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: 21:12 We have question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: 21:18 Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some more details around the large software license deal, whether that was a platform or enterprise deal? Any color will be helpful. Thanks.\nMichael McLaughlin: 21:31 Hi. Ashish, it's Mike. It was mostly platform, not 100%. It's a multi-year deal and -- with what we think is a great customer.\nAshish Sabadra: 21:46 That's great. And I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question. Obviously, the mortgage has worsened compared to your prior guidance. The expectations there have come down, but I was just wondering how have expectations for cars and autos changed since the last guidance? Those seem to be holding up really well and the market there is pretty strong. I was just wondering how do those flow into the updated revenue guidance? Any color will be helpful. Thanks.\nMichael McLaughlin: 22:19 You can see from -- Ashish, it's Mike again. You can see from the external data that auto sales for the first of our two fiscal quarters have been lower than what forecasts were when we set guidance originally. Supply chain being one of the primary reasons for it. And so, relative to the assumption we had for auto, credit originations that was embedded in our guidance last November, we have brought that down a bit to be in line with what best we can triangulate from external forecasts. We continue to be optimistic about credit card and other and personal loan originations, not much change frankly from what we thought was going to unfold when we set the guidance at the beginning of the year and mortgage continues to be negative.\nAshish Sabadra: 23:17 That's very helpful color. Thanks.\nOperator: 23:22 And we have a question from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nJeffery Meuler: 23:27 Yeah, thanks. So we've had a couple of the bureau partners guide to the calendar year mortgage inquiries being down 30% to low 30%. Does your guidance assume something similar?\nWilliam Lansing: 23:42 It assumes something similar, yes. I mean, there's a little bit of a lag with us because we lag the bureaus, but we're affected by some of the same headwinds.\nJeffery Meuler: 23:54 Okay. I know you answered the question on expense management, but can you give us a similar take on the question but in the context of guidance just stands out, how much the adjusted net income guidance has increased relative to the magnitude of the revenue guidance increase? So if you could help us bridge that, that'd be helpful.\nMichael McLaughlin: 24:18 So without getting into too much granular detail, I can give you the buckets that you can think about. First one is COVID related T&E, travel and entertainment, as well as big customer events. We've returned to normal there slower than we expected we would when we set guidance at the beginning of the year. 24:40 We still think that's going to increase in the second half of the year. We know it's going to increase because we have our FICO World event coming up next month and we also had our internal event, what we call Success, last month, actually it was in April, so it hit Q3. So we'll see increases there but relative to what we forecast the beginning of the year, we saw less in Q1 and Q2 and we think we'll continue to see less than we had thought we would in Q3, Q4. 25:11 The second bucket, Will mentioned it, is just reduction in the cost of delivering our SaaS products, COGS for SaaS, as well as other operational improvements that we've been able to achieve, mostly in the software business. We have line of sight on some of them, but we've frankly done a little better than we hoped and so we feel it's appropriate to reflect that in the guidance. 25:34 And then the third bit is, probably not a surprise if you cover other companies in the American economy that hiring is harder these days, just in terms of pace of being able to find people and get them on board. And so, we are hiring rapidly. We think we're getting good people, but it's just happening at a slower pace than we had assumed in the guidance. So, personnel costs are a little bit lower. Those are the three buckets.\nJeffery Meuler: 26:02 Got it. And then just maybe another comment on platform ARR and pipeline. I get that you had a monster sequential growth last quarter, so there is probably some pull forward into Q1, but just maybe if you could comment on the sequential growth or the pipeline, because I think that you said the mega win benefited platform and I would think that benefits platform ARR and it was fairly small sequential growth this quarter, if you could just talk through that. Thanks.\nWilliam Lansing: 26:38 Yeah, it's a fair question. The ARR for that large deal will not hit our reported ARR until next quarter. We have certain definitional rules about when a deal qualifies for ARR and others. We don't want deals that sign at 11:59 in the last day of quarter to boost ARR by millions and millions of dollars. It doesn't seem like it's a fair reflection. So we have a cut off period in ARR that's different than cut off period for ACV bookings or revenue, so you'll see that in the next quarter. 27:08 And also keep in mind that, our business, whether you think about it in ACV bookings terms or ARR terms, is lumpy from quarter to quarter. We did big deals and sometimes they hit in a quarter, sometimes they hit three, four days after the quarter. It was a good quarter, but in terms of the platform deals, we just happened to have a nice chunky one signed a few days ago for Q3. So don't fret too much about the quarter to quarter because of that and then specifically that big deal, it shows up in our revenue recognized at a point in time and ACV bookings disclosure did not hit ARR this quarter.\nJeffery Meuler: 27:47 Okay, thank you.\nOperator: 27:53 And there are no further questions at this time.\nWilliam Lansing: 27:59 Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today. That concludes our call and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you for joining.\nOperator: 28:08 That concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "02:08 Thanks, Steve and thanks to all of you who are joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I'm pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results as we pursue our strategic initiatives in both Scores and Software. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and how we view our business at the midpoint of our fiscal year. 02:36 As you can see on page two of the presentation, we reported revenues of $357 million, which is an increase of 8% over the same period last year. We delivered $104 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, up 52% and 70%, respectively. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $124 million, up 37% and earnings per share of $4.68 were up 53% from last year. 03:08 On the Scores side, the business continues to perform well. Scores were up 9% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page six. On the B2B side, revenues were up 5%. As others have reported, we continue to see a slowdown in mortgage activity as interest rates rise. Mortgage origination revenues were down 23% versus last year. Mortgage revenues account for about 14% of our Scores revenues and 7% of our total company revenues. 03:43 Auto origination revenues were up 9%. Personal loan origination revenues were up 27%. While the mortgage declines have been significant, we do remain confident in our revenues given other areas of strength and pricing increases. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 18% versus the prior-year quarter. We saw strong growth through both our own myFICO business and also through our channel partners. 04:13 In our Software segment, we delivered $173 million of revenue, up 7% from last year. We continue to drive growth in this segment, particularly on our platform. As you can see on page seven, total ARR was up 11% and the platform ARR grew 60%. We continue to deliver strong NRR as well demonstrating our existing customers eagerness to find new ways to expand their usage. 04:40 Total NRR for the quarter, which you can see on page eight, was 110%. Platform NRR was 141%, and we continue to sign more deals and bigger deals. Our ACV bookings, as seen on page nine, were up 55% over last year. I'll have some final comments including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes, but first, I'll turn the call over to Mike for further financial details. 10:17 Thank you, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means that we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is important in a rising rate environment. 10:41 On the software side, we continue to see more evidence that we're on the right strategic path. We've now delivered 10 straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. And we're excited to demonstrate to new and existing customers the best-in-class capabilities that can revolutionize the way they interact with consumers. As always, we remain focused on execution and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we're making. 11:08 Finally, today, we're raising our full-year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.355 billion. As we've noted, we're facing difficult comps in mortgage, but we're seeing strong growth in the unsecured lending markets and in most of our software markets. Some of these trends were anticipated, but there is clearly uncertainty as we move through the next half year.  11:35 We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income as well as EPS. Our GAAP net income is now expected to be $350 million. GAAP earnings per share are now expected to be $13.11. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $429 million and non-GAAP EPS are now $16.08. 12:02 I'll now turn the call back to Steve and we will take the questions. Steve? 13:11 Well, our expenses will be a bit higher in the second half than they were in the first half, but we're doing a pretty good job of managing expenses. Some things like travel and real estate are the kinds of things we expect coming out of COVID. They're still under control and less than they were in the old days. So there is that kind of cost control. 13:33 But I would say that we're also doing a pretty good job on the software side of bringing down our COGS and we're starting to see some benefits from our increasing focus on engineering our products and solutions for cost and efficiency and scaling. And so, all that's coming together and improving our margins. 14:38 It varies by the segment of Scores you're talking about, but there is definitely price benefit in there. Some volumes are down, some volumes are up, but prices offsetting the declines. 14:59 Thank you. 16:32 Well, we take it every year year-by-year and we're committed to consistently increasing our revenue and net income and EPS. We do what we have to do on price to make sure that that remains true. I think, you can expect that from us. It would take fairly calamitous change in the cycle for that to not be true. 16:57 But that's really what goes into figuring out how aggressively we move on price and you've also heard us talk about the pacing and the moderation in the way we go at pricing. We don't want to shock the system. And so it's that balancing act. I think that we put a very high value on consistency of growth. And so, I think you should expect that even as the cycle spins down a little bit, and we do what we have to do on pricing to make that happen. 18:21 George, you know, I talked about this in the past and you know, nobody loves price increases, okay. So, when you say what's the receptivity. I think customers will prefer not to have price increases than they have them, but I think that they expect reasonable and appropriate price increases from us and that's what we deliver and they've been well received. 18:41 We haven't had any significant deflection. We have no major customers leaving us. We have no threat to major customers leaving us. And so, I would say that we've been able to strike a pretty good balance between the price increases that led us consistently drive revenue and earnings without -- again without shocking the system. So, in short, I think, it's a conservative strategy and it's working well on the ecosystem. 19:20 Well, so as I said in the past, we are increasingly trying to spread the price increases in ways that they are less visible to the customers and less visible to you. Our goal in a perfect world would be -- we could even point our fingers at where the price increase happened. 19:40 So there is a fairly elaborate exercise that we do internally to figure out where are the pockets of inelasticity where we can do price increases without losing volume. And so, we do that and we're getting better and better and better at that and that lets us do it in a way that's not nearly as visible and not as easy to describe. So I can't really give you a lot more detail there. 20:16 No, what's your next question, George? 20:39 No, I can't tell you when they will reach a decision. We're waiting for a decision like you all are. Pretty much what I can tell you is that, we continue to believe that we have the most predictive score. And so, we're proud of what we've submitted for evaluation. It's -- that's about where we are, we are waiting to hear the results. 23:42 It assumes something similar, yes. I mean, there's a little bit of a lag with us because we lag the bureaus, but we're affected by some of the same headwinds. 26:38 Yeah, it's a fair question. The ARR for that large deal will not hit our reported ARR until next quarter. We have certain definitional rules about when a deal qualifies for ARR and others. We don't want deals that sign at 11:59 in the last day of quarter to boost ARR by millions and millions of dollars. It doesn't seem like it's a fair reflection. So we have a cut off period in ARR that's different than cut off period for ACV bookings or revenue, so you'll see that in the next quarter. 27:08 And also keep in mind that, our business, whether you think about it in ACV bookings terms or ARR terms, is lumpy from quarter to quarter. We did big deals and sometimes they hit in a quarter, sometimes they hit three, four days after the quarter. It was a good quarter, but in terms of the platform deals, we just happened to have a nice chunky one signed a few days ago for Q3. So don't fret too much about the quarter to quarter because of that and then specifically that big deal, it shows up in our revenue recognized at a point in time and ACV bookings disclosure did not hit ARR this quarter. 27:59 Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today. That concludes our call and we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you for joining."

[Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Thursday, January 27, 2022. And I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteven Weber: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining FICO\u2019s first quarter earnings call. I\u2019m Steve Weber, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Mike McLaughlin. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 on macroeconomic conditions and the company\u2019s business, operations and personnel that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company\u2019s filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company\u2019s earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations website at fico.com or on the SEC\u2019s website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 27, 2023. And I\u2019ll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we\u2019ll be referencing during our presentation today. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year with double digit growth in software ARR and Scores revenue and we continue to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $322 million in Q1 and $85 million of GAAP net income in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $102 million up 25% and earnings per share of $3.70 up 35% from the first prior year quarter. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $124 million, up 66% from the previous year. For the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. We\u2019re off to a good start in our fiscal 2022 and we continue to be very focused on our strategy. In our software business, we continue to focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. When I started at FICO, we had a software business consisting of separate tools and endpoint applications. We evolved that business into a vision of an open and extensible platform uniting advanced analytics, decision modeling and AI. Historically, our software business has been separated by function, allowing us to deepen our expertise in various disciplines, optimize role based resourcing and drive process consistency. This month, we made an important change that better aligns our software organizational structure by integrating our entire software business under Stephanie Covert. Stephanie has led our sales, marketing and services organization where her strong leadership has effectively embraced strategic change, resulting in early wins and a growing pipeline of enterprise platform deals, prioritization of software IP, increased deal level of profitability and clear segmentation of direct and partner channels. I\u2019m confident by placing all elements of our software business under Stephanie\u2019s leadership, as we did years ago with this course business under Jim Wyman will see better alignment, faster and more effective decision making, improved resource allocation against top priorities and stronger end-to-end operational rigor and discipline. Last quarter, we made several important improvements to our external reporting to provide more visibility into the progress we\u2019re making. Today, I\u2019m happy to report that we continue to drive impressive growth in our software ARR as you can see, on pages 7 and 8 of the presentation. Total ARR was up 10% in Q1 and the platform ARR grid rate of 67%. Our net retention rate was also impressive. Total NRR was 109% and platform NRR was 143% and we continue to increase the value of the new deals that we\u2019re signing. As you can see, on page 9 our ACV bookings were up 37% over the same period last year. We are excited about the depth of interest in our platform offering. This quarter we signed a deal with a major U.S. financial institution to use the platform. The multiyear deal is our biggest platform sale-to-date, and it enables the automation of much of the day-to-day customer decisioning using cloud based FICO analytics. In Scores, we\u2019re continuing to innovate and to align our pricing with the value they provide. We had a very good quarter and our Scores segment with strong growth in both B2B and B2C. Scores were up 17% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page 6. On the B2B side revenues were up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. We continue to see a slowed down and mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market were revenues were down about 17% year over year. But that\u2019s more than offset by other areas in the U.S. where revenues growing rapidly. Auto origination revenues were up 27%, card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39%. The fiscal 2022 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January and are not yet in our numbers. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 27% versus the prior year quarter. We saw a strong growth through both our own myFICO.com platform and also through our partner channels. As always, we continue to be focused on shareholder value. Last quarter, I said we would continue to aggressively buyback our shares. I\u2019m pleased to say we repurchased more than 1.2 million shares in our first quarter and more shares in January. Our buybacks reduced the outstanding shares by 9% versus Q1 of last year and this morning, we announced the new $500 million Board repurchase authorization. I\u2019ll add some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for more of financial detail.\nMichael McLaughlin: Thanks William, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we are off to a strong start to our fiscal year driving growth throughout our business. Total revenues for the first quarter was $322 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 9% after adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line last year. In our Scores segment revenues were $169 million up 17% from the same period last year. B2C Scores revenues were up 13% over the prior year. As expected mortgage origination revenues continue to decline down 17% from the same quarter last year. But that was more than offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39% and auto originations revenues were up 27%. B2C Scores revenues were up 27% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner B2C revenues grew significantly. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $153 million down 9% versus the same period last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery business, software revenues were up about 1%. As we\u2019ve discussed for several quarters, we continue to see reduced upfront licensed revenue recognition due to the change we made to our revenue recognition policy for on-prem software licensed subscriptions. And we are seeing reduced professional services revenues as we focus our sales efforts on higher margin software. On-prem software licensed revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time as it is referred to in our 10Q was just $7 million this quarter compared to about $13 million in our Q1 last year. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, down from $41 million in the same period last year. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 12%, and the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Turning to the new software metrics that we introduced last quarter, our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was $547 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $92 million representing 17% of our total first quarter ARR and a growth rate of 67% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the first quarter which was 3% higher than the prior year. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 109% overall. As we said, our non-platform customers\u2019 software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 102% this quarter. On the other hand, our platform customers continued to show very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The DBNRR, a dollar based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the first quarter. Software sales were strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $16.6 million versus $12.1 million in the prior year, an increase of 37%. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $207 million this quarter, a decrease from $225 million in the first quarter last year before accounting for the gain on sale from our ESS product and our JV in China. The year-over-year decrease is due to the divestiture of our collections recovery business, as well as various cost savings implemented in 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 45% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 900 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $85 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter due to a higher effective tax rate in 2022 as a result of lower excess tax benefit and the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. Our GAAP EPS was $3.13, up 5% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $102 million for the quarter, up 25% from the same quarter last year, and our non-GAAP EPS was $3.70, up 35% versus last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, including $6 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $124 million up 66% from last year and for the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.65 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.74%. In December, we issued 550 million in senior notes as an add-on to the 350 million of notes we issued in 2019. We use the proceeds of the notes to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit and to fund the share repurchases. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 1,244,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $397 per share. We repurchased nearly 400,000 additional shares in the month of January which exhausted our current Board authorization. As Will mentioned, we announced today a new $500 million repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 22.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I\u2019m extremely pleased with our Q1 results and the momentum we take into 2022. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth and our diversification through different credit verticals means we\u2019re not dependent on specific types of lending. On the software side, we remain laser focused on our platform strategy and continue to drive strong results. We\u2019ve delivered nine straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We\u2019re confident that we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that\u2019s poised for explosive growth. We remain focused on execution. We\u2019re committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we\u2019re making. We will now turn it back to Steve for Q&A.\nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks. And we\u2019re now ready to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening, guys. Well, maybe just I know you maintained your guidance, which is usually what you\u2019d like to do. But, given the strong quarter just curious if you could just walk us through maybe some of the assumptions for the rest of the year that you\u2019re looking at?\nWilliam Lansing: We\u2019re not changing our guidance, Manav. I mean, we obviously hope that things improve over the year and we\u2019re in a position to do better. But at this time, our guidance is our guidance.\nManav Patnaik: Maybe if you can get on, in terms of the volume assumption and that you gave us some of those origination numbers for the first time. So thank you for that. But just curious how we should think about how you\u2019re thinking of how those trends?\nWilliam Lansing: In origination specifically or just generally I think first quarter is usually our hardest quarter. This quarter we exceeded our internal plan for first quarter. So that\u2019s good news for us. It gives us a lot of optimism about the way the year is going to turn out. But I\u2019m not ready to go out on a limb on volume forecasts.\nManav Patnaik: And then just lastly for me, you mentioned price increases usually start Jan 1st. It\u2019s not in your numbers, but just curious if you could give us any color on if you did, put some of those out and then which areas?\nWilliam Lansing: As we discussed earlier, we have strategic pricing a kind of mixed across the board. It\u2019s not in one particular spot. We did some tier based pricing. Some areas weren\u2019t touched. Other areas were touched a little bit harder and as you know, it\u2019s kind of a once a year event. So we did it and now we watch as it plays out. There\u2019s not any revision to it going on.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKyle Peterson: Good evening guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just want to touch on the platform ARR growth that looked really impressive this quarter. Was that a couple large deals that just kind of happened that kind of fallen into place for you guys or was it more broad based, just any color on the acceleration, it would be great?\nWilliam Lansing: It was a couple of large deals that fell into place, but they weren\u2019t an accident. They were planned and I think it just underlines the fact that we\u2019ve got the right kind of capability, the right kind of platform capability for big enterprise customers. It\u2019s been proven out in the marketplace. We\u2019re seeing the uptake. As you know, for us it\u2019s a land and expand strategy where the platform gets installed and then the customer really focuses on all the incremental use cases that they can get with the platform in place. And so, we love landing the platform in large customers which is kind of what\u2019s happened this quarter and which we anticipate will continue to occur over the year as we go forward.\nKyle Peterson: Great, that\u2019s helpful, and then wondered if you could just touch a little bit on the professional services line. I know, it\u2019s kind of expected to take a leg down sequentially this quarter and are we kind of at the point now where things are leveling off a little bit, and maybe to services kind of trends with kind of the non-platform side of the software business or are there any more near term kind of run offs that we should keep in mind relative to the 1Q run rate of like 26.5 million?\nMike McLaughlin: Hi it\u2019s Mike. I think we are more or less at a run rate, if you want to put it that way. A big part of the decline was the divestiture of a collection recovery business as we disclosed in the 10Q, about $16.3 million of revenue that we had in the first quarter last year that we don\u2019t have this year, about half of that was professional services. The rest of it is a combination of lower bookings. There was a little bit of push out of already contracted PS, which will catch up just schedule issue and milestone issues that are typical with any PS business, but the sort of 26 million a quarter 17%, 18%, 19% of revenue it feels consistent with what we\u2019re the rate at which we\u2019re selling new PS business going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Good afternoon. My first question is about the land and expand strategy. Can you maybe provide a little bit more color in terms of how that actually works out into client? So when they buy the platform, do they tend to pour over existing functionality first, and then kind of build use cases or do they kind of reverse that which is they\u2019ll keep existing functionality from existing products and then maybe build new functionality on the platform? Just trying to understand the way clients are paid.\nMike McLaughlin: It\u2019s a bit of both and depends on the customer. So it\u2019s not a typical for a customer to put the platform in with some fairly specific idea about the use, but is typically not as narrow as our legacy solutions. Typically, the customer will think through a half a dozen or a dozen uses for the platform at the get go and phase the introduction of those different solutions. And then, it\u2019s not uncommon for the customer to figure out within 12 months, within 6 to 12 months that there\u2019s a whole bunch more things they can do with the platform and so they immediately start planning the next phase. And so, what we\u2019re seeing is that the idea of embedding the platform, providing the tools, really is the right strategy for getting incremental business from these customers and for them, it\u2019s a great value proposition because they make the big initial investment. And then, incremental utility comes at very low cost having done so much of the data plumbing and so on. So that\u2019s typical. Sometimes it\u2019s to replace existing functionality. I would say that\u2019s a lot of the time that in the initial that the land piece, but the incremental functionality comes very quickly.\nSurinder Thind: That\u2019s helpful. And then, turning to the B2C business, obviously, solid growth there in terms of the revenues, trying to break that down a little bit further, any color on typically this quarter generally has some $6 million to $7 million of licensing or at least it has the past couple of years. Was that also true this quarter as well in the B2B side of the business?\nWilliam Lansing: No, typically those licenses are in the fourth quarter. You can take that to the bank in any given year, but that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years. And so, Q1 for the last few years has not had a onetime event like that. So it\u2019s a pretty clean quarter over or year-over-year comparison. \nSurinder Thind: And then, just maybe a question on, just color on the quarters volumes, auto revenues actually seem to accelerate or it showed stronger growth, but volumes were actually down quarter-over-quarter. So it was a little confounding or just people looking harder for auto vehicles at this point that\u2019s pushing up overall increase volume or how should we think about that?\nWilliam Lansing: Surinder, when you say volumes are down, are you referring to some external?\nSurinder Thind: I am referring to sales volumes. So obviously, your revenues were in auto pretty meaningfully, I think they were up 19% last quarter, and then 27% this quarter. But when you look at actual sales activity in terms of physical units of vehicles sold both the used market and the new market, those volumes are actually down pretty meaningfully. So kind of reconcile the difference?\nWilliam Lansing: So the data we track, we think there\u2019s pretty good data out there about new card sales. Actual volumes for used card sales is pretty squishy as far as we\u2019re concerned. So really don\u2019t know whether they were up or down. But more or less, let\u2019s call it a push in terms of volumes. Our volumes in terms of Scores and auto, we\u2019re up a little bit. Remember our Scores revenue doesn\u2019t require the card to sell it just require somebody to look for credit. So it\u2019s possible that we could have more volume increase than the actual number cards sold. But if you think about the total revenue increase that was not volume. A little bit of volume contribution as I said, but it was the pricing actions that we\u2019ve taken and how we feathered out through the tiers of the users of that Scores.\nSurinder Thind: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then one clarification on a comment that you made during the prepared remarks about the special price increases. And then I think there was a follow up question about it. I think you use the language that they\u2019re primarily take effect in January, meaning that, is that something like you think kind of roughly 75% will hit this quarter and then maybe another 25 next quarter or is it just the vast majority kind of went into effect on January 1?\nWilliam Lansing: I mean, the vast majority, but we can\u2019t control the timing because some of these things phase in later in the year, but I would say, yes, the majority is upfront.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. \nWilliam Lansing: 75% is probably a little too strong, but more than, a majority, more than half and less than 75%. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. \nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to dive deeper into the Scores special pricing increase. As you did your tier based pricing for this year, how does that increase compare with the prior special pricing increases? Is it consistent? Did you step it up? Step it down? Especially in light of inflationary trends did you keep it consistent or did you step it up? And then how has customer receptivity been so far to these pricing increases?\nWilliam Lansing: I would say consistent with prior years. We didn\u2019t take extra action in light of inflation and inflationary expectation. So, consistent would be the answer to that. And customer reaction is, as it\u2019s always been, knowing those price increases, but they actually understand that the value that we provide, it makes sense what we charge for it. And so, very similar conversations to those we\u2019ve had in the past with our customers which is they understand why we do it. Do they wish that we didn\u2019t raise prices? Of course, they wish they didn\u2019t. Of course, they wish that but they understand us.\nGeorge Tong: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And if you have to quantify on a blended basis, how much that step up is? Where would you place that number that\u2019s consistent with prior years?\nMike McLaughlin: We don\u2019t, we\u2019ve never, I can tell you what you guys plug. But we\u2019ve never provided guidance on the exact amount. It\u2019s been on the order of $50 million I think in your models for years now.\nGeorge Tong: Great. And then with respect to the software business, can you discuss a little bit more about what\u2019s changing with the appointment of Stephanie to the head of the group? How you plan to execute that and what the optimal outcome is of that restructuring in terms of leadership?\nWilliam Lansing: Yes. That\u2019s a great question. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re so focused on execution that we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on this in recent months. Stephanie has been with us for many years. She\u2019s an extremely effective leader. Everything that she\u2019s had, she has just done a phenomenal job with sales and marketing and then we give professional services and she did a great job with that. And now we\u2019ve tucked product and technology underneath her as well. And so she has the entire software business. I think that it will, as I said, it\u2019s going to lead to more streamlined decision making. You could look at it as we have a little more of an SBU, a little more of a business orientation around that business, as opposed to being strictly functionally organized. It used to be the P&L didn\u2019t really roll up until me. Now it rolls up to her. So there\u2019s those benefits, but I think what we really have here is she\u2019s just tremendous leader. And so we\u2019re excited about her having the entire software business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Meuler: Yes, thanks. On platform software pipeline can you help us understand how it\u2019s changing? And I guess, to lead in would be, are you starting to see a lot more large financials in developed markets in the pipeline? I feel like for a while we were hearing about like large lab based financial institutions and then this quarter, there was a call out on a large, U .S. based institution?\nWilliam Lansing: Yes. Look I wouldn\u2019t read too much into what you hear in any one particular quarter. But I would say that we do have a very strong pipeline, software pipeline per platform with major financial institutions all around the globe, not just LATAM, not just North America. This quarter was strong for North America, obviously. But that\u2019s where our direct sales force is putting its energy right now, it\u2019s into our enterprise customers and into getting the platform put in place. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. We\u2019re happy with it. But it doesn\u2019t signal a shift. It\u2019s just this quarter, it was North America and the quarters before LATAM was very strong and I expect to see that shifting around as we go forward. I mean, the pipeline is full of opportunities all over the world.\nJeffrey Meuler: And what\u2019s the typical length of those contracts when you\u2019re winning a client on the platform capabilities?\nWilliam Lansing: Typically around three years, but as you know, you put in the platform and we fully anticipate that the platform will be in for many, many more years, 10 years and beyond, but the typical contract would be three years. \nJeffrey Meuler: Yes. And then last for me, what\u2019s the company\u2019s, I don\u2019t know, steady state leverage target? How much would you go above that? Just obviously, leverage has come up a little but it\u2019s still fairly low with the new repurchase authorizations driving the question. Thank you.\nWilliam Lansing: Well look, we\u2019re as in love with our own stock as we\u2019ve ever been. Can we continue to buy at the pace we\u2019ve been buying? Probably not. We\u2019re quite comfortable with our leverage where it is today, kind of mid twos. We could go higher. Our intent is to spend all of our free cash flow. We have been spending in excess of that. But our intent is always to spend at least our free cash flow. So there is certainly more dry powder, but I don\u2019t think you could count on us buying at the same rate into the indefinite future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on Manav\u2019s question on guidance, which is focused on the EPS guidance. The prior guidance didn\u2019t include buyback and you\u2019ve done significant buyback just year-to-date. I was wondering how should we think about increasing the guidance for those? Is it fair for us to assume that you\u2019ll increase guidance on the second quarter along with special pricing increases?\nWilliam Lansing: I think that if you want to adjust your numbers to reflect our aggressive stock buying recently, you can do that. That\u2019s not a crazy thing to do. But we\u2019re not providing different guidance.\nAshish Sabadra: That\u2019s helpful color. And just given, just wondering if you had any color on the FHFA timeline, and any updated thoughts on that front ? Any color will be helpful. Thanks. \nWilliam Lansing: Yes. So we\u2019ve been following that process. We participate in the process exactly as laid out by law and by the regulators, by the agencies and by the FHFA. And so, we are awaiting the news, such as it is when it comes and they\u2019re really, we don\u2019t have anything else to share right now. We continue to be confident that we have very good product and highly predictive and so on, but I think we just have to wait and see what they do.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time.\nWilliam Lansing: Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes today\u2019s call.\nOperator: That concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and please disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Thanks William, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will said, we are off to a strong start to our fiscal year driving growth throughout our business. Total revenues for the first quarter was $322 million, an increase of 3% over the prior year or 9% after adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery product line last year. In our Scores segment revenues were $169 million up 17% from the same period last year. B2C Scores revenues were up 13% over the prior year. As expected mortgage origination revenues continue to decline down 17% from the same quarter last year. But that was more than offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39% and auto originations revenues were up 27%. B2C Scores revenues were up 27% from the same period last year, both myFICO.com and partner B2C revenues grew significantly. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $153 million down 9% versus the same period last year. Adjusting for the divestiture of our collections and recovery business, software revenues were up about 1%. As we've discussed for several quarters, we continue to see reduced upfront licensed revenue recognition due to the change we made to our revenue recognition policy for on-prem software licensed subscriptions. And we are seeing reduced professional services revenues as we focus our sales efforts on higher margin software. On-prem software licensed revenue recognized upfront or at a point in time as it is referred to in our 10Q was just $7 million this quarter compared to about $13 million in our Q1 last year. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, down from $41 million in the same period last year. This quarter 82% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 12%, and the remaining 6% was from Asia-Pacific. Turning to the new software metrics that we introduced last quarter, our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2022 was $547 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $92 million representing 17% of our total first quarter ARR and a growth rate of 67% versus the prior year. Our non-platform ARR was $455 million in the first quarter which was 3% higher than the prior year. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 109% overall. As we said, our non-platform customers' software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable which is reflected in the non-platform net retention rate of 102% this quarter. On the other hand, our platform customers continued to show very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage. The DBNRR, a dollar based net retention rate for platform was 143% in the first quarter. Software sales were strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings of $16.6 million versus $12.1 million in the prior year, an increase of 37%. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter, total operating expenses were $207 million this quarter, a decrease from $225 million in the first quarter last year before accounting for the gain on sale from our ESS product and our JV in China. The year-over-year decrease is due to the divestiture of our collections recovery business, as well as various cost savings implemented in 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin as shown on our Reg G schedule was 45% for the quarter. We delivered non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 900 basis points over the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $85 million, down 2% from the prior year quarter due to a higher effective tax rate in 2022 as a result of lower excess tax benefit and the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. Our GAAP EPS was $3.13, up 5% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $102 million for the quarter, up 25% from the same quarter last year, and our non-GAAP EPS was $3.70, up 35% versus last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%, including $6 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our FY 2022 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $124 million up 66% from last year and for the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.65 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3.74%. In December, we issued 550 million in senior notes as an add-on to the 350 million of notes we issued in 2019. We use the proceeds of the notes to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit and to fund the share repurchases. Turning to return of capital, we bought back 1,244,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $397 per share. We repurchased nearly 400,000 additional shares in the month of January which exhausted our current Board authorization. As Will mentioned, we announced today a new $500 million repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. With that, I'll turn it back over to Will for his thoughts on FY 22."

            "name": "William Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year with double digit growth in software ARR and Scores revenue and we continue to deliver strong earnings and free cash flow. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $322 million in Q1 and $85 million of GAAP net income in the quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $102 million up 25% and earnings per share of $3.70 up 35% from the first prior year quarter. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well. Q1 free cash flow was $124 million, up 66% from the previous year. For the trailing 12-months free cash flow was $465 million. We're off to a good start in our fiscal 2022 and we continue to be very focused on our strategy. In our software business, we continue to focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. When I started at FICO, we had a software business consisting of separate tools and endpoint applications. We evolved that business into a vision of an open and extensible platform uniting advanced analytics, decision modeling and AI. Historically, our software business has been separated by function, allowing us to deepen our expertise in various disciplines, optimize role based resourcing and drive process consistency. This month, we made an important change that better aligns our software organizational structure by integrating our entire software business under Stephanie Covert. Stephanie has led our sales, marketing and services organization where her strong leadership has effectively embraced strategic change, resulting in early wins and a growing pipeline of enterprise platform deals, prioritization of software IP, increased deal level of profitability and clear segmentation of direct and partner channels. I'm confident by placing all elements of our software business under Stephanie's leadership, as we did years ago with this course business under Jim Wyman will see better alignment, faster and more effective decision making, improved resource allocation against top priorities and stronger end-to-end operational rigor and discipline. Last quarter, we made several important improvements to our external reporting to provide more visibility into the progress we're making. Today, I'm happy to report that we continue to drive impressive growth in our software ARR as you can see, on pages 7 and 8 of the presentation. Total ARR was up 10% in Q1 and the platform ARR grid rate of 67%. Our net retention rate was also impressive. Total NRR was 109% and platform NRR was 143% and we continue to increase the value of the new deals that we're signing. As you can see, on page 9 our ACV bookings were up 37% over the same period last year. We are excited about the depth of interest in our platform offering. This quarter we signed a deal with a major U.S. financial institution to use the platform. The multiyear deal is our biggest platform sale-to-date, and it enables the automation of much of the day-to-day customer decisioning using cloud based FICO analytics. In Scores, we're continuing to innovate and to align our pricing with the value they provide. We had a very good quarter and our Scores segment with strong growth in both B2B and B2C. Scores were up 17% in the quarter versus the prior year as you can see on page 6. On the B2B side revenues were up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. We continue to see a slowed down and mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market were revenues were down about 17% year over year. But that's more than offset by other areas in the U.S. where revenues growing rapidly. Auto origination revenues were up 27%, card and personal loan originations revenues were up 39%. The fiscal 2022 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January and are not yet in our numbers. Our B2C revenues continue to be strong, up 27% versus the prior year quarter. We saw a strong growth through both our own myFICO.com platform and also through our partner channels. As always, we continue to be focused on shareholder value. Last quarter, I said we would continue to aggressively buyback our shares. I'm pleased to say we repurchased more than 1.2 million shares in our first quarter and more shares in January. Our buybacks reduced the outstanding shares by 9% versus Q1 of last year and this morning, we announced the new $500 million Board repurchase authorization. I'll add some final comments in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call over to Mike for more of financial detail. Thanks, Mike. As I said in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our Q1 results and the momentum we take into 2022. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth and our diversification through different credit verticals means we're not dependent on specific types of lending. On the software side, we remain laser focused on our platform strategy and continue to drive strong results. We've delivered nine straight quarters of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We're confident that we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that's poised for explosive growth. We remain focused on execution. We're committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility to the progress we're making. We will now turn it back to Steve for Q&A. We're not changing our guidance, Manav. I mean, we obviously hope that things improve over the year and we're in a position to do better. But at this time, our guidance is our guidance. In origination specifically or just generally I think first quarter is usually our hardest quarter. This quarter we exceeded our internal plan for first quarter. So that's good news for us. It gives us a lot of optimism about the way the year is going to turn out. But I'm not ready to go out on a limb on volume forecasts. As we discussed earlier, we have strategic pricing a kind of mixed across the board. It's not in one particular spot. We did some tier based pricing. Some areas weren't touched. Other areas were touched a little bit harder and as you know, it's kind of a once a year event. So we did it and now we watch as it plays out. There's not any revision to it going on. It was a couple of large deals that fell into place, but they weren't an accident. They were planned and I think it just underlines the fact that we've got the right kind of capability, the right kind of platform capability for big enterprise customers. It's been proven out in the marketplace. We're seeing the uptake. As you know, for us it's a land and expand strategy where the platform gets installed and then the customer really focuses on all the incremental use cases that they can get with the platform in place. And so, we love landing the platform in large customers which is kind of what's happened this quarter and which we anticipate will continue to occur over the year as we go forward. No, typically those licenses are in the fourth quarter. You can take that to the bank in any given year, but that's what we've seen in the last couple of years. And so, Q1 for the last few years has not had a onetime event like that. So it's a pretty clean quarter over or year-over-year comparison. Surinder, when you say volumes are down, are you referring to some external? So the data we track, we think there's pretty good data out there about new card sales. Actual volumes for used card sales is pretty squishy as far as we're concerned. So really don't know whether they were up or down. But more or less, let's call it a push in terms of volumes. Our volumes in terms of Scores and auto, we're up a little bit. Remember our Scores revenue doesn't require the card to sell it just require somebody to look for credit. So it's possible that we could have more volume increase than the actual number cards sold. But if you think about the total revenue increase that was not volume. A little bit of volume contribution as I said, but it was the pricing actions that we've taken and how we feathered out through the tiers of the users of that Scores. I mean, the vast majority, but we can't control the timing because some of these things phase in later in the year, but I would say, yes, the majority is upfront. 75% is probably a little too strong, but more than, a majority, more than half and less than 75%. I would say consistent with prior years. We didn't take extra action in light of inflation and inflationary expectation. So, consistent would be the answer to that. And customer reaction is, as it's always been, knowing those price increases, but they actually understand that the value that we provide, it makes sense what we charge for it. And so, very similar conversations to those we've had in the past with our customers which is they understand why we do it. Do they wish that we didn't raise prices? Of course, they wish they didn't. Of course, they wish that but they understand us. Yes. That's a great question. And as you can imagine, we're so focused on execution that we've spent a lot of time on this in recent months. Stephanie has been with us for many years. She's an extremely effective leader. Everything that she's had, she has just done a phenomenal job with sales and marketing and then we give professional services and she did a great job with that. And now we've tucked product and technology underneath her as well. And so she has the entire software business. I think that it will, as I said, it's going to lead to more streamlined decision making. You could look at it as we have a little more of an SBU, a little more of a business orientation around that business, as opposed to being strictly functionally organized. It used to be the P&L didn't really roll up until me. Now it rolls up to her. So there's those benefits, but I think what we really have here is she's just tremendous leader. And so we're excited about her having the entire software business. Yes. Look I wouldn't read too much into what you hear in any one particular quarter. But I would say that we do have a very strong pipeline, software pipeline per platform with major financial institutions all around the globe, not just LATAM, not just North America. This quarter was strong for North America, obviously. But that's where our direct sales force is putting its energy right now, it's into our enterprise customers and into getting the platform put in place. And that's what's happening. We're happy with it. But it doesn't signal a shift. It's just this quarter, it was North America and the quarters before LATAM was very strong and I expect to see that shifting around as we go forward. I mean, the pipeline is full of opportunities all over the world. Typically around three years, but as you know, you put in the platform and we fully anticipate that the platform will be in for many, many more years, 10 years and beyond, but the typical contract would be three years. Well look, we're as in love with our own stock as we've ever been. Can we continue to buy at the pace we've been buying? Probably not. We're quite comfortable with our leverage where it is today, kind of mid twos. We could go higher. Our intent is to spend all of our free cash flow. We have been spending in excess of that. But our intent is always to spend at least our free cash flow. So there is certainly more dry powder, but I don't think you could count on us buying at the same rate into the indefinite future. I think that if you want to adjust your numbers to reflect our aggressive stock buying recently, you can do that. That's not a crazy thing to do. But we're not providing different guidance. Yes. So we've been following that process. We participate in the process exactly as laid out by law and by the regulators, by the agencies and by the FHFA. And so, we are awaiting the news, such as it is when it comes and they're really, we don't have anything else to share right now. We continue to be confident that we have very good product and highly predictive and so on, but I think we just have to wait and see what they do. Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining today and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. This concludes today's call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 8, 2023.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Dave Singleton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nDave Singleton : Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.  Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and the Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation Schedule G are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through November 8, 2024.  Now I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. \nWilliam Lansing : Thanks, Dave. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.  I am pleased to report we had a strong quarter, which completed another outstanding year with record annual revenues and record earnings, meeting the guidance that we raised last quarter.  Page 2 shows financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported fourth quarter revenues of $390 million, up 12% over the prior year; and $1.514 billion of revenue for the fiscal year, up 10% versus the prior year. We delivered $101 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $4.01.  For the full fiscal year, we delivered $429 million in GAAP net income, which equates to $16.93 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $127 million with earnings of $5.01 per share.  Full year non-GAAP net income was $500 million, up 10% over last year with $19.71 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is up 14% versus the prior year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow with a record $163 million in our fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered $465 million of free cash flow. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share.  In our scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our fourth quarter revenues were $196 million, up 12% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $774 million, up 10% versus last year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 21% versus the prior year and up 18% for the full year. This is a strong result, considering the impact of rising interest rates on loan origination volumes.  On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 6% versus the prior year and down 8% for the full year due to difficult comps. Fourth quarter mortgage origination revenues were up 147% versus the prior year and accounted for 24% of our scores revenues and 12% of our total company revenues. Auto origination revenues were up 2%, while credit card and personal loan origination revenues were down 2% versus the prior year.  We continue to innovate in scores. We're happy to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. This quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage, a top 10 retail mortgage lender, has become an early adopter of FICO Score 10 T. They're using it to analyze their nonconforming loans in conjunction with the classic FICO Scores. As a first-in-market user of FICO Score 10 T, Movement Mortgage will work with FICO to share early-use insights for nonconforming products to help the mortgage industry understand the benefits of the most predictive credit score in the space. Movement Mortgage's use of FICO Score 10 T will provide opportunities to evaluate risk more efficiently in credit positioning.  The improvements in the predictive power of FICO Score 10 T can help lenders avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. And this all occurs without sacrificing the trusted FICO Score minimum scoring criteria and user experience. A more predictive score will help project cash flows with more precision, potentially increasing the value of securitized assets on the secondary market.  In our software segment, we delivered $194 million in Q4 revenue, up 11% from last year. We delivered $740 million in fiscal year revenue, up 10% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage.  As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 22% with platform ARR growing 53% and non-platform ARR growing 14%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 120% with platform NRR at 145% and non-platform NRR at 111%. We continue to see strong demand from new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $94 million, up 10% year-over-year.  There continues to be strong demand for our FICO Platform. We've built a strong pipeline of prospects interested in using this advanced decisioning technology to optimize interactions with our consumer customers. And we continue to be recognized for our technology. Chartis ranked FICO #1 for innovation and risk management technology for the seventh consecutive year, and we're in the top 5 as a risk and compliance technology provider for the second year in a row. Forrester identified FICO as a leader in AI decisioning platform, and Juniper Resources awarded FICO Platform the Future Digital Award for Banking Innovation of the Year.  I'll highlight the fiscal year 2024 guidance in just a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve -- over to Steve for further financial details. \nSteven Weber : Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another outstanding fiscal year, and we are excited about our momentum as we head into fiscal 2024. As Will mentioned, total revenue for the quarter was $390 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Full year revenue of $1.514 billion was up 10% over last year.  Scores revenues for the quarter were $196 million, up 12% from Q4 of 2022. B2B revenues were up 21% driven by mortgage originations as other areas within B2B were relatively flat to the prior year. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year due to primarily to our myFICO.com business, where our B2C partner business was relatively flat compared to the prior year.  For the full year, scores revenues were $774 million, up 10% from the prior year, despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $194 million, up 11% versus Q4 of 2022, with full year software revenues of $740 million, up 10% from the previous year.  This quarter, 85% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 9% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.  Our total software ARR was $669 million, a 22% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $173 million, representing 26% of our Q4 ARR, up from 21% in Q4 of 2022. Platform ARR grew 53% versus the prior year, while non-platform ARR grew 14% and ended the year at $496 million.  Our customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 120% for the total software business. Platform NRR was 145% versus 129% in the prior year, while our non-platform NRR was 111% versus 101% in the prior year. Non-platform was driven by customers' increased usage and some CPI increases.  Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $28 million versus $29 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, Q4 of 2022 contained one very large deal. ACV bookings increased 10% for the full year to $94 million versus $85 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $224 million this quarter versus $215 million in the prior year, an increase of 4%. For the full year, our expenses were $871 million versus $835 million in the prior year, also an increase of 4%.  In fiscal 2024, we maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. In the next year, we'll be focused on investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO Platform. We also plan to invest in cybersecurities to continue to remain a top standard for both the protection of our clients and the FICO assets. The incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 51% both for the quarter and the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 300 basis points for the full fiscal year.  GAAP net income this quarter was $101 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $227 million for the full -- for the quarter, up 30% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $429 million, up 15% from last year. And non-GAAP net income for the current year was $500 million, up 10% from last year.  The effective tax rate for the full year was 22%, including $13 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards, and $9 million reduction associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. We expect our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate to remain around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits and other discrete items.  Free cash flow for the quarter was a record breaking $163 million. For the full year, the free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $170 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.86 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  As Will said, we bought back 136,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $859 per share. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share for a total of $406 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $121 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on fiscal 2024. \nWilliam Lansing : Thanks, Steve. As we enter fiscal 2024, I remain excited about our future. Both our software and scores businesses are best in class, and our continued investment will accelerate our competitive advantage. We continually look for ways to build our brand and expand our outreach.  Last quarter, I talked about our financial literacy efforts. Today, I'd like to discuss the launch of the FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This program, which we've created for students at historically black colleges and universities, features remote mentoring from FICO data scientists and in-person lectures by FICO's Chief Analytics Officer, Dr. Scott Zoldi. The FICO Educational Analytics Challenge is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.  Today, we announced the departure of Stephanie Covert, who has led our software business. Stephanie was instrumental in driving FICO software growth and platform transformation, and we wish her well in her future endeavors.  Before we open for questions, I'll review our fiscal '24 guidance. While we don't break out our segments, we do expect growth in both our scores and software segments. As with prior years, we expect the pricing initiatives in fiscal '24 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact.  Our fiscal 2023 bookings, strong pipeline, recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2024. So today, we're guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings, as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We're guiding revenues of about $1.675 billion, an 11% increase versus last year. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $490 million, an increase of 14%; GAAP EPS of approximately $19.45, an increase of 15%; non-GAAP net income of about $566 million, an increase of 13%; and non-GAAP earnings per share of about $22.45, an increase of 14%.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll take some questions. \nDave Singleton : Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy : So I wanted a little bit more color on 2024 revenues and EPS. One, you mentioned that origination volumes have been slower. It looks like there's been some tightening, but it seems you're confident in the growth around the scores business. It seems that you are taking some pricing on the -- sort of incremental pricing on the mortgage side. So give us some more color around how you're thinking about all those variables around volume and pricing across the various verticals. \nWilliam Lansing : So what our forecast reflects is lower volumes than last year, so a decline versus last year, and roughly flat volumes from the level we're at today. That's how we think about the volume side. And as you know, we take price action for CPI, and sometimes in excess of CPI, every year. And so this year is no different. We will be doing that again. \nFaiza Alwy : Okay. Understood. And then I'm curious on the expense side. Steve, I think you made some mention around moderate increase in expenses. Give us an idea of how we should think about expense growth in 2024. \nSteven Weber : Yes. I mean it is pretty modest. I mean you can -- when you build out your model, you'll see there's some additional expense in there but not a lot. But a lot of it's reprioritization, right? We're looking to invest on the software side. We're putting a lot of money into the platform as we've done, and we're putting money into security to make sure that we're secure as possible. So it's relatively modest. But we definitely are adding some additional investment there from what we've seen in the past few years. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nGeorge Tong : You typically set your rate card in your scores business in the beginning of September. After your scores prices were set, did you notice a negative inflection in credit volumes in September and October, particularly among sub-prime consumers? And if you did, do you believe your scores pricing increases next year are as high as they need to be to sustain your growth momentum? \nSteven Weber : Yes. I mean that's a good question, George. The volatility on the card side can be pretty dramatic and it could be pretty short-lived. So I mean nothing surprised us beyond what -- we saw that coming, right? The sub-prime has been trending down for quite a while. So there's nothing that happened in September that kind of caught us by surprise. So we're satisfied that we have the right rate card in place. \nGeorge Tong : Great. That's good to hear. And then secondly, software ARR growth accelerated to 22% in the quarter from 20% in the prior quarter. Can you elaborate on your overall software platform strategy and the traction that you're seeing with clients? \nWilliam Lansing : Yes. The software strategy is going exactly as expected. We continue to penetrate enterprise platform customers. We've moved to -- we now have 55 of the top 300 financial services customers worldwide on the platform. And that's 55 what we call them EPCs, 55 of these enterprise customers who are using multiple use cases of the platform. If it's just a question of how many have taken the platform, that number is over 100.  And so we have pretty good penetration. As I've shared in the past, we actually expect that the expand side of land and expand is significantly bigger than land. So we land the business, and then our customers find all kinds of new ways to use the platform. And the expansion revenue typically exceeds the land revenue by quite a bit, and that has continued. And that's part of why we're seeing the success that we're seeing. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Margins. \nAshish Sabadra : Just wanted to follow up on that point on the non-platform business. We've seen some pretty robust acceleration there compared to historical levels. There was a call-out on increased usage as well as CPI base pricing. On the usage front, I was wondering if you could provide any incremental color. Is there more modules that are adopted, more feature functionality? And how do we think about this sustainability of this accelerated growth in the non-platform side? \nWilliam Lansing : I would say that most of that is from transaction volume growth. We do invest in features and functionality in our historical products and our legacy products. And so it is all about keeping them up-to-date and useful to our customers.  Again, as we've discussed in the past, the -- many of these solutions go into a customer of lending institution. And they might go in for a 3-year term initially, but they're typically renewed again at the 3-year mark and again at the next 3-year mark. And we can have these solutions operating for 12 years or more. And so it's incumbent on us to maintain the features and functionality, make sure the security is good and the functionalities that our customers want. We do all that. So we're pretty proud of our classic products. But I would say that the increase that you're seeing is largely just volume-related. \nAshish Sabadra : That's very helpful color. And maybe just switching to the special pricing for scores for next year. Our understanding was that mortgage fees were different for Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 institution. And there's a potential for the Tier 1, Tier 2 to start paying the same cycle fees as Tier 3 for fiscal year '24. Is that assumptions appropriate? I was wondering if you can comment on that. \nWilliam Lansing : Yes. We really don't go into the detail around the pricing within the segment. We have studied it, and I think that the price increases that we put into the segment are what are fair and appropriate for the market. We're pretty comfortable we've done the right thing, but we don't go to a lot of detail on that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. \nSeth Weber : For the last several quarters, you've talked about some shortening of the sales cycle. I'm wondering if that -- if you're continuing to see that dynamic and if you could maybe just give us some color on U.S. versus international. \nWilliam Lansing : We are seeing shortening. I mean the sales cycle a year ago was over a year long. And today, it's 2/3 of that. We're very happy with that progress. There's a lot of reasons for it, but it's kind of the cumulative effect of us moving out the process and scaling up, and things are going faster.  I'd also say that the demand is really hot for our offering. The customers are really interested and they're in a hurry to get it going. And it's pretty easy for us to get it up and live. So all those things have contributed to a shorter sales process. And I would say that's true overseas as well as in the U.S. \nSeth Weber : Okay. And then maybe just going back to the expenses again for a second. The fourth quarter software expenses were a little higher than what we were expecting. Did that -- does that already include some of these new investments that you're talking to? Or will these investments be incremental to sort of this fourth quarter run rate? \nSteven Weber : Yes. I mean it's maybe a little bit incremental. We do have some onetime expenses, a lot of our -- around incentives in the fourth quarter that ramps up. And a lot of our people are in software. So you're going to see a little bit higher expense there. But our run rate is not going to increase significantly off of where we -- our exit rate from the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeff Meuler : Can you give us any sense of what you included in the guidance versus what you held back around pricing? For instance, last year, I think you talked about the original guide had the CPI-like pricing increases, but it didn't have the specialty increases. Just any way to help us kind of like understand what's assumed versus what could still be on the come? \nWilliam Lansing : Yes. Jeff, I know you'd love for us to put a number on it. And you know us, we never do. And so it's not going to happen today either. The way we think about it is we look at the volumes, we make our forecast built around the volumes. We put on a CPI increase, and then we put what some people call special pricing, but we have some additional increases beyond CPI. And then because the timing of those is uncertain, we leave some of that out of the guidance.  And so call our guidance conservative. It's designed to reflect the fact that we just don't know how quickly the full-price effect will be ramped into our numbers. And so I hesitate to put any kind of a number on it for you. Is it safe to think about it the way we have in years past? Yes. So think about it the way we do it every year. We haven't changed our methodology. \nSteven Weber : No, I would say the only change is that there's probably more volatility in terms of volumes had in the past. So I mean, if you could tell me what the interest rate is going to be in 6 or 9 months, I could give you a better idea. But I don't think anybody knows that. \nJeff Meuler : That's right. Okay. And then I guess I was surprised to see the departure of Stephany just given how well software has been doing for a while now. Can you just comment on just any, I guess, reasoning why there's a change now, when you expect to have a new leader announced, if they're likely to come as an internal promotion, external? Just any perspective on that would be helpful. \nWilliam Lansing : Yes. Stephanie has done a great job with us. She's done a lot of good things for FICO and for the software business in particular. She decided to pursue other professional opportunities, and so we wish her well with all that.  We -- FICO graduates a lot of talent. I mean it's not -- Stephanie is not the first talent who's left us. And we have a really strong team, and I'm confident that our software business will continue very smoothly.  In terms of leadership, I'm taking over the leadership of the software business directly, so -- which is what I did before Stephanie took it over. And so I'm pretty comfortable with that. Might we have another leader besides me in the future? We might, but that's not the plan right now. So I'm going to run it for the time being, and we'll see. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik : Will, just on the software side, I mean, a lot of good numbers this quarter. You talked a lot about the visibility going into next year. So maybe just help us in terms of the '24 guidance. How should we think about the components of the software growth in there? \nWilliam Lansing : Software business is growing double digit just like the scores business. I mean it's very strong. And where -- it continues to be strong. Where we haven't decelerated in any way in terms of our platform growth rates, which, as you know, were very high. And we -- trees don't grow to the sky, but we expect that to continue for quite some time. I mean there's a lot of demand. The pipeline this year is stronger even than a year ago. And so yes, we're very optimistic. \nSteven Weber : And Manav, the business has changed a lot from the days when we had -- when we were relying on term licenses. So now a lot of the deals -- a lot of the revenue we have visibility to because of the deals are already signed, right? We're just implementing them. So we'll be standing up more of these -- the recurring revenue in the coming quarters.  So we have pretty good line of sight to that. And then there's still a lot of people who are working with from the customer success side to expand their usage. So we're far less dependent on making sure we sign deals at the end of the quarter to pull revenue in. \nManav Patnaik : Got it. And then, Steve, in looking at the EPS guidance, can you just talk about the assumptions there on -- just help us out with share count. I don't think you include additional buybacks, interest expense and maybe any other items that could change year-over-year. \nSteven Weber : Yes. I mean the share count, it's anybody's guess. So we kind of try to leave that relatively flat because that's just kind of upside for us. The interest expense, we've actually done a pretty good job of paying down a little bit of debt on the revolver, so we're saving a little bit there.  We don't have any big plans to really pay that down. We'll probably be maintaining that debt or depending on how the market works, we're sometimes opportunistic if there's a market downturn. So we're basically planning on that to be relatively flat, but we'll react as we always do, depending on what the market conditions look like. \nOperator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to Dave Singleton for closing remarks. Thank you very much. \nDave Singleton : Thanks, everyone, for attending the call, and a great year. \nOperator: And all, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another outstanding fiscal year, and we are excited about our momentum as we head into fiscal 2024. As Will mentioned, total revenue for the quarter was $390 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Full year revenue of $1.514 billion was up 10% over last year.  Scores revenues for the quarter were $196 million, up 12% from Q4 of 2022. B2B revenues were up 21% driven by mortgage originations as other areas within B2B were relatively flat to the prior year. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year due to primarily to our myFICO.com business, where our B2C partner business was relatively flat compared to the prior year.  For the full year, scores revenues were $774 million, up 10% from the prior year, despite sizable headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were $194 million, up 11% versus Q4 of 2022, with full year software revenues of $740 million, up 10% from the previous year.  This quarter, 85% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 9% and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.  Our total software ARR was $669 million, a 22% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $173 million, representing 26% of our Q4 ARR, up from 21% in Q4 of 2022. Platform ARR grew 53% versus the prior year, while non-platform ARR grew 14% and ended the year at $496 million.  Our customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 120% for the total software business. Platform NRR was 145% versus 129% in the prior year, while our non-platform NRR was 111% versus 101% in the prior year. Non-platform was driven by customers' increased usage and some CPI increases.  Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $28 million versus $29 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, Q4 of 2022 contained one very large deal. ACV bookings increased 10% for the full year to $94 million versus $85 million in the prior year. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $224 million this quarter versus $215 million in the prior year, an increase of 4%. For the full year, our expenses were $871 million versus $835 million in the prior year, also an increase of 4%.  In fiscal 2024, we maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. In the next year, we'll be focused on investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO Platform. We also plan to invest in cybersecurities to continue to remain a top standard for both the protection of our clients and the FICO assets. The incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 51% both for the quarter and the full year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 300 basis points for the full fiscal year.  GAAP net income this quarter was $101 million, up 12% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $227 million for the full -- for the quarter, up 30% from the prior year quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $429 million, up 15% from last year. And non-GAAP net income for the current year was $500 million, up 10% from last year.  The effective tax rate for the full year was 22%, including $13 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards, and $9 million reduction associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. We expect our fiscal 2024 effective tax rate to remain around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits and other discrete items.  Free cash flow for the quarter was a record breaking $163 million. For the full year, the free cash flow was $465 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $170 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.86 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 70% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  As Will said, we bought back 136,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $859 per share. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share for a total of $406 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $121 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.

            "name": "William Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.  I am pleased to report we had a strong quarter, which completed another outstanding year with record annual revenues and record earnings, meeting the guidance that we raised last quarter.  Page 2 shows financial highlights from our fourth quarter. We reported fourth quarter revenues of $390 million, up 12% over the prior year; and $1.514 billion of revenue for the fiscal year, up 10% versus the prior year. We delivered $101 million of GAAP net income in the quarter and GAAP earnings of $4.01.  For the full fiscal year, we delivered $429 million in GAAP net income, which equates to $16.93 of earnings per share. On a non-GAAP basis, Q4 net income was $127 million with earnings of $5.01 per share.  Full year non-GAAP net income was $500 million, up 10% over last year with $19.71 of non-GAAP earnings per share, which is up 14% versus the prior year. We continue to deliver strong free cash flow with a record $163 million in our fourth quarter. For the full year, we delivered $465 million of free cash flow. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In fiscal 2023, we repurchased 615,000 shares at an average price of $659 per share.  In our scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our fourth quarter revenues were $196 million, up 12% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $774 million, up 10% versus last year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 21% versus the prior year and up 18% for the full year. This is a strong result, considering the impact of rising interest rates on loan origination volumes.  On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 6% versus the prior year and down 8% for the full year due to difficult comps. Fourth quarter mortgage origination revenues were up 147% versus the prior year and accounted for 24% of our scores revenues and 12% of our total company revenues. Auto origination revenues were up 2%, while credit card and personal loan origination revenues were down 2% versus the prior year.  We continue to innovate in scores. We're happy to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. This quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage, a top 10 retail mortgage lender, has become an early adopter of FICO Score 10 T. They're using it to analyze their nonconforming loans in conjunction with the classic FICO Scores. As a first-in-market user of FICO Score 10 T, Movement Mortgage will work with FICO to share early-use insights for nonconforming products to help the mortgage industry understand the benefits of the most predictive credit score in the space. Movement Mortgage's use of FICO Score 10 T will provide opportunities to evaluate risk more efficiently in credit positioning.  The improvements in the predictive power of FICO Score 10 T can help lenders avoid unexpected credit risk and better control default rates while making more competitive credit offers to more consumers. And this all occurs without sacrificing the trusted FICO Score minimum scoring criteria and user experience. A more predictive score will help project cash flows with more precision, potentially increasing the value of securitized assets on the secondary market.  In our software segment, we delivered $194 million in Q4 revenue, up 11% from last year. We delivered $740 million in fiscal year revenue, up 10% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage.  As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 22% with platform ARR growing 53% and non-platform ARR growing 14%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 120% with platform NRR at 145% and non-platform NRR at 111%. We continue to see strong demand from new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $94 million, up 10% year-over-year.  There continues to be strong demand for our FICO Platform. We've built a strong pipeline of prospects interested in using this advanced decisioning technology to optimize interactions with our consumer customers. And we continue to be recognized for our technology. Chartis ranked FICO #1 for innovation and risk management technology for the seventh consecutive year, and we're in the top 5 as a risk and compliance technology provider for the second year in a row. Forrester identified FICO as a leader in AI decisioning platform, and Juniper Resources awarded FICO Platform the Future Digital Award for Banking Innovation of the Year.  I'll highlight the fiscal year 2024 guidance in just a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve -- over to Steve for further financial details. Thanks, Steve. As we enter fiscal 2024, I remain excited about our future. Both our software and scores businesses are best in class, and our continued investment will accelerate our competitive advantage. We continually look for ways to build our brand and expand our outreach.  Last quarter, I talked about our financial literacy efforts. Today, I'd like to discuss the launch of the FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This program, which we've created for students at historically black colleges and universities, features remote mentoring from FICO data scientists and in-person lectures by FICO's Chief Analytics Officer, Dr. Scott Zoldi. The FICO Educational Analytics Challenge is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.  Today, we announced the departure of Stephanie Covert, who has led our software business. Stephanie was instrumental in driving FICO software growth and platform transformation, and we wish her well in her future endeavors.  Before we open for questions, I'll review our fiscal '24 guidance. While we don't break out our segments, we do expect growth in both our scores and software segments. As with prior years, we expect the pricing initiatives in fiscal '24 to have an additional impact beyond our guided numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact.  Our fiscal 2023 bookings, strong pipeline, recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2024. So today, we're guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings, as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We're guiding revenues of about $1.675 billion, an 11% increase versus last year. We are guiding GAAP net income of approximately $490 million, an increase of 14%; GAAP EPS of approximately $19.45, an increase of 15%; non-GAAP net income of about $566 million, an increase of 13%; and non-GAAP earnings per share of about $22.45, an increase of 14%.  With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll take some questions. So what our forecast reflects is lower volumes than last year, so a decline versus last year, and roughly flat volumes from the level we're at today. That's how we think about the volume side. And as you know, we take price action for CPI, and sometimes in excess of CPI, every year. And so this year is no different. We will be doing that again. Yes. The software strategy is going exactly as expected. We continue to penetrate enterprise platform customers. We've moved to -- we now have 55 of the top 300 financial services customers worldwide on the platform. And that's 55 what we call them EPCs, 55 of these enterprise customers who are using multiple use cases of the platform. If it's just a question of how many have taken the platform, that number is over 100.  And so we have pretty good penetration. As I've shared in the past, we actually expect that the expand side of land and expand is significantly bigger than land. So we land the business, and then our customers find all kinds of new ways to use the platform. And the expansion revenue typically exceeds the land revenue by quite a bit, and that has continued. And that's part of why we're seeing the success that we're seeing. I would say that most of that is from transaction volume growth. We do invest in features and functionality in our historical products and our legacy products. And so it is all about keeping them up-to-date and useful to our customers.  Again, as we've discussed in the past, the -- many of these solutions go into a customer of lending institution. And they might go in for a 3-year term initially, but they're typically renewed again at the 3-year mark and again at the next 3-year mark. And we can have these solutions operating for 12 years or more. And so it's incumbent on us to maintain the features and functionality, make sure the security is good and the functionalities that our customers want. We do all that. So we're pretty proud of our classic products. But I would say that the increase that you're seeing is largely just volume-related. Yes. We really don't go into the detail around the pricing within the segment. We have studied it, and I think that the price increases that we put into the segment are what are fair and appropriate for the market. We're pretty comfortable we've done the right thing, but we don't go to a lot of detail on that. We are seeing shortening. I mean the sales cycle a year ago was over a year long. And today, it's 2/3 of that. We're very happy with that progress. There's a lot of reasons for it, but it's kind of the cumulative effect of us moving out the process and scaling up, and things are going faster.  I'd also say that the demand is really hot for our offering. The customers are really interested and they're in a hurry to get it going. And it's pretty easy for us to get it up and live. So all those things have contributed to a shorter sales process. And I would say that's true overseas as well as in the U.S. Yes. Jeff, I know you'd love for us to put a number on it. And you know us, we never do. And so it's not going to happen today either. The way we think about it is we look at the volumes, we make our forecast built around the volumes. We put on a CPI increase, and then we put what some people call special pricing, but we have some additional increases beyond CPI. And then because the timing of those is uncertain, we leave some of that out of the guidance.  And so call our guidance conservative. It's designed to reflect the fact that we just don't know how quickly the full-price effect will be ramped into our numbers. And so I hesitate to put any kind of a number on it for you. Is it safe to think about it the way we have in years past? Yes. So think about it the way we do it every year. We haven't changed our methodology. Yes. Stephanie has done a great job with us. She's done a lot of good things for FICO and for the software business in particular. She decided to pursue other professional opportunities, and so we wish her well with all that.  We -- FICO graduates a lot of talent. I mean it's not -- Stephanie is not the first talent who's left us. And we have a really strong team, and I'm confident that our software business will continue very smoothly.  In terms of leadership, I'm taking over the leadership of the software business directly, so -- which is what I did before Stephanie took it over. And so I'm pretty comfortable with that. Might we have another leader besides me in the future? We might, but that's not the plan right now. So I'm going to run it for the time being, and we'll see. Software business is growing double digit just like the scores business. I mean it's very strong. And where -- it continues to be strong. Where we haven't decelerated in any way in terms of our platform growth rates, which, as you know, were very high. And we -- trees don't grow to the sky, but we expect that to continue for quite some time. I mean there's a lot of demand. The pipeline this year is stronger even than a year ago. And so yes, we're very optimistic."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, August 2, 2023. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteven Weber: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, FICO's CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing.  Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in the presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 2, 2024.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted slides that offer financial highlights for our third quarter. I am pleased to report we delivered another exceptional quarter with record revenue and profitability and strength throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year.  As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported record revenues of $399 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $129 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.08 per share, growing 38% and 41%, respectively, over the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $143 million, with earnings per share of $5.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and 27%.  We continue to deliver strong results throughout the business. Scores revenue was a record $202 million, up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. As you can see on Page 6 of the presentation, B2B revenues were up 24%, driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 135% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 5%. Credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2%. On B2C, revenues were flat with last quarter and down 11% versus the same period last year. That was due to difficult comps.  In our Software business, we continue to drive growth with FICO Platform, which provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. You can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 20%, a significant milestone for us, and platform ARR growth of 53%. This represents our 15th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We continue to drive strong net retention rates as our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases.  Overall NRR increased to 117%, as shown on Page 8. Legacy off-platform NRR was 109% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform NRR was 142% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land-and-expand strategy.  And we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, we had another quarter of double-digit growth, with ACV bookings up 13% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities and are seeing strong demand for FICO Platform.  We had first-hand confirmation of the critical nature of FICO Platform at our recent FICO World Conference. This is a 3-day event, and it attracted customers for more than 60 countries where they shared best practices, learned about the latest in AI and advanced analytic innovations and learned new approaches for digital transformation. We talked about how FICO Platform can design, build and deliver AI-powered hyper-personalized customer journeys across every touch point and with every interaction.  Personally, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet our customers and hear from them how we're working together to optimize their most difficult decisions. One customer said, \"I knew the FICO Platform had potential to help transform our business from a decision-making perspective, but I'm now blown away by the scope of the platform and communications capabilities.\" Another customer told us, \"FICO doesn't sell software, you sell intelligence. That's way more valuable.\" And yet another customer simply said, \"We either do this now or we fail forever.\" I'm proud of our technological excellence and the team that supports our customers to transform their business.  Finally, I'd like to say a few words about our partnership with Chelsea Football Club, where we're working together to empower students, adults and communities across the U.S. with financial literacy tools and knowledge to make informed credit decisions that last a lifetime. We are hosting fundamental workshops in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation to empower the younger generation with the essential credit knowledge to jump-start their credit journeys.  Financial literacy correlates with better outcomes in education, but we know that the playing field is not always equal. One in 5 U.S. teenagers lack basic financial literacy skills. Around 74% of teams aren't confident in their financial knowledge. We're working on tackling this financial education gap to get more young people in the game.  In each of the 5 cities that Chelsea is playing this summer, we're working with local partners to bring teenagers from traditionally underserved communities to these fundamentals, workshops that are held on or near game day. The students will have an opportunity to attend the Chelsea football game taking place in their city.  For the wider community in these cities, FICO is also hosting Score a Better Future Credit Education events, which are free to the public and will provide local residents with knowledge and tools to gain better insight into their financial health and understanding of their FICO Scores. We know that FICO Scores have allowed much more equitable access to credit, and we're committed to helping educate consumers about processes to foster broader institution.  I'll have some final comments, including an increase in our guidance, in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve for further details.\nSteven Weber: Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very strong quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the third quarter were $399 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $202 million, up 13% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 24% over the prior year, driven by increased originations revenues.  We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 135% from the same quarter last year; auto originations revenues were up 5%; and credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2% over last year. B2B Scores revenues were down 11% from the same period last year, again, due to difficult comps. B2C revenues have been relatively flat throughout FY '23.  Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $197 million, up 16% versus the same period last year. Software recognized over time were $147 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time were $25 million this quarter and represented 13% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $25 million, also representing 13% of total Software revenues.  In the third quarter, 87% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 8%, and 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 was $646 million, a 20% increase over the period the prior year. Our platform ARR was $164 million, up 53% from last year and represented 25% of our total third quarter ARR compared with 20% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew very well and was $482 million in the third quarter, up 11%. And as a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for the divestitures we've made.  Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 117% overall versus 109% last year. We continue to show very strong net expansion from our platform customers due to follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The DB NRR for platform was 142% in the third quarter. Our nonplatform customer software usage also increased this quarter due to increased volumes and CPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 109%.  We had another good quarter of software sales with ACV or annual contract value bookings of $21 million versus $19 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Total operating expenses in the third quarter were $222 million this quarter versus $208 million in the prior year and $221 million in Q2. Third quarter expenses included our FICO World event in May and a onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs that were previously incurred in the previous quarter.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Regulation G schedule, was 53% for the year, a 400 basis point improvement over the previous year. GAAP net income this quarter was $129 million, up 38% from the prior year quarter and included a noncash reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. GAAP EPS of $5.08 was up 41% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $143 million for the quarter, up 24% versus the same quarter last year. And the non-GAAP EPS was $5.66, up 27% from the prior year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and included the adjustment to the valuation of the R&D credit I mentioned earlier. We expect our Q4 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $446 million.  At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at the quarter end was $1.93 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  Turning to return of capital. We bought back 130,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $753 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $237 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY '23 and an increase in our full year guidance.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve. As we finish our fiscal 2023 year, I am extremely pleased with the progress we've made in advancing our strategic initiatives. And I'm bullish on both of the segments of our business. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, and we're dedicated to innovation to face industry challenges in the years to come. And our Software business, through FICO Platform, is enabling customers to use the latest analytics and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions.  Finally, today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $428 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $19.70.  And I'll now turn the call back to Steve, and we'll take some Q&A.\nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks, and we are ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I was hoping, I guess, for my first question, if you would just help us walk through how you thought about the guidance changes. It looked like -- I mean, obviously, you raised it, but it didn't seem like it was the full extent of the beat. So just curious what you're assuming for the last quarter and the variability quarter-to-quarter, I suppose.\nSteven Weber: Yes. You know how we -- Manav, of how we're pretty conservative with the way we guide. And we don't want to be in a situation where we feel like we have to close deals in the last week of the quarter to hit a number. So if we can get a better deal pushing into next year, we're obviously willing to do that.  So we're pretty conservative, and we don't go out and limit any of this. We typically don't guide quarter-to-quarter. As you know, we typically guide full year, and we will update in the middle of the year. So it's a big deal for us to raise guidance with 1 quarter to go, but we thought we pretty much had to. So you can take it how you want. But I mean, we are pretty conservative with where we guide.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then obviously the... .\nSteven Weber: And I will say just one more thing, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Sure.\nSteven Weber: Manav, I will say that we did have some -- a fair amount of onetime license revenue this quarter that we probably may or may not have in the fourth quarter. So we don't want to count on that.\nManav Patnaik: Yes. Fair enough. Okay. And then just on the Scores business, I mean the mortgage origination numbers speak for your pricing efforts there. But can you just tell us where we are on card, auto and the other stuff, like in terms of the pricing strategy there?\nSteven Weber: So I mean, they all had some pricing increases this year, probably more in line with CPI. In terms of volumes, mortgage is still down. We're seeing the same decreases that the bureaus are reporting. Auto was relatively flat year-over-year. And card's actually down a little bit. The originations this quarter are actually down a little bit. So we don't go into a lot more detail now, but you can kind of back into what -- we see the same things that the bureaus see in terms of volumes.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up first on the Software side of the business. You mentioned onetime licensing revenue. And maybe I missed that, but talk to us more about like what drove that? And I know you said you're not counting on that for 4Q. But what were some of the drivers around that?\nSteven Weber: We had some renewals. We had 1 fairly large renewal. If you look at our point-in-time revenue, it was $25 million this quarter. That's a little bit more than we have been trending. So it's not that sizable, but that's a number that can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. So I think it was $20 million a quarter before that.  So those things happen when they happen, and we don't want to be put in a position where we have to have them happen in specific quarters. So we're cautious with where we guide. And that's not much of our business anymore. It used to be 20-plus percent of our business, now it's 10%. So actually, it's less than 10%. So it's a small part of the business, but it's still a meaningful number when you're looking at 1 quarter.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Okay. And so my next question is generally around the Scores business. So with only 1 quarter left, we're looking ahead to next year, and I know you're sort of getting to the time where you start talking about pricing for next year. So curious how you're thinking about that. There's obviously a lot of changes that are supposed to happen in the mortgage space, in particular. So talk to us about any initial thoughts you might have around pricing.\nWilliam Lansing: It really is a little bit early for us to talk about pricing. We're still thinking that through. But I think you can anticipate that there will be continued increases in price, where we think that the market warrants it, where the value we're providing demands it. And in terms of significant changes to the structure of the market and the structure of our pricing, we don't anticipate that.\nSteven Weber: Yes. I mean, I think a lot of those time lines have kind of been pushed already. So we make the decisions based on the information we have at hand, but it's -- other than that, it's difficult to know what's going to happen when.\nWilliam Lansing: I think the thing to keep in mind is this is a big and very important market. And it's important that any kind of changes happen slowly, incrementally and with the ability to anticipate kind of how the market will behave. And so you can expect us to be good players as far as all that goes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: The first question is just around FICO World '23. The conversations that you have with clients there, how quickly do those conversations translate into signed contracts and then eventually revenues? And related to that, how big a source of new customers is that for you?\nWilliam Lansing: So great question. Thanks, Surinder. It's a tremendous source of business for us with existing customers and with new customers. And the speed with which it translates into business is it's actually quite a large continuum. We have deals that get signed at FICO World. I mean, we obviously try to close business on the spot, where appropriate. But then there's other things that just go into the pipeline and then we work the pipeline over the subsequent year.  Our pipeline has been getting shorter. Our pipeline used to be over 400 days. We're down well below that today and continuing to trend downward, which is a good sign. The thing with FICO World is it's really an opportunity for our customers to talk to other customers who have shared problems, shared experience and to really get kind of a real-world feedback from customers who've implemented our software, on how it's worked and what it's done for them and what kind of returns they can expect and the time lines for implementation and so on.  And because of the platform, in particular, is so successful, it's working so well, there's a lot of good stories to be told. And it's obviously way more credible when our customers are telling the story and acting as reference customers than we're out just selling our wares. And so FICO World is a very important event for us to be able to put customers in touch with one another. And frankly, they do the selling. We're there to facilitate.\nSurinder Thind: That's helpful. And then a question about the FHFA time line for just switching over to the new mortgage scores. Any color there in terms of the conversations that you're having with customers or clients at this point in time just to understand whether the time lines are realistic? Are things already being engaged at this point? How should we think about the transition period?\nWilliam Lansing: I think that it's likely that the time lines will be extended. There's additional review going on. And there's obviously a lot of detail that needs to be worked out that wasn't completely worked out at the time of the announcement. And so I think all signs point to a more thoughtful and more drawn out time line.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch a little bit on the guidance raise and kind of where you guys have been kind of seeing upside, at least, kind of year-to-date here, particularly on the Scores side of the business, I guess. Where have things maybe been trending a little better than expected. I mean it seems like mortgage has been notably strong since a lot of that is price. But I guess is there anywhere in the guide, at least, so far, where you guys have been kind of tracking above and is kind of part of what allowed you guys to raise today?\nSteven Weber: I think just what allows us to raise is just more time has gone by, and there's less risk, right? I mean we've already banked 3 quarters' worth of numbers. So entering the year, even at the midway point of the year, there's a lot of questions, and we've gone through the Silicon Valley bank crisis. We've gone through multiple rate increases.  There's been -- if you go back to the start of the year, there's a lot of uncertainty. And we have 3 quarters less of uncertainty now at this point. So we still got another quarter to go, and we'll see. But obviously, we've generated really good numbers to date. That just gives us more confidence in raising the guide.\nKyle Peterson: Great. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up, really, on the platform ARR, another quarter of kind of 50-plus percent year-on-year growth. I'm really impressed to see. Are you guys seeing -- is your customer net kind of widening? It seems like you guys got a lot of traction with some international banks early, but it seems like that might be expanding a little bit or in other kind of related verticals.  But I guess, how should we think about the pipeline and your ability to maintain some of these really robust growth rates, specifically as the law of large numbers kind of kicks in and makes the comps a little harder?\nWilliam Lansing: The growth in the platform is coming from both existing customers and new customers. And we continue to add enterprise customers as we -- as they learn more about what we have to offer and as they talk to their competitors and see what's on offer. And then once it's installed, once implemented, most of our customers find additional uses and wind up increasing volume and increasing use cases over time.  So we're still early days, and we're still adding lots of new customers. Over time, in the fullness of time, I would expect that there'll be more emphasis on the expand piece than the land piece. But for now, it's kind of equal parts, we're seeing both sides of it.  And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have always said that trees don't grow to the sky, and we don't anticipate 50%-plus growth rates forever. But I will say that I'm very pleased that here we are in our 15th quarter, a very high growth for the platform and with no seeming signs of abatement. It's -- the uptake is tremendous. And certainly, our potential market, the potential use cases, very, very large. And so I don't think that we have to -- we're not worried about law of large numbers yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: You now have several months under your belt from when you raised prices in Scores at the beginning of the year. Can you provide an update on customer receptivity to overall pricing actions this year? And what credit volume assumptions for fiscal 4Q are reflected in your full year guide?\nWilliam Lansing: Customer reaction, let me take that one first. I think that our customers find lots of value in the Scores and what they do and recognize that they're a tremendous value. At the same time, no customer likes prices going up. And so as you can imagine, when we raised prices, we hear about it, and discussions go on.  And I think that the numbers speak for themselves. Our customers are very happy with the offering, with the product and with what it does for them. That's kind of how it goes. That's how it's gone for many years, and I don't expect that to change.  We don't -- we won't share our assumptions for next quarter. I think -- and honestly, George, I think I've talked about this before. The way we do this is we roll up all of our numbers and do a forecast and then haircut that with what we're willing to guide. So it's as a percentage of the total number we come up with.  So -- and there's a lot of things that go into that. So it's like running a mining [indiscernible] simulation, right? So we don't have 1 set of expectations for the next quarter. But again, we're conservative with the way we guide to make sure that we'll exceed.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the software side, ARR growth was very strong at 20% this quarter. Can you talk a little bit more about what's fueling that growth acceleration, particularly in this relatively tough macro environment? How much of the growth reflects large bank adoption of your platform solutions, increase in use cases, increase in usage or other factors?\nWilliam Lansing: We had some big deals with existing customers, and then we also added new customers. It's really both.\nSteven Weber: And on the nonplatform side, we had good volume. Obviously, those numbers look good, too, right, so the ARR on the nonplatform side. We had some good volumes on the CCS side and some strong numbers in the Falcon Fraud side as well. So it's pretty much strength throughout the portfolio. And on the platform side, it's just the continued expansion. We had some customers -- big customers go live this quarter, and that's just -- it's new revenue, essentially.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeffrey Meuler: Let me just pick up there. Is there some thought that the nonplatform business has some decent growth potential like you saw this quarter? And then if you could just maybe address if the license step-up in the large renewal was in platform or nonplatform.\nSteven Weber: Yes. I mean, that's hard to say. I mean, we -- I think we had some pent-up volumes coming out of the pandemic, where there's some more activity here. I don't think the off-platform long term is probably going to be a significant growth driver for us. But it's nice to see those numbers perform fairly well.\nJeffrey Meuler: And the license deal?\nSteven Weber: The license -- so the license deal was -- that was a legacy business deal. That was not on the platform. That was a renewal of a legacy deal.\nWilliam Lansing: It's probably worth noting that our legacy software is installed and it winds up having a very, very long life. And we just -- we'd see things renewed kind of every 3 years, and it could be renewed 3x, 4x, 5x. And so I would expect that for our current book of business and on the legacy side, we expect continued renewals, and we expect to be supporting and seeing customer interest in those -- in that software for a very long time to come, usually a decade.  And we haven't abandoned the software, just to be really clear, I mean, legacy has kind of a pejorative flavor to it, which it should not. I mean our legacy software is industry-leading. And it does what it does better than any other software in the market. And our customers know it, and they love it.  And we continue to spend money on innovation there. We continue to spend money, R&D, to make sure that the functionality is as good as it can possibly be. And so as Steve said, we don't look to it as a source of growth, but it's not shrinking either. I mean it's a very solid business.\nSteven Weber: And just one more thing to add to that. So the license deal was a renewal of a term deal. So that's not included in the ARR. So the ARR was driven by volumes, essentially, on CCS and other -- Falcon Fraud, maintenance and volume. So the license deals that -- our term license deals are outside of that.\nJeffrey Meuler: Got it. And then I get that it's early to talk '24 pricing, but maybe if you can just talk about the '23 experience. Like you said, the numbers speak for themselves, and they speak loudly. '23, historically high pricing. So just what did you learn from the experience? And is there the potential that the '23 pricing level could be the new normal going forward after you have some time under your belt on seeing how it resonated?\nWilliam Lansing: Well, I think we'll have -- it's a little bit early to say, and we'll have to see how things unfold. But I think that you can expect continued growth in Scores in both from -- contribution from price and contribution from higher volumes that we anticipate next year.\nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then just last, could you just address AR, and if there was any sort of like new system you implemented, any change in payment terms or if it's just natural variability and when you'd expect kind of the step-up in collections?\nSteven Weber: Yes. It really is not. What it really comes down to, for the most part, is Scores. And we accrue the new revenue, and it takes a while for the payments to come in, right? So you're going to get a little bit of a lag. When it jumps up that quickly, you have -- your AR goes up.  So I think we were asked about that even last quarter about the free cash flow. And we're starting to see more of the free cash flow, flow through now because the AR from last quarter is flowing through today. So it does take a while for that to -- because there's such a significant uptick that it takes a while for it to flush through.\nOperator: And gentlemen, your last question will come from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar.\nRajiv Bhatia: Just on the myFICO business, which you've talked about being a $100 million annual business. I guess, first of all, how much of that business is kind of consumer monthly subscriptions versus consumer onetime reports? And then secondly, how do you think about pricing and pricing elasticities for the myFICO business?\nSteven Weber: I mean the bulk of it is subscriber. It's like monthly subscription. And it's like any other product -- subscription products, a little bit consumer. It depends on what you're selling them and what's involved when included in the package. So we have a really good team that works on that, and they do different packaging at different price points and do a lot of consumer testing.  So it's never static, it's never 1 product at 1 price that's automatically raised at a certain rate. It really is -- it's about understanding the consumers and what the consumers are looking for and bundling different services and products then with that and then testing different price points.\nRajiv Bhatia: And historically, how much pricing have you taken in that business?\nSteven Weber: Yes, we came and looked at that way really because what we do is we end up bundling it -- different products in with it at different price points. So it's not -- it's rarely about a static product that's sold at increased prices. It's usually -- you add more functionality to it or add different tiers with more functionality or more products or services and then you charge more for that.\nWilliam Lansing: I think what's interesting about the business is that almost any consumer who wants to get a free FICO score today can get one. I mean, from their bank -- I mean, it's relatively easy to get your FICO score. And in spite of that, we have a lot of consumers are interested in managing it and monitoring it on a regular basis. And they come and they pay money monthly to subscribe and keep an eye on it.  And obviously, these are the people who are most focused on their financial health, and it's a good service for them. And this has been the case now for years. We've been providing free scores for many, many years now with Open Access, and it hasn't hurt the myFICO business. myFICO business is very strong.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn it back to yourselves for closing remarks. Thank you very much.\nSteven Weber: Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining today. This does conclude our call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks.\nOperator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, FICO's CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing.  Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business.  Certain statements made in the presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.  Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through August 2, 2024.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing. Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very strong quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the third quarter were $399 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. In our Scores segment, revenues were $202 million, up 13% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 24% over the prior year, driven by increased originations revenues.  We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 135% from the same quarter last year; auto originations revenues were up 5%; and credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2% over last year. B2B Scores revenues were down 11% from the same period last year, again, due to difficult comps. B2C revenues have been relatively flat throughout FY '23.  Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $197 million, up 16% versus the same period last year. Software recognized over time were $147 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time were $25 million this quarter and represented 13% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $25 million, also representing 13% of total Software revenues.  In the third quarter, 87% of total revenues were derived from our Americas region, our EMEA region generated 8%, and 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the third fiscal quarter of 2023 was $646 million, a 20% increase over the period the prior year. Our platform ARR was $164 million, up 53% from last year and represented 25% of our total third quarter ARR compared with 20% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew very well and was $482 million in the third quarter, up 11%. And as a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for the divestitures we've made.  Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 117% overall versus 109% last year. We continue to show very strong net expansion from our platform customers due to follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The DB NRR for platform was 142% in the third quarter. Our nonplatform customer software usage also increased this quarter due to increased volumes and CPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 109%.  We had another good quarter of software sales with ACV or annual contract value bookings of $21 million versus $19 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.  Total operating expenses in the third quarter were $222 million this quarter versus $208 million in the prior year and $221 million in Q2. Third quarter expenses included our FICO World event in May and a onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs that were previously incurred in the previous quarter.  Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Regulation G schedule, was 53% for the year, a 400 basis point improvement over the previous year. GAAP net income this quarter was $129 million, up 38% from the prior year quarter and included a noncash reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. GAAP EPS of $5.08 was up 41% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $143 million for the quarter, up 24% versus the same quarter last year. And the non-GAAP EPS was $5.66, up 27% from the prior year.  The effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and included the adjustment to the valuation of the R&D credit I mentioned earlier. We expect our Q4 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $122 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $446 million.  At the end of the quarter, we had $195 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at the quarter end was $1.93 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.  Turning to return of capital. We bought back 130,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $753 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $237 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.  And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY '23 and an increase in our full year guidance. Thanks, Will. This does conclude our prepared remarks, and we are ready now to take your questions. Operator, please open the lines. Yes. You know how we -- Manav, of how we're pretty conservative with the way we guide. And we don't want to be in a situation where we feel like we have to close deals in the last week of the quarter to hit a number. So if we can get a better deal pushing into next year, we're obviously willing to do that.  So we're pretty conservative, and we don't go out and limit any of this. We typically don't guide quarter-to-quarter. As you know, we typically guide full year, and we will update in the middle of the year. So it's a big deal for us to raise guidance with 1 quarter to go, but we thought we pretty much had to. So you can take it how you want. But I mean, we are pretty conservative with where we guide. And I will say just one more thing, Manav. Manav, I will say that we did have some -- a fair amount of onetime license revenue this quarter that we probably may or may not have in the fourth quarter. So we don't want to count on that. So I mean, they all had some pricing increases this year, probably more in line with CPI. In terms of volumes, mortgage is still down. We're seeing the same decreases that the bureaus are reporting. Auto was relatively flat year-over-year. And card's actually down a little bit. The originations this quarter are actually down a little bit. So we don't go into a lot more detail now, but you can kind of back into what -- we see the same things that the bureaus see in terms of volumes. We had some renewals. We had 1 fairly large renewal. If you look at our point-in-time revenue, it was $25 million this quarter. That's a little bit more than we have been trending. So it's not that sizable, but that's a number that can have some variability from quarter-to-quarter. So I think it was $20 million a quarter before that.  So those things happen when they happen, and we don't want to be put in a position where we have to have them happen in specific quarters. So we're cautious with where we guide. And that's not much of our business anymore. It used to be 20-plus percent of our business, now it's 10%. So actually, it's less than 10%. So it's a small part of the business, but it's still a meaningful number when you're looking at 1 quarter. Yes. I mean, I think a lot of those time lines have kind of been pushed already. So we make the decisions based on the information we have at hand, but it's -- other than that, it's difficult to know what's going to happen when. I think just what allows us to raise is just more time has gone by, and there's less risk, right? I mean we've already banked 3 quarters' worth of numbers. So entering the year, even at the midway point of the year, there's a lot of questions, and we've gone through the Silicon Valley bank crisis. We've gone through multiple rate increases.  There's been -- if you go back to the start of the year, there's a lot of uncertainty. And we have 3 quarters less of uncertainty now at this point. So we still got another quarter to go, and we'll see. But obviously, we've generated really good numbers to date. That just gives us more confidence in raising the guide. And on the nonplatform side, we had good volume. Obviously, those numbers look good, too, right, so the ARR on the nonplatform side. We had some good volumes on the CCS side and some strong numbers in the Falcon Fraud side as well. So it's pretty much strength throughout the portfolio. And on the platform side, it's just the continued expansion. We had some customers -- big customers go live this quarter, and that's just -- it's new revenue, essentially. Yes. I mean, that's hard to say. I mean, we -- I think we had some pent-up volumes coming out of the pandemic, where there's some more activity here. I don't think the off-platform long term is probably going to be a significant growth driver for us. But it's nice to see those numbers perform fairly well. The license -- so the license deal was -- that was a legacy business deal. That was not on the platform. That was a renewal of a legacy deal. And just one more thing to add to that. So the license deal was a renewal of a term deal. So that's not included in the ARR. So the ARR was driven by volumes, essentially, on CCS and other -- Falcon Fraud, maintenance and volume. So the license deals that -- our term license deals are outside of that. Yes. It really is not. What it really comes down to, for the most part, is Scores. And we accrue the new revenue, and it takes a while for the payments to come in, right? So you're going to get a little bit of a lag. When it jumps up that quickly, you have -- your AR goes up.  So I think we were asked about that even last quarter about the free cash flow. And we're starting to see more of the free cash flow, flow through now because the AR from last quarter is flowing through today. So it does take a while for that to -- because there's such a significant uptick that it takes a while for it to flush through. I mean the bulk of it is subscriber. It's like monthly subscription. And it's like any other product -- subscription products, a little bit consumer. It depends on what you're selling them and what's involved when included in the package. So we have a really good team that works on that, and they do different packaging at different price points and do a lot of consumer testing.  So it's never static, it's never 1 product at 1 price that's automatically raised at a certain rate. It really is -- it's about understanding the consumers and what the consumers are looking for and bundling different services and products then with that and then testing different price points. Yes, we came and looked at that way really because what we do is we end up bundling it -- different products in with it at different price points. So it's not -- it's rarely about a static product that's sold at increased prices. It's usually -- you add more functionality to it or add different tiers with more functionality or more products or services and then you charge more for that. Great. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining today. This does conclude our call, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks."

            "name": "William Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted slides that offer financial highlights for our third quarter. I am pleased to report we delivered another exceptional quarter with record revenue and profitability and strength throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year.  As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported record revenues of $399 million, an increase of 14% over the same period last year. We delivered $129 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $5.08 per share, growing 38% and 41%, respectively, over the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $143 million, with earnings per share of $5.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% and 27%.  We continue to deliver strong results throughout the business. Scores revenue was a record $202 million, up 13% in the quarter versus the prior year. As you can see on Page 6 of the presentation, B2B revenues were up 24%, driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 135% versus last year. Auto origination revenues were up 5%. Credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were up 2%. On B2C, revenues were flat with last quarter and down 11% versus the same period last year. That was due to difficult comps.  In our Software business, we continue to drive growth with FICO Platform, which provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. You can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 20%, a significant milestone for us, and platform ARR growth of 53%. This represents our 15th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. We continue to drive strong net retention rates as our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases.  Overall NRR increased to 117%, as shown on Page 8. Legacy off-platform NRR was 109% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform NRR was 142% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land-and-expand strategy.  And we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, we had another quarter of double-digit growth, with ACV bookings up 13% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities and are seeing strong demand for FICO Platform.  We had first-hand confirmation of the critical nature of FICO Platform at our recent FICO World Conference. This is a 3-day event, and it attracted customers for more than 60 countries where they shared best practices, learned about the latest in AI and advanced analytic innovations and learned new approaches for digital transformation. We talked about how FICO Platform can design, build and deliver AI-powered hyper-personalized customer journeys across every touch point and with every interaction.  Personally, I enjoyed the opportunity to meet our customers and hear from them how we're working together to optimize their most difficult decisions. One customer said, \"I knew the FICO Platform had potential to help transform our business from a decision-making perspective, but I'm now blown away by the scope of the platform and communications capabilities.\" Another customer told us, \"FICO doesn't sell software, you sell intelligence. That's way more valuable.\" And yet another customer simply said, \"We either do this now or we fail forever.\" I'm proud of our technological excellence and the team that supports our customers to transform their business.  Finally, I'd like to say a few words about our partnership with Chelsea Football Club, where we're working together to empower students, adults and communities across the U.S. with financial literacy tools and knowledge to make informed credit decisions that last a lifetime. We are hosting fundamental workshops in partnership with the U.S. Soccer Foundation to empower the younger generation with the essential credit knowledge to jump-start their credit journeys.  Financial literacy correlates with better outcomes in education, but we know that the playing field is not always equal. One in 5 U.S. teenagers lack basic financial literacy skills. Around 74% of teams aren't confident in their financial knowledge. We're working on tackling this financial education gap to get more young people in the game.  In each of the 5 cities that Chelsea is playing this summer, we're working with local partners to bring teenagers from traditionally underserved communities to these fundamentals, workshops that are held on or near game day. The students will have an opportunity to attend the Chelsea football game taking place in their city.  For the wider community in these cities, FICO is also hosting Score a Better Future Credit Education events, which are free to the public and will provide local residents with knowledge and tools to gain better insight into their financial health and understanding of their FICO Scores. We know that FICO Scores have allowed much more equitable access to credit, and we're committed to helping educate consumers about processes to foster broader institution.  I'll have some final comments, including an increase in our guidance, in a few minutes. But first, let me turn the call back to Steve for further details. Thanks, Steve. As we finish our fiscal 2023 year, I am extremely pleased with the progress we've made in advancing our strategic initiatives. And I'm bullish on both of the segments of our business. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth, and we're dedicated to innovation to face industry challenges in the years to come. And our Software business, through FICO Platform, is enabling customers to use the latest analytics and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions.  Finally, today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the final quarter of our fiscal year. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.5 billion. We are also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $428 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $19.70.  And I'll now turn the call back to Steve, and we'll take some Q&A. It really is a little bit early for us to talk about pricing. We're still thinking that through. But I think you can anticipate that there will be continued increases in price, where we think that the market warrants it, where the value we're providing demands it. And in terms of significant changes to the structure of the market and the structure of our pricing, we don't anticipate that. I think the thing to keep in mind is this is a big and very important market. And it's important that any kind of changes happen slowly, incrementally and with the ability to anticipate kind of how the market will behave. And so you can expect us to be good players as far as all that goes. So great question. Thanks, Surinder. It's a tremendous source of business for us with existing customers and with new customers. And the speed with which it translates into business is it's actually quite a large continuum. We have deals that get signed at FICO World. I mean, we obviously try to close business on the spot, where appropriate. But then there's other things that just go into the pipeline and then we work the pipeline over the subsequent year.  Our pipeline has been getting shorter. Our pipeline used to be over 400 days. We're down well below that today and continuing to trend downward, which is a good sign. The thing with FICO World is it's really an opportunity for our customers to talk to other customers who have shared problems, shared experience and to really get kind of a real-world feedback from customers who've implemented our software, on how it's worked and what it's done for them and what kind of returns they can expect and the time lines for implementation and so on.  And because of the platform, in particular, is so successful, it's working so well, there's a lot of good stories to be told. And it's obviously way more credible when our customers are telling the story and acting as reference customers than we're out just selling our wares. And so FICO World is a very important event for us to be able to put customers in touch with one another. And frankly, they do the selling. We're there to facilitate. I think that it's likely that the time lines will be extended. There's additional review going on. And there's obviously a lot of detail that needs to be worked out that wasn't completely worked out at the time of the announcement. And so I think all signs point to a more thoughtful and more drawn out time line. The growth in the platform is coming from both existing customers and new customers. And we continue to add enterprise customers as we -- as they learn more about what we have to offer and as they talk to their competitors and see what's on offer. And then once it's installed, once implemented, most of our customers find additional uses and wind up increasing volume and increasing use cases over time.  So we're still early days, and we're still adding lots of new customers. Over time, in the fullness of time, I would expect that there'll be more emphasis on the expand piece than the land piece. But for now, it's kind of equal parts, we're seeing both sides of it.  And so, I mean, it's a good story. We have always said that trees don't grow to the sky, and we don't anticipate 50%-plus growth rates forever. But I will say that I'm very pleased that here we are in our 15th quarter, a very high growth for the platform and with no seeming signs of abatement. It's -- the uptake is tremendous. And certainly, our potential market, the potential use cases, very, very large. And so I don't think that we have to -- we're not worried about law of large numbers yet. Customer reaction, let me take that one first. I think that our customers find lots of value in the Scores and what they do and recognize that they're a tremendous value. At the same time, no customer likes prices going up. And so as you can imagine, when we raised prices, we hear about it, and discussions go on.  And I think that the numbers speak for themselves. Our customers are very happy with the offering, with the product and with what it does for them. That's kind of how it goes. That's how it's gone for many years, and I don't expect that to change.  We don't -- we won't share our assumptions for next quarter. I think -- and honestly, George, I think I've talked about this before. The way we do this is we roll up all of our numbers and do a forecast and then haircut that with what we're willing to guide. So it's as a percentage of the total number we come up with.  So -- and there's a lot of things that go into that. So it's like running a mining [indiscernible] simulation, right? So we don't have 1 set of expectations for the next quarter. But again, we're conservative with the way we guide to make sure that we'll exceed. We had some big deals with existing customers, and then we also added new customers. It's really both. It's probably worth noting that our legacy software is installed and it winds up having a very, very long life. And we just -- we'd see things renewed kind of every 3 years, and it could be renewed 3x, 4x, 5x. And so I would expect that for our current book of business and on the legacy side, we expect continued renewals, and we expect to be supporting and seeing customer interest in those -- in that software for a very long time to come, usually a decade.  And we haven't abandoned the software, just to be really clear, I mean, legacy has kind of a pejorative flavor to it, which it should not. I mean our legacy software is industry-leading. And it does what it does better than any other software in the market. And our customers know it, and they love it.  And we continue to spend money on innovation there. We continue to spend money, R&D, to make sure that the functionality is as good as it can possibly be. And so as Steve said, we don't look to it as a source of growth, but it's not shrinking either. I mean it's a very solid business. Well, I think we'll have -- it's a little bit early to say, and we'll have to see how things unfold. But I think that you can expect continued growth in Scores in both from -- contribution from price and contribution from higher volumes that we anticipate next year. I think what's interesting about the business is that almost any consumer who wants to get a free FICO score today can get one. I mean, from their bank -- I mean, it's relatively easy to get your FICO score. And in spite of that, we have a lot of consumers are interested in managing it and monitoring it on a regular basis. And they come and they pay money monthly to subscribe and keep an eye on it.  And obviously, these are the people who are most focused on their financial health, and it's a good service for them. And this has been the case now for years. We've been providing free scores for many, many years now with Open Access, and it hasn't hurt the myFICO business. myFICO business is very strong."

Copies are available from the SEC on the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results with record revenue and growth throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our expectations for the rest of the year. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $380 million, an increase of 6% over the same period last year. We delivered $102 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $4 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $121 million with earnings per share of $4.78. On the Scores side of the business, we continue to perform well. Scores delivered a record quarter with $198 million of revenue, up 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 16% driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 90% versus last year. Auto originations revenues were up 13%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12%. Our B2C revenues continue to face difficult comps, and while up slightly versus last quarter, were down 8% versus the same period last year. In our Software business, our FICO platform provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. We're focused on helping clients maximize the customer experience by predicting, analyzing and optimizing customer interactions in real time to make better customer decisions across the enterprise. These better decisions build trust and loyalty by delivering hyper-personalized experiences through holistic customer management. And the strong results we're delivering demonstrated in the industry hungry for these solutions. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 17% and platform ARR growth of 60%. This represents our 14th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. Again, our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 114%. Legacy platform NRR was 105% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform net retention rate was 146% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land and expand strategy. And we continue to see strong demand for our Software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 16% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as we help our customers to look at strategic mission-critical decisioning as they pursue their digital transformation. Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about our FICO World customer event next month. FICO World attendees will be able to discover how to design, build and deliver a hyper-personalized customer experience across every touch point and within every interaction. Attendees will have access to schedule meetings with FICO's leading thought leaders and experts to discuss best practices and innovative solution designs to solve business challenges. General session presenters at FICO World include leading financial services providers from North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The conference will reveal new products, FICO score alternative data innovations, software capabilities on the FICO platform as well as the company's flagship solutions for AI-powered decisions. We will also announce a new partnership and other new FICO solutions. We'll talk more next quarter about the event and give more details about how leading financial services providers are using the FICO platform to design innovative solutions to solve business challenges. I'll have some final comments, including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me talk -- turn the call over to Steve for further financial details.\nSteven Weber: Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very good quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenue for the second quarter were around $30 million -- $380 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year or 7% when adjusted for divestitures. In our Scores segment, revenues were $198 million, up 8% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 16% over the prior year driven by increased originations revenues. We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card, personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 90% from the same quarter last year. Our originations revenues were up 13%. And credit card and personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12% over last year. B2C Scores revenues were down 8% from the same period last year, as Will explained, due to difficult comps. As a reminder, that was an area that experienced outsized growth during the refinancing boom and peak in our third quarter of fiscal '22 and was up about 1% this quarter versus the first quarter of fiscal '23. Software segment revenues in the second quarter were $182 million, up 5% from the same period last year where we have -- and as a reminder, last year, we had a significant upfront license revenue quarter. Software revenues recognized over time were $136 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time where -- or $19 million this quarter and represented 11% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, representing 15% of total Software revenues. In the second quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 11%, and the remaining 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our Software ARR in the second fiscal quarter of 2023 was $613 million, a 17% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $152 million, up [ 60% ] from last year and represented 25% of our total second quarter ARR compared with 18% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew nicely and was [ $461 ] million in the first quarter, up 7%. As a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The net retention rate for platform was 146% in the second quarter. Our nonplatform customers software usage increased this quarter due to increased volumes and PPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 105%. We had another good quarter of Software sales with annual contract value bookings of $23.3 million versus $20.2 million in the prior year, an increase of [ 16% ]. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning on to expenses for the quarter. Our total operating expenses were $221 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year and $205 million in Q1. Much of the increase was due to salary increases, which took effect in December and [indiscernible] increases. We also had approximately $10 million of nonrecurring expense from a number of small items that were incurred this quarter. We will have some onetime expense from our FICO World event in the third quarter, but we do expect a run rate in the back half of the year to increase slightly from the current levels. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, the same as our first quarter of FY '23. GAAP net income this quarter was $102 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter where, again, we had a large upfront license deal. GAAP EPS of $4 was up 1% from prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $120 million -- $121 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the first quarter last year and non-GAAP EPS was $4.78, up 2% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. We expect our full year 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. [indiscernible] expecting recurring tax rate before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% to 25%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $88 million for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow was $439 million. At the end of the quarter, we had [ $167 ] million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, [ about ] [ 67% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 170,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $684 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $335 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases at an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of fiscal '23 and our revised full year guidance.\nWilliam Lansing: Thank you, Steve. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is very important in a rising rate environment. On the Software side, we continue to prove that market demand for FICO platform is strong and growing. We're delivering valuable technology to customers looking to use the latest analytic and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions and revolutionize their businesses through digital transformation and, importantly, to do it at scale and with low latency. As always, we're focused on execution and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility into our progress. Finally, today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. There's still a great deal of uncertainty in the markets we serve, but we have line of sight to much of our revenue and are confident that we can raise our guidance accordingly. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.48 billion. We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $406 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.15. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $489 million. Non-GAAP EPS is $19.45. And with that, let's turn the call back to Steve for Q&A.\nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: Wanted to talk about the updated revenue guidance of $1.48 billion. Can you walk us through sort of what's changed? Are there areas of the business where you're feeling more positive about versus are there areas where you've maybe changed your view around?\nWilliam Lansing: Well, I think that it's not so much that things have changed as -- with the benefit of half a year behind us, we have more confidence in what we expected. And so we're able -- as you know, we're typically conservative in our guidance. And so we're really just stating officially that we're comfortable with the direction that things are headed. There's not really any surprises there, and there's not any dramatic changes.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. Maybe just a follow-up on expenses. Steve, I know you mentioned something about $10 million of expenses that were more onetime in nature this quarter. Just walk us through sort of what your expectations are for the back half of the year again on expenses.\nSteven Weber: Yes. So we had a number of things that -- a lot of that may take place throughout the year. A lot of it has kind of happened this quarter. We included a little bit more for incentives, which we typically probably don't do to the third quarter. So we did that now. We had the success our sales events. We had a few other kind of true-up things that typically happen throughout the year, but we got more in this quarter. So the rest of the year, I mean, we have FICO World coming in our third quarter. So that's -- there's an expense associated with that. But we expect that, if anything, the expenses in the back half of the year will probably be similar to our second quarter or potentially even drift down in the fourth quarter because there aren't any onetime events there. A lot of that stems on the revenue we did, too. So -- but we don't -- it looks like there's a step function here, but it's not as much as it probably as it looks like on the surface because it's an aggregation of a lot of onetime happening in 1 quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: Will, just a broad macro comment, especially since you're raising your guidance. Just a lot of your peers don't seem to be too worried about the incremental pressure from the bank failures and so forth, but I just wanted to see if you had any unique insight from what you're seeing and how you assess the risks here.\nWilliam Lansing: I wish that I had unique insight to share with you. As you know, our revenues tend to lag the bureaus. They tend to lag -- and so we're not a leading indicator. What we do see is sequentially from last quarter to this quarter, we've stabilized, and we seem to be moving upward a little bit. So that's a positive sign. But I wouldn't say that I have -- that we, FICO, have any kind of unique insight into the future. We certainly haven't felt any fallout right now. We're not sensing any fallout.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the originations revenues, I think we all have a good sense from the bureaus on the mortgage volumes. But I was just hoping you could give us some color on what auto, card and personal loan debt from a volume perspective this quarter.\nSteven Weber: Yes. They were both up. Auto was up a little, not a lot, but it was up year-over-year and current results. We don't need all the details at the [indiscernible], but they were both up at least modestly.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham.\nKyle Peterson: Just wanted to touch on the software side of the business. The ARR, particularly in the platform side, looks really strong this quarter and acceleration at least in terms of the year-on-year growth rate compared to last quarter. I just want to see if you guys could dive into what drove that acceleration, especially kind of in an environment where I think there's a lot of speculation. The bank IT budgets could tighten just with all the ongoing volatility in the market.\nWilliam Lansing: Yes. It's a good question, Kyle. And certainly, the backdrop for IT spending and software is a little softer. There's -- but not for us. So the good news is that our offerings, particularly our platform offering, but our software offerings are so critical. And so March, a part of kind of the strategic future for our big customers that they're not getting the same kind of cancellation and squeeze that some other software products are. We're -- in fact, we've seen our sales cycle shortening a little bit. We see continued expansion of existing sales of platform. And we're actually running into less competition out there than one might expect. Most of the competition comes from homegrown. There's not really competitors out there who have offerings that are on a par with ours. Our platform offering is so much more powerful and fully featured and what the customer needs that it tends to be a less competitive kind of situation and much more of a strategic buy. And so that's really what we're seeing. And so no, we have not slowed down in spite of the software spending environment.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the software side of the business, particularly the talent side of things. I know historically, you guys have kind of been a bit supply constrained per se, kind of having a hard time selling seats in some key roles. Has gotten any easier, given some of the labor market changes, call it, in the last 6 to 8 months, particularly in white-collar tech per se? I just wanted to see if it's got a little easier and maybe a part of that contributing to higher expenses.\nWilliam Lansing: I'd say that we have never had any trouble attracting talent to FICO, not years ago, not last year, not this year, not even when times are tight, when employment is very tight. Yes, there are some salary and cost pressure. And I'd say that's more a year ago than today, but we have had no issues whatsoever with attracting talent or retaining talent for that matter. I think that we offer our engineers and our people super challenging roles. They're working on industries mediating critical stuff, and they like it, and we've been able to track great talent that way. I wouldn't -- with the exception of what Steve mentioned from a salary and stock comp expense standpoint, bonus standpoint, I wouldn't say that there's disproportionate pressure on conferencing or anything like that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies.\nSurinder Thind: I'd like to start with a question on the Scores B2C side of the business. It looked like revenues were sequentially flat quarter-over-quarter versus the declines that you've seen in the last couple of quarters. Any color there in terms of the dynamic? Does it look like things have stabilized at this point and then maybe in terms of the new additions versus the number of people that are rolling off? Any color there?\nWilliam Lansing: I think things have stabilized. It feels like they've stabilized. For myFICO, we've had some success with a free program. And I think for our partners, volumes are stabilizing. So I think that's kind of the general picture there.\nSurinder Thind: Fair enough. And then in terms of just the dollar-based NRR, obviously, there was a material acceleration in the figure from 130% last quarter to 146% this quarter. That reverses the slowing trend that we had been seeing. Can you provide some additional color there? How much of that is sensitivity to FX? And then how much of that is just like the international business there?\nSteven Weber: Yes. Very little of it [indiscernible]. You've got to remember, this is a fairly small number of customers. So a customer coming out and really expanding their use cases can have a pretty dramatic impact when they do that. So I mean you're going to have volatility in both that number and ARR number. But I mean we're seeing pretty much crossed forward with our customers. As they start to use it, they find additional use cases and they drive more volume. So we're really encouraged by that.\nSurinder Thind: And then one follow-on in terms of -- when I think about the new clients that you've been adding to the platform or the new use cases, that's consistently been growing at about a mid-teens pace. That was true last year. That was true this year. It was true through most of 2022. So it doesn't seem like there's really any impact from macro. You've kind of quantified it as there's maybe not a lot of sensitivity there given the importance of the platform. But can you discuss the conversations you're having with the new clients in terms of how you're quoting them? And what does that pipeline look like at this point? Like the conversions that you're seeing or that we're seeing now, is that conversations from last year? Or how -- when I say last year, meaning a year ago. Or how should we think about that in the current pipeline?\nWilliam Lansing: I would say the pipeline is as strong as it has ever been. So it's not like we're working off old pipeline from last year. I think that the future is every bit as bright as the present. So I would just -- I'd lay that out there. The conversations are strategic. So we're operating at a higher level in our customers. We're talking to Chief Digital Officer, the Digital Transformation Officer, the C-suite, the CIO, the Chief Risk Officer. The conversation has been elevated, and that continues to be the case. And I think the couple of things to distinguish our sales approach here are, one, we have something that nobody else has, which the industry very much wants. They want to be able to have this certain industry view of the customer and optimize every interaction and leverage all the data that they know about every consumer to make the smartest kind of an interaction we possibly can. And that's been imperative for the industry. And certainly, the biggest and most forward-thinking banks and lenders are already well down this path, and they see that we have the right offering for that. The other thing is the payback is very rapid. So unlike some of the software that we sold in the past were it'd be a long sales cycle and then it would be a long install and then the payback might take a couple, three years, and then it would get -- the license would be renewed for another three years and another three years. I would say that was kind of the typical software kind of approach five years ago. Today, the payback is extremely rapid. It can be within a year. It could be less than a year. And so what -- and it's very easy to get started. You don't have to commit to a monster project to get started. You can start with one portfolio with one or two or three use cases, see how it goes and then expand from there. And as a result, it's very easy for our customers to give it a try. And when they do it, they try it, and they fall in love with it, and then they expand. And so I think between the very rapid ROI, the very strong references we get from our customers who talk to our would-be customers and the strategic nature, I think those are all the things that are powering us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: With fiscal 2Q now complete, you have visibility into the flow-through of your Scores special pricing increases. Can you discuss the traction of your special pricing increases? And how much of it is reflected in your updated guidance?\nWilliam Lansing: If you're asking is there any special pricing on top of the guidance that we've provided, if that's what you're asking, I would say yes, there is, but we don't quantify it. I mean we really -- there's enough uncertainty out there that we'll know what the special pricing is at the end of the year when the numbers are counted. So I would -- the short version is there is some special pricing above the guidance that we've provided today, but I wouldn't want to quantify it today.\nSteven Weber: Yes. And George, you follow the point out if you realize we're conservative with the way we guide, and we don't want to put the final point on anything. So we [indiscernible] we can. We'll provide more context when we can, but this is pretty much consistent with what we've done in the past years.\nGeorge Tong: And then aside from guidance, just in terms of what's the receptivity and what's the traction of your special pricing increases?\nWilliam Lansing: Well, they go through. We wind up publishing the new prices, and then they go through, and they flow through. And if there were -- if we were to face attrition because of the pricing, I suppose we would start to learn about it now, but we certainly haven't seen anything like that.\nGeorge Tong: Perfect. Very helpful. And then secondly, you mentioned auto and card volumes are up modestly. Can you describe what you're seeing with origination volumes from a trend perspective? How are they trending? I mean things getting better? Are they stable?\nSteven Weber: Yes. Card origination is probably trending down. I mean it's very hot at the end of last year -- next calendar year. It's probably trending down a little bit. But auto has bounced around a lot. It's been pretty stable throughout the last couple of years. But pricing, you probably [indiscernible] data from industry sources that you're going to get from us. And again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Steve, maybe a quick clarification when you talked about the expense growth in the back half of the year. Is that increasing in the back half of the year? Is that excluding the $10 million onetime in the second quarter? Or doesn't include that?\nSteven Weber: No. On a run rate basis, we'll probably be pretty flat to that $10 million or maybe that's probably the high end of what it would be, again, but a lot of kind of how much [indiscernible] get revenue over beyond our guidance. There's some products associated with that. But you can kind of back in on your model, if you take our guidance and see what's the implied expenses in the back half of the year. But personnel was up 6%. I think the personnel were not all that obviously is payroll increase and headcount expansion, so we had some true-ups of some incentives both in the U.S. and other parts of the world. So there's a little bit of -- and we have a number of different kind of onetime things that kind of gets that to $10 million number. So there's a lot of noise in the number. I don't want people to think that our expenses are ramping up that dramatically.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Maybe just a quick question on the FHFA press release that came out on March 23. It mentioned that it currently estimates the buyer credit implementation could occur by first quarter of 2024. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on the implementation.\nWilliam Lansing: Your guess is as good as ours. It has always seemed like a somewhat aggressive timetable to us, but time will tell whether it happens at that time or later. But -- and one could imagine that it could happen on the time frame that's been announced.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird.\nJeff Meuler: So Software looks great. Look forward to seeing you at FICO World, I guess, next month. I do have another question on the guidance methodology. I just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. I think you said, Will, that like you took a similar approach to prior years. There was another question, and it didn't sound like the environment is all that different than what you were expecting. But the magnitude of the increase this year was obviously quite a bit less, at least at the EPS line than some prior years, what you did during Q2. So I'm not understanding if, like, you're holding back more of the pricing benefit this year given uncertainty or if there's offsets in volumes, you mentioned card getting worse or just anything like that? Or is this a pretty full view of the calendar '23 special pricing impact similar to what you've incorporated in prior years with a little bit of conservatism?\nSteven Weber: Yes, I think it's probably more conservatism than we've had in the past because of so much uncertainty, right? I mean you go back a couple of years early pull guidance completely. So I mean there's a lot of uncertainty there. We have a fair amount now as well, but we're obviously dealing in a pretty volatile environment where a lot of our peers are funding their guidance. So we're trying to be as prudent as possible.\nJeff Meuler: Got it. And then just can you comment on free cash flow? I get that it could be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I think we have a couple quarters in a row now where it's a bit lower. So just what's going on there? Or any sense of like when you'd expect that to normalize?\nSteven Weber: I think it'll probably normalize in the back half of the year. I think what happens is you see it both in our accounts receivable. So I think as our Score revenue jumps up, it hit the receivables, and that takes a while hard to flow through to cash. So a lot of that is fairly late in the quarter. So I think you'll probably see a lot more flow through next quarter. There's nothing changing in any of that. So I mean if you look at overall period of time, you'll see [indiscernible].\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I'll turn the call back to your presenters for closing remarks. Thank you.\nSteven Weber: All right. Thank you all for joining today, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. This ends the call.\nOperator: And that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you very much for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Steven Weber",
            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Interim CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate the understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning those uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC on the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through April 27, 2024. And now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing. Thank you. As Will said, we delivered another very good quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenue for the second quarter were around $30 million -- $380 million, an increase of 6% over the prior year or 7% when adjusted for divestitures. In our Scores segment, revenues were $198 million, up 8% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 16% over the prior year driven by increased originations revenues. We drove revenue increases in mortgage, auto and credit card, personal loan and other originations. This quarter, mortgage originations revenues were up 90% from the same quarter last year. Our originations revenues were up 13%. And credit card and personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12% over last year. B2C Scores revenues were down 8% from the same period last year, as Will explained, due to difficult comps. As a reminder, that was an area that experienced outsized growth during the refinancing boom and peak in our third quarter of fiscal '22 and was up about 1% this quarter versus the first quarter of fiscal '23. Software segment revenues in the second quarter were $182 million, up 5% from the same period last year where we have -- and as a reminder, last year, we had a significant upfront license revenue quarter. Software revenues recognized over time were $136 million or 74% of total Software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at a point in time where -- or $19 million this quarter and represented 11% of Software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $27 million, representing 15% of total Software revenues. In the second quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 11%, and the remaining 5% were from Asia Pacific. Our Software ARR in the second fiscal quarter of 2023 was $613 million, a 17% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $152 million, up [ 60% ] from last year and represented 25% of our total second quarter ARR compared with 18% last year. Our nonplatform ARR also grew nicely and was [ $461 ] million in the first quarter, up 7%. As a reminder, all of our ARR numbers have been adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from follow-on sales of new use cases and from increased usage. The net retention rate for platform was 146% in the second quarter. Our nonplatform customers software usage increased this quarter due to increased volumes and PPI increases. The nonplatform NRR was 105%. We had another good quarter of Software sales with annual contract value bookings of $23.3 million versus $20.2 million in the prior year, an increase of [ 16% ]. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales, excluding professional services. Turning on to expenses for the quarter. Our total operating expenses were $221 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year and $205 million in Q1. Much of the increase was due to salary increases, which took effect in December and [indiscernible] increases. We also had approximately $10 million of nonrecurring expense from a number of small items that were incurred this quarter. We will have some onetime expense from our FICO World event in the third quarter, but we do expect a run rate in the back half of the year to increase slightly from the current levels. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, the same as our first quarter of FY '23. GAAP net income this quarter was $102 million, down 3% from the prior year quarter where, again, we had a large upfront license deal. GAAP EPS of $4 was up 1% from prior year. Our non-GAAP net income was $120 million -- $121 million for the quarter, down 2% versus the first quarter last year and non-GAAP EPS was $4.78, up 2% from the prior year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%. We expect our full year 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. [indiscernible] expecting recurring tax rate before any excess tax benefit or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24% to 25%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $88 million for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow was $439 million. At the end of the quarter, we had [ $167 ] million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%. Currently, [ about ] [ 67% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 170,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $684 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $335 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases at an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of fiscal '23 and our revised full year guidance. Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're ready now to take any questions you may have. Operator, please open the line. Yes. So we had a number of things that -- a lot of that may take place throughout the year. A lot of it has kind of happened this quarter. We included a little bit more for incentives, which we typically probably don't do to the third quarter. So we did that now. We had the success our sales events. We had a few other kind of true-up things that typically happen throughout the year, but we got more in this quarter. So the rest of the year, I mean, we have FICO World coming in our third quarter. So that's -- there's an expense associated with that. But we expect that, if anything, the expenses in the back half of the year will probably be similar to our second quarter or potentially even drift down in the fourth quarter because there aren't any onetime events there. A lot of that stems on the revenue we did, too. So -- but we don't -- it looks like there's a step function here, but it's not as much as it probably as it looks like on the surface because it's an aggregation of a lot of onetime happening in 1 quarter. Yes. They were both up. Auto was up a little, not a lot, but it was up year-over-year and current results. We don't need all the details at the [indiscernible], but they were both up at least modestly. Yes. Very little of it [indiscernible]. You've got to remember, this is a fairly small number of customers. So a customer coming out and really expanding their use cases can have a pretty dramatic impact when they do that. So I mean you're going to have volatility in both that number and ARR number. But I mean we're seeing pretty much crossed forward with our customers. As they start to use it, they find additional use cases and they drive more volume. So we're really encouraged by that. Yes. And George, you follow the point out if you realize we're conservative with the way we guide, and we don't want to put the final point on anything. So we [indiscernible] we can. We'll provide more context when we can, but this is pretty much consistent with what we've done in the past years. Yes. Card origination is probably trending down. I mean it's very hot at the end of last year -- next calendar year. It's probably trending down a little bit. But auto has bounced around a lot. It's been pretty stable throughout the last couple of years. But pricing, you probably [indiscernible] data from industry sources that you're going to get from us. And again. No. On a run rate basis, we'll probably be pretty flat to that $10 million or maybe that's probably the high end of what it would be, again, but a lot of kind of how much [indiscernible] get revenue over beyond our guidance. There's some products associated with that. But you can kind of back in on your model, if you take our guidance and see what's the implied expenses in the back half of the year. But personnel was up 6%. I think the personnel were not all that obviously is payroll increase and headcount expansion, so we had some true-ups of some incentives both in the U.S. and other parts of the world. So there's a little bit of -- and we have a number of different kind of onetime things that kind of gets that to $10 million number. So there's a lot of noise in the number. I don't want people to think that our expenses are ramping up that dramatically. Yes, I think it's probably more conservatism than we've had in the past because of so much uncertainty, right? I mean you go back a couple of years early pull guidance completely. So I mean there's a lot of uncertainty there. We have a fair amount now as well, but we're obviously dealing in a pretty volatile environment where a lot of our peers are funding their guidance. So we're trying to be as prudent as possible. I think it'll probably normalize in the back half of the year. I think what happens is you see it both in our accounts receivable. So I think as our Score revenue jumps up, it hit the receivables, and that takes a while hard to flow through to cash. So a lot of that is fairly late in the quarter. So I think you'll probably see a lot more flow through next quarter. There's nothing changing in any of that. So I mean if you look at overall period of time, you'll see [indiscernible]. All right. Thank you all for joining today, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you. This ends the call."

            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. On the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some slides that offer financial highlights of our second quarter. I am pleased to report that we continue to deliver strong results with record revenue and growth throughout our business. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our expectations for the rest of the year. As you can see on Page 2 of the presentation, we reported revenues of $380 million, an increase of 6% over the same period last year. We delivered $102 million of GAAP net income and GAAP earnings of $4 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $121 million with earnings per share of $4.78. On the Scores side of the business, we continue to perform well. Scores delivered a record quarter with $198 million of revenue, up 8% in the quarter versus the prior year, as you can see on Page 6. On the B2B side, revenues were up 16% driven primarily by increased originations revenues. Mortgage originations revenues were up 90% versus last year. Auto originations revenues were up 13%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were up 12%. Our B2C revenues continue to face difficult comps, and while up slightly versus last quarter, were down 8% versus the same period last year. In our Software business, our FICO platform provides the power of analytics and AI to enable smarter business decisions at scale. We're focused on helping clients maximize the customer experience by predicting, analyzing and optimizing customer interactions in real time to make better customer decisions across the enterprise. These better decisions build trust and loyalty by delivering hyper-personalized experiences through holistic customer management. And the strong results we're delivering demonstrated in the industry hungry for these solutions. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 17% and platform ARR growth of 60%. This represents our 14th straight quarter of platform ARR growth in excess of 40%. Again, our customers continue to increase volumes and find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 114%. Legacy platform NRR was 105% as volumes grew in many of our customers. Platform net retention rate was 146% due to expanded use cases driven by the success of our land and expand strategy. And we continue to see strong demand for our Software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 16% over the same period last year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as we help our customers to look at strategic mission-critical decisioning as they pursue their digital transformation. Finally, I'd like to talk a little bit about our FICO World customer event next month. FICO World attendees will be able to discover how to design, build and deliver a hyper-personalized customer experience across every touch point and within every interaction. Attendees will have access to schedule meetings with FICO's leading thought leaders and experts to discuss best practices and innovative solution designs to solve business challenges. General session presenters at FICO World include leading financial services providers from North America, Latin America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The conference will reveal new products, FICO score alternative data innovations, software capabilities on the FICO platform as well as the company's flagship solutions for AI-powered decisions. We will also announce a new partnership and other new FICO solutions. We'll talk more next quarter about the event and give more details about how leading financial services providers are using the FICO platform to design innovative solutions to solve business challenges. I'll have some final comments, including a revision of our guidance in a few minutes. But first, let me talk -- turn the call over to Steve for further financial details. Thank you, Steve. As I said in my opening remarks, we continue to deliver strong results, and I have confidence in our team as we move forward. Our Scores business continues to deliver strong growth even in a volatile macro environment. As I've said in the past, our diversification through different credit verticals means we're less dependent on specific types of lending, which is very important in a rising rate environment. On the Software side, we continue to prove that market demand for FICO platform is strong and growing. We're delivering valuable technology to customers looking to use the latest analytic and AI technology to optimize their consumer interactions and revolutionize their businesses through digital transformation and, importantly, to do it at scale and with low latency. As always, we're focused on execution and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and visibility into our progress. Finally, today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the back half of our fiscal year. There's still a great deal of uncertainty in the markets we serve, but we have line of sight to much of our revenue and are confident that we can raise our guidance accordingly. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.48 billion. We're also increasing our GAAP and non-GAAP net income guidance. GAAP net income is now expected to be $406 million. GAAP earnings per share is now expected to be $16.15. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $489 million. Non-GAAP EPS is $19.45. And with that, let's turn the call back to Steve for Q&A. Well, I think that it's not so much that things have changed as -- with the benefit of half a year behind us, we have more confidence in what we expected. And so we're able -- as you know, we're typically conservative in our guidance. And so we're really just stating officially that we're comfortable with the direction that things are headed. There's not really any surprises there, and there's not any dramatic changes. I wish that I had unique insight to share with you. As you know, our revenues tend to lag the bureaus. They tend to lag -- and so we're not a leading indicator. What we do see is sequentially from last quarter to this quarter, we've stabilized, and we seem to be moving upward a little bit. So that's a positive sign. But I wouldn't say that I have -- that we, FICO, have any kind of unique insight into the future. We certainly haven't felt any fallout right now. We're not sensing any fallout. Yes. It's a good question, Kyle. And certainly, the backdrop for IT spending and software is a little softer. There's -- but not for us. So the good news is that our offerings, particularly our platform offering, but our software offerings are so critical. And so March, a part of kind of the strategic future for our big customers that they're not getting the same kind of cancellation and squeeze that some other software products are. We're -- in fact, we've seen our sales cycle shortening a little bit. We see continued expansion of existing sales of platform. And we're actually running into less competition out there than one might expect. Most of the competition comes from homegrown. There's not really competitors out there who have offerings that are on a par with ours. Our platform offering is so much more powerful and fully featured and what the customer needs that it tends to be a less competitive kind of situation and much more of a strategic buy. And so that's really what we're seeing. And so no, we have not slowed down in spite of the software spending environment. I'd say that we have never had any trouble attracting talent to FICO, not years ago, not last year, not this year, not even when times are tight, when employment is very tight. Yes, there are some salary and cost pressure. And I'd say that's more a year ago than today, but we have had no issues whatsoever with attracting talent or retaining talent for that matter. I think that we offer our engineers and our people super challenging roles. They're working on industries mediating critical stuff, and they like it, and we've been able to track great talent that way. I wouldn't -- with the exception of what Steve mentioned from a salary and stock comp expense standpoint, bonus standpoint, I wouldn't say that there's disproportionate pressure on conferencing or anything like that. I think things have stabilized. It feels like they've stabilized. For myFICO, we've had some success with a free program. And I think for our partners, volumes are stabilizing. So I think that's kind of the general picture there. I would say the pipeline is as strong as it has ever been. So it's not like we're working off old pipeline from last year. I think that the future is every bit as bright as the present. So I would just -- I'd lay that out there. The conversations are strategic. So we're operating at a higher level in our customers. We're talking to Chief Digital Officer, the Digital Transformation Officer, the C-suite, the CIO, the Chief Risk Officer. The conversation has been elevated, and that continues to be the case. And I think the couple of things to distinguish our sales approach here are, one, we have something that nobody else has, which the industry very much wants. They want to be able to have this certain industry view of the customer and optimize every interaction and leverage all the data that they know about every consumer to make the smartest kind of an interaction we possibly can. And that's been imperative for the industry. And certainly, the biggest and most forward-thinking banks and lenders are already well down this path, and they see that we have the right offering for that. The other thing is the payback is very rapid. So unlike some of the software that we sold in the past were it'd be a long sales cycle and then it would be a long install and then the payback might take a couple, three years, and then it would get -- the license would be renewed for another three years and another three years. I would say that was kind of the typical software kind of approach five years ago. Today, the payback is extremely rapid. It can be within a year. It could be less than a year. And so what -- and it's very easy to get started. You don't have to commit to a monster project to get started. You can start with one portfolio with one or two or three use cases, see how it goes and then expand from there. And as a result, it's very easy for our customers to give it a try. And when they do it, they try it, and they fall in love with it, and then they expand. And so I think between the very rapid ROI, the very strong references we get from our customers who talk to our would-be customers and the strategic nature, I think those are all the things that are powering us. If you're asking is there any special pricing on top of the guidance that we've provided, if that's what you're asking, I would say yes, there is, but we don't quantify it. I mean we really -- there's enough uncertainty out there that we'll know what the special pricing is at the end of the year when the numbers are counted. So I would -- the short version is there is some special pricing above the guidance that we've provided today, but I wouldn't want to quantify it today. Well, they go through. We wind up publishing the new prices, and then they go through, and they flow through. And if there were -- if we were to face attrition because of the pricing, I suppose we would start to learn about it now, but we certainly haven't seen anything like that. Your guess is as good as ours. It has always seemed like a somewhat aggressive timetable to us, but time will tell whether it happens at that time or later. But -- and one could imagine that it could happen on the time frame that's been announced."

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded Thursday, January 26, 2023. And now I'd like to turn the conference over to Steve Weber. Please go ahead.\nSteve Weber: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Interim CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 26, 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we will be referencing through our presentation today. I'm pleased with the results we delivered in our first fiscal quarter. Even in these uncertain economic times, the resilience of our assets and the execution of our team allow us to deliver steady growth in both revenues and earnings and value to our shareholders. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $345 million in Q1, up 7% from the prior year. Our GAAP net income of $98 million was up 15% over the prior year and GAAP EPS of $3.84, up 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $108 million, up 6% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $4.26 were up 15% from the prior year quarter. Overall, we are off to a very good start in our fiscal 2023. In Scores, revenues were up 5% over the same period last year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. B2B revenues were up 11% in the quarter versus the prior year, driven by unit price increases, increased volumes in card and personal loan originations, and also by a license renewal in Latin America. In the U.S., auto originations revenues were up 24% and card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19%. We continue to see reduced mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market, where revenues were down about 40% year-over-year. The fiscal 2023 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January. So we expect to see much of the impact in our second fiscal quarter. As always, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year quarter as we continue to see difficult comps in our myFICO business due to the economic climate and especially because of the higher interest rates and lower number of consumers preparing for mortgages. In our software business, we continue our focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. Overall software numbers look strong, and platform numbers continue to be exceptional. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 11% and platform ARR growth of 46%. Our ARR, our DBNRR and our ACV numbers are adjusted for the Siron divestiture. And again, our customers continue to find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 110%, and platform net retention is 130%, continuing to demonstrate the success of our land-and-expand strategy, and we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 31% over the same period last year, and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as customers look to FICO to deliver strategic mission-critical decisioning. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend our annual sales meeting, where I met with colleagues from around the world to discuss best practices, current trends and especially how our customers view our offerings. I heard firsthand how customers were looking at FICO to help solve their most difficult decisions and how those customers were increasingly finding new ways to use the FICO platform throughout their businesses. I don't think there's ever been a time at FICO where the team has been so excited about the opportunities ahead of us. And I share that excitement. I came away with a renewed appreciation for our unique technological capabilities and the incredible team that we have taking it to the market. Finally, as I've often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. The strategic focus has allowed us to exit some non-strategic products and services over the last few years. In November, we announced we had reached an agreement to transition our Siron compliance business to our partner, IMTF. We closed that transaction in December. While we are proud of the work and the innovation at the FICO team put into Siron to make it an industry-leading solution, we believe we are better positioned if we dedicate our focus and our resources to expanding the capabilities and market penetration of FICO platform. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, let me turn the call back to Steve for more financial detail. Thanks.\nSteve Weber: As Will said, we delivered another solid quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the first quarter were $345 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year and slightly ahead of our internal plan. In our Scores segment, revenues were $178 million, up 5% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 11% over the prior year. As has been the case for several quarters, mortgage originations revenues were down from the previous year. This quarter, those revenues were down 40% from the same quarter last year and 29% from Q4. But again, that was offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19% over last year, and auto originations revenues were up 24%. We also renewed a multi-year license, which had a positive impact on the quarter. B2C Scores revenues were down 6% from the same period last year, and we expect B2C revenues to be down modestly from current levels throughout the rest of the fiscal year. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $167 million, up 9% versus the same period last year. Software revenues recognized over time were $133 million or 80% of total software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at any point in time, were $12 million this quarter and represented 7% of software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $22 million, representing 13% of total software revenues. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 9%, and the remaining 6% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $583 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $133 million, up 46% last year and represented 23% of our total first quarter ARR compared with 17% last year. Our non-platform ARR was $450 million in the first quarter, up 4% when adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 110% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The net retention per platform was 130% in the fourth quarter. Our non-platform customer software usage has matured and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 103%. Software sales were again strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings at $21.5 million versus $16.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 31%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $205 million this quarter versus $207 million in the prior year and $215 million in Q4. While we continue to focus on expense efficiency, we do expect our total expenses to trend up in FY 2023 from salary increases and modest headcount increases. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, representing a 400 basis point non-GAAP margin expansion versus the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $98 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $108 million for the quarter, up 6% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% and included $10 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our full-year fiscal 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $471 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $166 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 180,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $418 per share. We have $451 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY 2023.\nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve. I'm really pleased with our Q1 results. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on strategic initiatives, and I'm pleased with our positioning for the balance of fiscal 2023. Our Scores business continues to deliver growth even in a turbulent market. As I said in the past, our diversification across different credit verticals means that we are not dependent on one specific type of lending. On the software side, our platform strategy continued to drive strong results. The strategic mission-critical nature of our decisioning FICO platform means that customers are not delaying purchases and implementations. This is evident in the 13 straight quarters of 40-plus percent of platform ARR growth and the continued strong net retention rate of current customers. We are confident we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that's poised for sustained growth. I'm confident we have the correct strategy and a strong team in place to deliver on the remarkable opportunities ahead. As always, we remain focused on execution, and we are committed to delivering outstanding value for our shareholders. As a reminder, when we announced our CFO transition, we also reiterated our guidance with an adjustment for the transition of the Siron Compliance Solution to our partner. So we are guiding revenues of $1.463 billion, GAAP net income of $401 million, GAAP EPS of $16, non-GAAP net income of $487 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $19.42. I'll turn the call back to Steve, and we'll be taking questions.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. When you presented your fiscal 2023 guidance last quarter, you had assumed Scores revenue growth of 7% composed entirely of pricing increases and flat origination volumes. One quarter into fiscal 2023, does that assumption still hold on your end? Or are you seeing anything that could challenge those trends?\nWilliam Lansing: I think the assumption still holds. The future remains uncertain, but right now, the assumption holds. We think we're right on track.\nGeorge Tong: Great. Switching to the software side. ARR year-over-year growth accelerated in fiscal 4Q from fiscal 3Q, and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that customer demand remains strong. Can you, overall, just elaborate on the overall spending environment for enterprise software? And if you're seeing any second derivative slowdown in spend?\nWilliam Lansing: So as I mentioned, I think that because the platform software is so mission-critical, it's a little bit less subject to our customers pulling in their budgets and pulling in their spend. So there's no question that there is budget pressure out there. I mean everyone is under budget pressure. But the kinds of solutions we provide with the platform are such a perfect fit for the strategic needs of some of these customers that it's something that just can't wait. And so when the customers adopt a platform, it's a transformation of their business really, and it's not the kind of thing that's easy to put off. The other thing I would say is we're demonstrating incredibly rapid return on investment. And we have testimonials from customers with amazing returns, within year returns. And that word is getting around. Our customers are finding out that this stuff pays for itself within a year. And as a result, we have not seen any slowdown in the spend on our platform business.\nGeorge Tong: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. I'd like to start with a question on the Scores business. Can you provide any other additional color on kind of the licensing deals or the magnitude of that? When I kind of think about what volumes were, the B2B revenues came in a bit higher than I was anticipating. So any color on how licensing deals compare this year to last year in terms of the revenue impact?\nWilliam Lansing: I would say that the license deal that we referenced is kind of par for the course. We get these deals from time to time, renewal deals, sometimes they're bigger renewal deals. They happen every year. We can't really predict what quarter they happen in, and so we get a little bit of lumpiness there, and that's what we've got here.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of the B2C business. I think you mentioned that maybe you're expecting some modestly lower revenues on a go-forward basis. Is the expectation just of sequential declines on a quarter-over-quarter basis throughout the year at this point? Or any color that you can help us provide on how to think about the amount of drag that perhaps there might be on a go-forward basis?\nSteve Weber: Yes. Surinder, this is Steve. It's relatively modest that we see right now. I mean, a piece of that business is, as you know, there is a partner side and then the myFICO side. The myFICO side has been challenged by the economic environment, right. In fact that people and I getting pay mortgages, if mortgages increase in the spring and breaking them down and that increase that our business will probably pick back up again. But it looks right now, we're projecting it to be a little bit less than it is today, but we're not expecting to be [indiscernible].\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And just a clarification on that, Steve. So is the partner side holding steady at this point? Or \u2013 and it's \u2013 the drag is mostly from the myFICO side?\nSteve Weber: Yes, it's mostly on the myFICO side because the myFICO side is more \u2013 the partners have a lot of different business models they can cycle off to, right? There's a premium [indiscernible] MyFICO side, we don't set what market it is. It's a lot more tied to each market.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then one quick question on just capital allocation. The stock has obviously performed really well over the past year and especially over the previous quarter. So does this still kind of make sense to be fully allocating all of your free cash flow towards share repurchases? Or should we start to think about maybe paying down some of the floating rate debt at this point?\nWilliam Lansing: We're still in love with our stock, and the plan is to continue to return capital to shareholders through stock repurchase. That said, we'll keep an eye on rates. And we're at a weighted 4.9% on the interest expense right now. And I just \u2013 when I look at FICO stock, when you look at FICO stock, I think you believe that's a better \u2013 that's a good balance. So for now, still on stock buyback.\nSurinder Thind: Understood. That\u2019s all with my questions.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kyle Peterson with Needham & Company. Please go ahead your line is open.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks, guys. So I just wanted to get your, like, sense of appetite. I guess, like you guys just mentioned FICO stock is really attractive. But how are you guys feeling about the buyback and capital allocation in this environment? And kind of if you could rank order, Steve, your like use of capital, that would be really helpful?\nSteve Weber: Yes. Okay, Kyle, that\u2019s a good question. So one of the things we're really working on hard, frankly, is we're bringing back as much cash as we can from around the world. Even if there's a slight expense to that when the rates are higher, it just makes more sense to do that as much as possible. So that we're bringing as much cash into the U.S. as we can. And then we look at the trade-offs between the rates and to put what kind of stock we can buy back. So as Will said, we're concentrating on buybacks, but that can change as the markets change. So we look at that, we model it out. And we're still comfortable that buying as many shares back as we can conceivably. We're not going to do like we did last year where we went all in, and we ratcheted up our debt when we said we had the opportunity. But I think you'll see us spending the free cash flow this year on buybacks.\nKyle Peterson: Yes. I mean, that makes sense. And I mean I think you guys went hog-wild on it last year, but like, yes, we're all about that. But I guess like just as we're thinking into the next year, is there anything different? Or should we expect more or less cash flow? I guess that the messaging from you guys historically has been, cash flow is \u2013 it's your money and shareholders' and not ours, and we want to return that if we can't find a better use of that. But is there any different messaging? Or is it more of the same with you at helm, at least for now?\nWilliam Lansing: Look, I think Steve said it well. I mean, we try to return free cash flow every year. And then periodically, we do more than that. So for the last two years, we've done considerably more than that. And it's because the stock price was depressed, like really, in our minds, quite depressed relative to its value, and also it was a lower interest rate environment. Now we have higher interest rate environment. The stock is a little bit price here. I still think it's a bargain, but it's more expensive than it was. And so we're back to thinking about stock repurchase in terms of our free cash flow, our annual free cash flow. So I would say that things have changed. I mean we were really piling up the debt to buy in the shares over the last two years, and we will not be quite as aggressive in the future, at least right now under these circumstances.\nSteve Weber: And again, two-thirds of our debt is fixed. So we have no rate risk there at all, so even with the rates increasing. So we're just talking about the variable rate, and we're happy with where it is right now, but we continue to monitor it. And if rates were to go up significantly, then we'd probably pair back the buybacks. But it's always just the calculus we have to do.\nKyle Peterson: Yes. Makes ton of sense. Thanks guys. Nice quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Please go ahead your line is open.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. On the Auto and Card side, you gave us \u2013 you showed some healthy revenue increases. But I was hoping you could just help us parse down what volumes are doing in those two categories? And the flat volume assumption for overall volumes in Scores, I guess what are you assuming for Auto and Card to get to that flat number?\nSteve Weber: Yes. So right now, Auto is relatively flat. It's up some months and down some months, but it's relatively flat. Card is still up. It's been probably decelerating, but it's still up. So most of the increase year-over-year on revenues on the Auto side came from pricing. Most of the increase on the Card side came from volumes. Not 100%, but most of it was. So as we go forward now, next quarter, we'll have the benefit of the new price increases. So it \u2013 there's a lot of different variables in there. So it's hard to really say what we're expecting in terms of overall volumes because there's a lot of different tiers involved, and there's different pricing tiers. So you have to really dig under the covers to see all of that. But we're not seeing anything in the market that's really changing the way we looked at it when we issued guidance three months ago. Mortgage is probably a little bit weaker than it was then, but we knew it was going to be weak. So none of that really surprises us. We'll see how things progress in the next couple of quarters. If housing pricing comes down and the rates are down a little bit and that market picks up, then we'll get some more acceleration there. But right now, we're pretty much tracking to what we thought we would see three months ago.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Helpful. And then, Will, just on the Software side, the platform business always had a five handle. Next is, in terms of growth, I know it's probably just nitpicking. This time, it's 46%, but even in your prepared remarks, you said 40% plus type growth. Is it just the law of large numbers? Is there something timing-wise? Just talk to us a little bit around that, please?\nSteve Weber: It's a little bit of both. So we knew we were never going to be able to keep the 70% number, right? So now we've been 50%, now we're a little less than 50%. Looking at the rest of the year, we think we'll probably be in that high 40s to low 50s percent. So there is some timing around some of these things. But we don't see it really decline. I mean, it's declined for the last few quarters, but we think we're pretty comfortable operating in this range, give or take a few points.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on the special pricing. Our understanding is that tends to be in the $40 million to $60 million range usually. Is that the expectation this time as well based on initial feedback as you have ruled out these special pricing increases?\nWilliam Lansing: We never confirmed that number. It's \u2013 and so I won't be doing it today. There is still some special pricing, but I can't confirm a number for you today.\nSteve Weber: It's easier to do in hindsight. There's a lot of volatility, right, in the marketplace. So if you can tell us what the interest rates are going to be in six months, we can probably give you a better number.\nAshish Sabadra: Okay. That's fair. Maybe just a follow-up question on portfolio rationalization. Is it fair to assume that the Siron divestiture could also potentially help on the growth profile? And are there other opportunities for portfolio rationalization within the software portfolio?\nWilliam Lansing: I would say yes and no. So yes, our platform growth rate is substantially higher than the Siron business that we divested. And so divesting it does contribute to a higher growth rate for FICO. And are there other opportunities in our portfolio? Not really. I mean never say never. We're always looking to be as streamlined and efficient as we possibly can be. But we're pretty happy with the set of assets and the set of solutions that we have today. Even our older application solutions are still quite popular with our customers. We continue to invest in them and make sure that they have the features and functionality that the market needs. And as you know, the renewals on these typically have a cycle of kind of three years, and they get renewed multiple times. It could be a nine-year or 12-year kind of arrangement. And so I think we'll be probably hanging on to the vast majority of our portfolio. There are no obvious candidates for divestiture at this time.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. And maybe if I can sneak in one last question on the B2C side. As you mentioned, some of it is tied to the mortgage weakness. But I was wondering if there's anything that you can do from a product perspective or a marketing perspective in order to improve or moderate the headwinds that are causing from the weak mortgage market on the B2C side?\nWilliam Lansing: Well, I can share you that our talented management team is doing everything they can on the marketing side and the customer acquisition side to keep the business growing as much as possible. But you do have a macro environment that just results in the kind of performance that you're seeing right now. That business is completely data-driven science-based kind of a business where we spend on customer acquisition up to where it ceased to be economically smart to do so. And so there's \u2013 that is always optimized. That business is optimized at whatever levels we have in the marketplace. And so the short answer to your question is we're doing just the right amount. I really think it's optimized. I don't know that more would make things better. You might be able to get the growth rate up, but it wouldn't be better from an economic standpoint.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi, thank you. So first, I just wanted to pick on a comment that you made saying that you thought revenues were ahead of plan. Maybe you could talk about what areas in particular were better than your expectations in the quarter?\nSteve Weber: Yes. I mean it was modest, but it was on the software side. I mean, the Scores number is pretty much dead on plan, and software came in a little bit ahead of plan. So it's encouraging to see that, that happen.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Great. And then on the software side, I'm curious how we should think about the non-platform revenues. I think previously, you had talked about those revenues being roughly flat. And they are. They were down just a little bit on a year-over-year basis. I'm talking about the recurring revenue. Like is that \u2013 like \u2013 so that $450 million, is that sort of the right way to think about it going forward? Or do you expect sort of more \u2013 some declines from here in that business?\nWilliam Lansing: I think someday we will have declines, but I think for the time being, flat is the right way to think about it. Now obviously, we can manage that number. We choose to end of life some products, and that contributes to shrinkage. And it's a balancing. And it's really a balancing act that we are in. I think that we're in a good place right now at flat. That's just about the right balance where we can close down, end of life the products that would result in us having a lot of technical debt where we did continue them without really shrinking that business. The day will come, no doubt, when we will shrink that business somewhat. But that day is still a ways away.\nFaiza Alwy: Got it. And then just on expenses. I think you mentioned that expenses are going to go up a little bit as we go through the year, mostly driven by personnel expenses. And I'm curious, is that something that's \u2013 something that's already put in motion? Or maybe want to talk about the magnitude of that increase, if you can? And secondly, like how much flexibility you have on that, should the planned revenues don't come in line. Is that something you can pull back on?\nSteve Weber: It's not \u2013 it's not a lot of money. But I mean, we put \u2013 we have salary increases that take place in December. So we'll have three full quarters of that. There'll probably be some additions to headcount, but we expect to have more revenues, too. So I mean, we can delay the headcount hires if the revenues don't come in. So we do have control over it to some degree, but it's not a step function in expenses.\nFaiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeff Meuler with Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: It is [indiscernible] on for Jeff. I was just hoping to get a little color on some of the nonorigination B2B scores, and particularly, the marketing and prescreen side of things. How is that trending...\nSteve Weber: Yes. Prescreen is down slightly from last quarter. Some of that is seasonal. But we still see pretty strong pre-stream numbers, but they're not what they were in the fall. So we'll see what happens after the first of the year. Typically, that's a lower marketing quarter, but we monitor that, and we'll see. It's still strong, but it's not as strong as it was in the fall.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then...\nSteve Weber: In terms of the account management scores, the account review scores, those were actually stronger. So for \u2013 there's a lot of different factors looked on that, but it's a little bit stronger than it was in the prior quarters.\nUnidentified Analyst: Appreciate that. And then on the software side of things, is there a usage component that benefited in the quarter? Or is it just strong growth?\nSteve Weber: There's some usage. I mean, it's a combination. Most of the platform, especially, it's all based off the usage. So it can either be increased usage of the same functionality or additional use cases that are brought on board.\nUnidentified Analyst: But is there like, I guess, a transactional or is there a revenue benefit to, like I said, the increased usage that's specifically...\nSteve Weber: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And that concludes our Q&A session for today. It also concludes the call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Steve Weber",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Steve Weber, Interim CFO, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison to the prior quarter in order to facilitate understanding of the run rate of our business. Certain statements made in this presentation may be characterized as forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these uncertainties is contained in the Company's filings with the SEC, in particular, in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the Company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. A replay of this webcast will be available through January 26, 2024. Now I'll turn the call over to Will Lansing. As Will said, we delivered another solid quarter in both our Scores and Software segments. Total revenues for the first quarter were $345 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year and slightly ahead of our internal plan. In our Scores segment, revenues were $178 million, up 5% from the same period last year. B2B Scores revenues were up 11% over the prior year. As has been the case for several quarters, mortgage originations revenues were down from the previous year. This quarter, those revenues were down 40% from the same quarter last year and 29% from Q4. But again, that was offset by growth in other areas. Credit card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19% over last year, and auto originations revenues were up 24%. We also renewed a multi-year license, which had a positive impact on the quarter. B2C Scores revenues were down 6% from the same period last year, and we expect B2C revenues to be down modestly from current levels throughout the rest of the fiscal year. Software segment revenues in the first quarter were $167 million, up 9% versus the same period last year. Software revenues recognized over time were $133 million or 80% of total software revenues. License revenues recognized upfront or at any point in time, were $12 million this quarter and represented 7% of software revenues. Our professional services revenues were $22 million, representing 13% of total software revenues. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region. Our EMEA region generated 9%, and the remaining 6% were from Asia Pacific. Our software ARR in the first fiscal quarter of 2023 was $583 million, an 11% increase over the prior year quarter. Our platform ARR was $133 million, up 46% last year and represented 23% of our total first quarter ARR compared with 17% last year. Our non-platform ARR was $450 million in the first quarter, up 4% when adjusted for divestitures. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 110% overall versus 109% last year. Our platform customers continue to show very strong net expansion from land-and-expand follow-on sales and increased usage. The net retention per platform was 130% in the fourth quarter. Our non-platform customer software usage has matured and relatively stable with retention this quarter at 103%. Software sales were again strong this quarter with annual contract value bookings at $21.5 million versus $16.4 million in the prior year, an increase of 31%. And as a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales, excluding professional services. Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $205 million this quarter versus $207 million in the prior year and $215 million in Q4. While we continue to focus on expense efficiency, we do expect our total expenses to trend up in FY 2023 from salary increases and modest headcount increases. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown on our Reg G schedule, was 49% for the quarter, representing a 400 basis point non-GAAP margin expansion versus the same period last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $98 million, up 15% from the prior year quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $108 million for the quarter, up 6% from the same quarter last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% and included $10 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We expect our full-year fiscal 2023 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25% to 26%. That expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefits or other discrete items. The resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24%. Free cash flow for the quarter was $92 million. For the trailing 12 months, free cash flow was $471 million. At the end of the quarter, we had $166 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.92 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 4.9%. Currently, about 67% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 180,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $418 per share. We have $451 million remaining on the current Board authorization, and we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of FY 2023. Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we are now ready to take your questions. Operator, please open the line. Yes. Surinder, this is Steve. It's relatively modest that we see right now. I mean, a piece of that business is, as you know, there is a partner side and then the myFICO side. The myFICO side has been challenged by the economic environment, right. In fact that people and I getting pay mortgages, if mortgages increase in the spring and breaking them down and that increase that our business will probably pick back up again. But it looks right now, we're projecting it to be a little bit less than it is today, but we're not expecting to be [indiscernible]. Yes, it's mostly on the myFICO side because the myFICO side is more \u2013 the partners have a lot of different business models they can cycle off to, right? There's a premium [indiscernible] MyFICO side, we don't set what market it is. It's a lot more tied to each market. Yes. Okay, Kyle, that's a good question. So one of the things we're really working on hard, frankly, is we're bringing back as much cash as we can from around the world. Even if there's a slight expense to that when the rates are higher, it just makes more sense to do that as much as possible. So that we're bringing as much cash into the U.S. as we can. And then we look at the trade-offs between the rates and to put what kind of stock we can buy back. So as Will said, we're concentrating on buybacks, but that can change as the markets change. So we look at that, we model it out. And we're still comfortable that buying as many shares back as we can conceivably. We're not going to do like we did last year where we went all in, and we ratcheted up our debt when we said we had the opportunity. But I think you'll see us spending the free cash flow this year on buybacks. And again, two-thirds of our debt is fixed. So we have no rate risk there at all, so even with the rates increasing.

And if rates were to go up significantly, then we'd probably pair back the buybacks. But it's always just the calculus we have to do. Yes. So right now, Auto is relatively flat. It's up some months and down some months, but it's relatively flat. Card is still up. It's been probably decelerating, but it's still up. So most of the increase year-over-year on revenues on the Auto side came from pricing. Most of the increase on the Card side came from volumes. Not 100%, but most of it was. So as we go forward now, next quarter, we'll have the benefit of the new price increases. So it \u2013 there's a lot of different variables in there. So it's hard to really say what we're expecting in terms of overall volumes because there's a lot of different tiers involved, and there's different pricing tiers. So you have to really dig under the covers to see all of that. But we're not seeing anything in the market that's really changing the way we looked at it when we issued guidance three months ago. Mortgage is probably a little bit weaker than it was then, but we knew it was going to be weak. So none of that really surprises us. We'll see how things progress in the next couple of quarters. If housing pricing comes down and the rates are down a little bit and that market picks up, then we'll get some more acceleration there. But right now, we're pretty much tracking to what we thought we would see three months ago. It's a little bit of both. So we knew we were never going to be able to keep the 70% number, right? So now we've been 50%, now we're a little less than 50%. Looking at the rest of the year, we think we'll probably be in that high 40s to low 50s percent. So there is some timing around some of these things. But we don't see it really decline. I mean, it's declined for the last few quarters, but we think we're pretty comfortable operating in this range, give or take a few points. It's easier to do in hindsight. There's a lot of volatility, right, in the marketplace. So if you can tell us what the interest rates are going to be in six months, we can probably give you a better number. Yes. I mean it was modest, but it was on the software side. I mean, the Scores number is pretty much dead on plan, and software came in a little bit ahead of plan. So it's encouraging to see that, that happen. It's not \u2013 it's not a lot of money. But I mean, we put \u2013 we have salary increases that take place in December.

            "content": "Thanks, Steve, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some slides that we will be referencing through our presentation today. I'm pleased with the results we delivered in our first fiscal quarter. Even in these uncertain economic times, the resilience of our assets and the execution of our team allow us to deliver steady growth in both revenues and earnings and value to our shareholders. Page 2 shows financial highlights from our first quarter. We reported revenues of $345 million in Q1, up 7% from the prior year. Our GAAP net income of $98 million was up 15% over the prior year and GAAP EPS of $3.84, up 24%. On a non-GAAP basis, Q1 net income was $108 million, up 6% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $4.26 were up 15% from the prior year quarter. Overall, we are off to a very good start in our fiscal 2023. In Scores, revenues were up 5% over the same period last year, as you can see on Page 6 of the presentation. B2B revenues were up 11% in the quarter versus the prior year, driven by unit price increases, increased volumes in card and personal loan originations, and also by a license renewal in Latin America. In the U.S., auto originations revenues were up 24% and card and personal loan originations revenues were up 19%. We continue to see reduced mortgage origination volumes for the U.S. market, where revenues were down about 40% year-over-year. The fiscal 2023 price increases we talked about last quarter take effect primarily in January. So we expect to see much of the impact in our second fiscal quarter. As always, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of the impact. Our B2C revenues were down 6% versus the prior year quarter as we continue to see difficult comps in our myFICO business due to the economic climate and especially because of the higher interest rates and lower number of consumers preparing for mortgages. In our software business, we continue our focus on the decisioning platform that enables businesses to optimize consumer interactions across their enterprise. Overall software numbers look strong, and platform numbers continue to be exceptional. As you can see on Page 7, we delivered overall ARR growth of 11% and platform ARR growth of 46%. Our ARR, our DBNRR and our ACV numbers are adjusted for the Siron divestiture. And again, our customers continue to find new use cases, as you can see from our net retention rates shown on Page 8. Overall, net retention rate was 110%, and platform net retention is 130%, continuing to demonstrate the success of our land-and-expand strategy, and we continue to see strong demand for our software. As you can see on Page 9, our ACV bookings were up 31% over the same period last year, and we continue to see a strong pipeline of opportunities as customers look to FICO to deliver strategic mission-critical decisioning. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to attend our annual sales meeting, where I met with colleagues from around the world to discuss best practices, current trends and especially how our customers view our offerings. I heard firsthand how customers were looking at FICO to help solve their most difficult decisions and how those customers were increasingly finding new ways to use the FICO platform throughout their businesses. I don't think there's ever been a time at FICO where the team has been so excited about the opportunities ahead of us. And I share that excitement. I came away with a renewed appreciation for our unique technological capabilities and the incredible team that we have taking it to the market. Finally, as I've often said, we are committed to becoming the preeminent platform player in decisioning analytics. The strategic focus has allowed us to exit some non-strategic products and services over the last few years. In November, we announced we had reached an agreement to transition our Siron compliance business to our partner, IMTF. We closed that transaction in December. While we are proud of the work and the innovation at the FICO team put into Siron to make it an industry-leading solution, we believe we are better positioned if we dedicate our focus and our resources to expanding the capabilities and market penetration of FICO platform. I'll have some final comments in a few minutes, but first, let me turn the call back to Steve for more financial detail. Thanks. Thanks, Steve. I'm really pleased with our Q1 results. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on strategic initiatives, and I'm pleased with our positioning for the balance of fiscal 2023. Our Scores business continues to deliver growth even in a turbulent market. As I said in the past, our diversification across different credit verticals means that we are not dependent on one specific type of lending. On the software side, our platform strategy continued to drive strong results. The strategic mission-critical nature of our decisioning FICO platform means that customers are not delaying purchases and implementations. This is evident in the 13 straight quarters of 40-plus percent of platform ARR growth and the continued strong net retention rate of current customers. We are confident we have the best-in-class capabilities in an emerging marketplace that's poised for sustained growth. I'm confident we have the correct strategy and a strong team in place to deliver on the remarkable opportunities ahead. As always, we remain focused on execution, and we are committed to delivering outstanding value for our shareholders. As a reminder, when we announced our CFO transition, we also reiterated our guidance with an adjustment for the transition of the Siron Compliance Solution to our partner. So we are guiding revenues of $1.463 billion, GAAP net income of $401 million, GAAP EPS of $16, non-GAAP net income of $487 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $19.42. I'll turn the call back to Steve, and we'll be taking questions. I think the assumption still holds. The future remains uncertain, but right now, the assumption holds. We think we're right on track. So as I mentioned, I think that because the platform software is so mission-critical, it's a little bit less subject to our customers pulling in their budgets and pulling in their spend. So there's no question that there is budget pressure out there. I mean everyone is under budget pressure. But the kinds of solutions we provide with the platform are such a perfect fit for the strategic needs of some of these customers that it's something that just can't wait. And so when the customers adopt a platform, it's a transformation of their business really, and it's not the kind of thing that's easy to put off. The other thing I would say is we're demonstrating incredibly rapid return on investment. And we have testimonials from customers with amazing returns, within year returns. And that word is getting around. Our customers are finding out that this stuff pays for itself within a year. And as a result, we have not seen any slowdown in the spend on our platform business. I would say that the license deal that we referenced is kind of par for the course. We get these deals from time to time, renewal deals, sometimes they're bigger renewal deals. They happen every year. We can't really predict what quarter they happen in, and so we get a little bit of lumpiness there, and that's what we've got here. We're still in love with our stock, and the plan is to continue to return capital to shareholders through stock repurchase. That said, we'll keep an eye on rates. And we're at a weighted 4.9% on the interest expense right now. And I just \u2013 when I look at FICO stock, when you look at FICO stock, I think you believe that's a better \u2013 that's a good balance. So for now, still on stock buyback. Look, I think Steve said it well. I mean, we try to return free cash flow every year. And then periodically, we do more than that. So for the last two years, we've done considerably more than that. And it's because the stock price was depressed, like really, in our minds, quite depressed relative to its value, and also it was a lower interest rate environment. Now we have higher interest rate environment. The stock is a little bit price here. I still think it's a bargain, but it's more expensive than it was. And so we're back to thinking about stock repurchase in terms of our free cash flow, our annual free cash flow. So I would say that things have changed. I mean we were really piling up the debt to buy in the shares over the last two years, and we will not be quite as aggressive in the future, at least right now under these circumstances. We never confirmed that number. It's \u2013 and so I won't be doing it today. There is still some special pricing, but I can't confirm a number for you today. I would say yes and no. So yes, our platform growth rate is substantially higher than the Siron business that we divested. And so divesting it does contribute to a higher growth rate for FICO. And are there other opportunities in our portfolio? Not really. I mean never say never. We're always looking to be as streamlined and efficient as we possibly can be. But we're pretty happy with the set of assets and the set of solutions that we have today. Even our older application solutions are still quite popular with our customers. We continue to invest in them and make sure that they have the features and functionality that the market needs. And as you know, the renewals on these typically have a cycle of kind of three years, and they get renewed multiple times. It could be a nine-year or 12-year kind of arrangement. And so I think we'll be probably hanging on to the vast majority of our portfolio. There are no obvious candidates for divestiture at this time. Well, I can share you that our talented management team is doing everything they can on the marketing side and the customer acquisition side to keep the business growing as much as possible. But you do have a macro environment that just results in the kind of performance that you're seeing right now. That business is completely data-driven science-based kind of a business where we spend on customer acquisition up to where it ceased to be economically smart to do so. And so there's \u2013 that is always optimized. That business is optimized at whatever levels we have in the marketplace. And so the short answer to your question is we're doing just the right amount. I really think it's optimized. I don't know that more would make things better. You might be able to get the growth rate up, but it wouldn't be better from an economic standpoint. I think someday we will have declines, but I think for the time being, flat is the right way to think about it. Now obviously, we can manage that number. We choose to end of life some products, and that contributes to shrinkage. And it's a balancing. And it's really a balancing act that we are in. I think that we're in a good place right now at flat. That's just about the right balance where we can close down, end of life the products that would result in us having a lot of technical debt where we did continue them without really shrinking that business. The day will come, no doubt, when we will shrink that business somewhat. But that day is still a ways away."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Dave Singleton. Please go ahead.\nDave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most appropriate comparable GAAP measure. This includes an FY '25 guidance reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings, which are adjusted for items such as stock-based compensation and excess tax benefit. This reconciliation is part of the earnings release included an Exhibit 99.1 to our 8-K, which we filed with the SEC under Item 2.02 titled Results of Operations and Financials. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov, and a replay of this webcast will be available through November 6, 2025. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some financial highlights slides. We'll be referencing those during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our guidance for fiscal '25. We had another fantastic year. We exceeded fiscal '24 guidance on all metrics and delivered strong growth in free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the fourth quarter financial highlights, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $454 million, up 16% over last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $1.718 billion in revenue, up 13% versus the prior year. We reported $136 million in GAAP net income in the quarter, up 34% and GAAP earnings of $5.44 per share, up 36% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $513 million in GAAP net income, equating to $20.45 of earnings per share, up 19% and 21%, respectively. We reported $163 million in non-GAAP net income in the quarter, up 29% and non-GAAP earnings of $6.54 per share, up 30% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $595 million in non-GAAP net income, which equates to $23.74 of earnings per share, up 19% and 20%, respectively. As shown on Page 10, we delivered record free cash flow of $219 million in our fourth quarter and $607 million over the last four quarters, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 188,000 shares at an average price of $1,721 per share. For the fiscal year, we've repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share. In our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our fourth quarter revenues were $249 million, up 27% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $920 million, up 19% versus last year. On the B2B side, fourth quarter revenues were up 38% versus the prior year and up 27% for the full year, primarily driven by mortgage originations. On the B2C side, fourth quarter revenues were down 1% versus the prior year and down 2% for the full fiscal year, driven by decreased sales on the myfico.com website. Fourth quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 95% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 47% of B2B revenue and 37% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 2%, while credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were down 5% versus the prior year. Today, we've announced that for calendar 2025, FICO's wholesale royalty will be $4.95 per score for mortgage originations. At this new per score royalty, the amount collected by FICO will remain a small percentage, on average, about 15% of the Tri-Merge bundle cost, which typically runs $80 to well over $100. With total average closing costs of $6,000, FICO's share is only about two-tenth of 1%. As such, it will continue to be the lowest of all individual mortgage closing costs. The FICO Score plays a central role in facilitating about $2 trillion in mortgage originations every year as a critical tool for borrowers, lenders, insurers, investors and other important stakeholders. The royalty collected by FICO is entirely fair and reasonable, and the FICO score continues to deliver incredible value as the most trusted and cost-effective tool used to evaluate consumer credit risk and residential mortgage finance. More information on our new royalty pricing can be found on our website at www.fico.com/blogs, and I would encourage you all to get some more detail on the blog. We continue to drive strong adoption from FICO Score 10 T for the non-GSE mortgages. This quarter, we signed new lenders, including United Wholesale Mortgages, the largest global mortgage lender. We now have clients with over $244 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $1.33 trillion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing that have signed up for FICO Score 10 T. Firms are already using 10 T to make credit decisions, for securitization and for delivery to investors. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages sold in the GSEs will be rolled out based on the timeline of the FAA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. Now we continue to innovate in our Scores business. Last week, we announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator, which enables mortgage professionals to run credit event scenarios by applying simulated changes in an applicant's credit report data to simulate potential changes to the applicant FICO score. This benefits both mortgage lenders and consumers by potentially providing more loan options and more favorable interest rates. In our Software segment, we delivered $205 million in fourth quarter revenue, up 5% from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We delivered $798 million in fiscal year revenue, up 8% from last year. We continued to drive growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, the total ARR was up 8%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR flat year-over-year. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 106% with platform NRR at 123% and non-platform at 99%. ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $85 million, down 10% year-over-year. While we face some macroeconomic headwinds in the first half of the year, the second half bookings were consistent year-over-year. I am excited about the future of our software business. This quarter, IDC recognized FICO as a leader in the worldwide Decision Intelligence platform market. This is a testament to our commitment to innovation that enables real-time transparent decision-making at scale. We help organizations design, engineer and orchestrate decisions by automating steps in the decision-making process. FICO was recognized for its capabilities and strategy meeting both today's customers' needs and the needs of our customers in the future. We announced two FICO platform partnerships this quarter. We have partnered with Tata Consulting Services, generally known as TCS, a global services integrator and with iSON Xperiences the largest business process outsourcing solutions company in Africa. Both partnerships will leverage FICO platform to create industry-specific solutions for real-time decision making. These partnerships will help us continue to drive strong growth for our platform business. Before I address fiscal '25 guidance, I'll pass it over to Steve to provide some other financial details.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $454 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.718 billion was up 13% over last year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $249 million, up 27% from the prior year. B2B revenues in that score space were up 38%, driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 1% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business. For the full year, B2B revenues were $712 million, up 27% and B2C revenues were $208 million, down 2%. Total Scores revenues were $920 million, up 19% despite headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues for the quarter were $205 million, up 5% from the prior year. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. Full year software revenues were $798 million, up 8% from the prior previous year. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region delivered 5%. Our total software ARR was $720 million -- $721 million, an 8% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $227 million, representing 31% of our total Q4 '24 ARR, up from 26% of total Q4 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non-platform was flat at $494 million this quarter. This aligns with our strategy to focus on FICO platform growth while continuing to retain our non-platform customers. Over time, we do expect migration of these customers to platform products. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106%. Platform NRR was 123%, while our non-platform NRR was 99%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage of existing use cases. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. ACV bookings for the full year were $85 million. Turning now to expenses for the quarter, as shown on Page 5 of the financial highlights presentation. Our total operating expenses were $257 million this quarter versus $224 million in the prior year, an increase of 15% year-over-year and flat versus the prior quarter. For the full year, our expenses were $984 million versus $871 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. Our FY '25 guidance assumes lower year-over-year expense growth than in the prior year. We maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. We continue to focus investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO platform, while also investing in Scores resources and marketing. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 52% for the quarter compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 90 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $136 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $163 million for the quarter, up 29% from the prior year's quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $513 million, up 19% versus last year, and non-GAAP net income was $595 million, up 19% versus last year. GAAP earnings per share this quarter were $5.44, up 36% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.54, up 30% from the prior year. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share were $20.45, up 21% from last year, and our non-GAAP earnings per share were $23.74, up 20% from last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%. The effective tax rate for the full year was 20.1%, which included $30 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We believe that our fiscal year 2025 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, a 35% increase from the previous year. The full year free cash flow was $607 million and was up 31% versus last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $196 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.21 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 59% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 188,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $1,721 per share. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. In fiscal 2024, we repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share for a total of $828 million. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will to review our fiscal 2025 guidance.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve. We continue to execute on our strategy, the proof is in our financial results and customer adoption of both our software and Scores products. Fiscal '24 was a great year. We had our most successful FICO World as we brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe. We continue to win the trust of our customers with over 100 customers speaking on stage as to how our software helps achieve their goals. We continue to be an industry leader as evidenced by analyst community reports, including IDC, Forrester, Gartner and Chartis. We continue to innovate. At FICO World, we introduced APIs to drive partner channel adoption of FICO Platform. We previewed the upcoming launch of our new FICO Marketplace. In year, we delivered new FICO Platform capabilities, created new IP using responsible AI methods and announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator. We continued our commitment to financial literacy for both students and adults. We completed the field of dreams, the field of financial empowerment summer tour with Chelsea Football Club and U.S. Soccer Foundation. We hosted Score A Better Future workshops across the U.S., which is just one of FICO's programs that help millions of people gain access to credit. We're well positioned for strong fiscal '25. As we announce our guidance, I'll remind everyone that consistent with prior years, we expect some of the pricing initiatives in 2015 have an additional impact beyond our guidance numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact. While macro trends are difficult to predict, our recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2025. With that in mind, we are guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings metrics as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.98 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase. GAAP net income of about $624 million, an increase of 22%, GAAP EPS of about $25.05, an increase of 23%, non-GAAP net income of approximately $712 million, an increase of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $28.58, an increase of 20%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session.\nDave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Your question please, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening. Well, thank you for the disclosure and pointing us to the blog as well. I think the whole 0.2% that you've talked about, that's been pretty consistent. I guess just thinking ahead, do you still see more room for that gap to close? I mean, I guess it's 1% the mark?\nWill Lansing: Well, we continue to believe that our score delivers tremendous value relative to what we charge. And so yes, I would say that there is still opportunity.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. Good enough. And then, well, I guess, the -- where there's obviously a lot of work and focus on your end is on the software side. And I was just wondering if you could just level set us with, I don't know how you want to think about it, whether what inning you're in and what some of the key initiatives you have planned for this year is on that software side, whether it's maybe more spending to keep investing in the platform? Or just anything there would be helpful.\nWill Lansing: I would say that we're still very much in early innings. You can see that with our penetration of what we call enterprise platform customers, EPCs, where we've penetrated a little under half of the top 300 financial institutions globally. So there's still a lot of opportunity for landing the platform with major players with major lending institutions. And that, of course, is before we go down market, that's before we expand through to other verticals. So I'd say it's very, very early innings. That said, we're so far beyond minimum viable products that we're not in inning one. We are along -- far enough along that we have the preeminent platform in the world for decisioning and it is increasingly recognized by players who need it. So that continues to be something really strong for us. I think in terms of investment and when do margins expand, we will continue to invest in the platform. There's certainly a lot more features and functionality that our customers are clamoring for. And as we've discussed in the past, we are investing in indirect sales and distribution. We are investing in an ecosystem that with our open APIs should enable all kinds of players that we don't ordinarily do business with to take advantage of our decisioning IP. So there is this pretty big opportunity still ahead of us, and it does demand some level of investment. All that said, we are in the process of reengineering our platforms for scalability and for margins. And there's no doubt that even if we maintain high R&D spend, which we do today and which will likely continue for some time, our margins ought to improve over time just because we're getting more scale and because we've designed with a view to improving margins through more scale. So I hope that's helpful. Early days, continued investments, but we're going to get more profitable anyway.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you, Will.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind of Jefferies. Please go ahead, Surinder.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. Well, just on the software piece, can you maybe just disaggregate the overall guidance, what your expectations are for the software component and how we should think about maybe platform versus non- platform at this point?\nSteveWeber: Yes, thanks for the question, Surinder. We don't guide at that level. We don't guide at the segment level. We just got the total corporate level. So we don't talk about specifics what we expect in Scores versus software and even below that on the software side, we're not -- we don't split out platform versus non-platform. Frankly, it's a little difficult sometimes to even know the difference between platform and non-platform, when we\u2019re early stage with some of these deals that could end up on the platform or could end up in the legacy product as well. So we don't really split that out.\nSurinder Thind: Understood. And then in terms of just when I think about the, what I would call the partnerships that you're putting into place, in the process of them trying to build out industry solutions. Any color there you can provide on what specific solutions they may be looking at or what industries they might be looking at, at this point? And then how does that work in terms of the IP sharing that such a relationship might have?\nWill Lansing: Sure. It's a good question. I mean, as all of you know, partnerships work best when there's enough economics in it for both sides and where the relationship is complementary and that partners are not competing for the same thing. And so in our partnership with TCS, for example, which is a very strong partnership. We have a number of things going on here. We have tremendous decisioning IP. They have tremendous reach and distribution and professional services and participation in a whole lot of verticals that FICO does not participate in. So they -- we're doing two kinds of things with them. One is they're developing a level of expertise and confidence for implementing our solutions so that it can help our direct customers with implementation because they favor professional services in a way that we do not. And so there's a benefit there. But they're also very interested in providing solutions to their customers, vertical by vertical and leveraging IP. And I think they recognize that our decisioning IP is pretty special. And so they're building solutions around our IP for particular verticals where they have a presence and some expertise. So for example, in the logistics area, TCS is building a proprietary solution based on our decisioning IP. But our intent is to do that and replicate that in other verticals as well.\nSurinder Thind: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, that's it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. You're planning to raise mortgage prices by approximately 50% in 2025. Can you discuss how you're thinking about prices for non-mortgage scores in 2025?\nWill Lansing: Yes. So first of all, I guess I would point out that at $4.95, that's not a 50% increase, it's less than a 50% increase. But in terms of the other scores prices, as you know, we review the entire portfolio every year and we think about where it's appropriate and fair to raise prices, and we don't do the same thing in every pocket of scores demand. It varies, it varies by year, it varies by segment. And we did apply some increases to non-mortgage. Of course, mortgage isn't the entire business by any means.\nGeorge Tong: Okay. Got it. And then broadly, can you talk about how you expect the Trump presidency to impact FICO's operations?\nWill Lansing: Yes. That's an obvious kind of a question. And as you can imagine, we think a lot about it. That said, I would just say that we work with both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we've had good success with both and the reason is that we're such a core component of the markets in which we operate, we're so integral to the system that it's really unlikely that Republican or Democratic administrations will do things that the push FICO out of its position in the system. We anticipate that in Trump administration, we'll continue to operate as we have is the cornerstone of the credit lending market in the U.S. And so we look forward to that.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi. Thank you so much. So Will you alluded to some macro uncertainty? And I'm curious if you could elaborate on that? Like are you expecting mortgage volumes to recover in 2025. We are seeing rates a little bit higher. And I'm curious if you can comment on like number of pools that you were seeing per application because there are some indications that those have been declining more recently.\nWill Lansing: Well, so with respect to macroeconomic uncertainty, I think that nobody knows what the future holds, not us and not you -- and so we leave it to you to come up with your own estimates on where you think mortgage volumes will be over the coming year. We do anticipate mortgage volumes will increase in the future. But the schedule for that is a little hard to say. And so we've incorporated in our guidance as is typical for us an appropriate level of conservatism. And we'll just have to see how things pan out. In terms of number of pools, we don't really -- we don't have a public pronouncement on that.\nFaiza Alwy: Okay. Understood. And then I noticed you've been talking about the value that the FICO score provides to secondary market participants, and I'm curious if you have been thinking about that as a potential revenue opportunity going forward? Do you think there's something there?\nWill Lansing: You know that is a very interesting question. There's no doubt that many people who use the FICO Score don't pay for it. Many people use and rely on the FICO Score. Our business model today has historically been built around -- we charge for the first use and then the downstream and subsequent uses when they are permitted by us by contract, tend to be free. Of course, we're in business. And so we think about every kind of variation on a theme, and we thought about trying to put the pricing where the usage is to make sure that you could lower prices in one place and raise them somewhere else, maybe that's more fair. But we also recognize that the system is what it is, and every change has to be scrutinized from the standpoint of what kind of unforeseen consequences and what kind of difficulties might we encounter if we change the system. So it's easy for our strategic thinkers inside FICO to come up with dozens and dozens of variations on how we might price our IP. And trust me, we do. We think about those things, but we're also really mindful of the kind of responsibility that we have to the economy to the community, to our customers, to the participants in the ecosystem and we are loath to make changes that could rattle markets. We don't want to do that. So we're very, very cautious and careful about everything we do. And you've seen that, but that's not to say we don't study it. And if appropriate, we might consider something like that in the future.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Owen.\nOwen Lau: Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. And going back to your guidance, could you please maybe add more color on how do you assume how many weight cuts you expect in 2025? And how will that impact the loan volume. Thanks.\nWill Lansing: You know that's one of those areas where everybody has a different opinion and we don't publish our opinion. I think you know what our pricing is. And so I think you should apply that to your own best estimates as a guide to making your decisions about what the future holds for us. I don't know that my speculating on how many rate cut is going to be helpful to anyone. I'm not sure that my opinion is worth more than anyone else's.\nOwen Lau: Got it. And then on the platform side, some of the analytic firms were under pressure because of the end market challenges and budget cuts and vendor consolidation and things like that. Could you please give us an update on what you're hearing from your clients given that we are going to the year-end budgeting period. Thanks.\nWill Lansing: Yes, absolutely. What you point out is something that we used to experience a lot in our applications business five and 10 years ago, where we were very much under budget pressure. And so when our customers were under a lot of budget pressure, the sales cycle stretched out and decisions were postponed and deals were postponed. We see much less of that now. What we see is that the platform is truly a strategic investment by our customers. It tends to be decided at the C-suite level and so I won't say that we're immune to budgetary pressures. But I think that there is this imperative for our customers to make a transition to digital relationships with their consumer customers and they want the kind of power that our platform brings. And their choice is really to try to build it themselves some kind of homegrown solution or to buy it from FICO because there's really not any meaningful competition in terms of features and functionality with our platform. And as between building it in-house and buying the FICO solution, we've invested close to $1 billion in our software business to get to this point. And there are a few customers with the wherewithal to make those kinds of investments. And so any kind of a homegrown solution is just not going to be competitive with what they -- FICO at a fraction of the cost. And so what we see is tremendous adoption of our platform because they do the analysis, and it's a very cost-effective solution, and they get more functionality than they were planning on. They get it much faster than they could if they did it themselves. And so that's really kind of how that decision is going down. So budgetary pressure, who knows, with less budgetary pressure, maybe we'd be doing even better than we are, we can't really say. But we are not experiencing a lot of slowdown because of budget pressures.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson of Needham & Company. Your question please, Kyle.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start off on the Scores revenue this quarter came in really strong. Just wanted to see where there any one-timers. I know in the past, sometimes, you guys have had some licensing deals or royalty true-up. So I just want to see like, is that a clean number? Or was there anything onetime in the 4Q number?\nSteveWeber: Yes, there were -- there was a little bit of onetime and there's off, I mean, as you know, most quarters, there's some. There was probably a little bit more than -- certainly than last quarter than this quarter. So there's a few million dollars of additional revenue there. I mean it's nothing all that material in the overall number, but there definitely was a little bit of onetime revenue that we don't necessarily have in our run rate.\nKyle Peterson: Okay. That's helpful, thank you. And then I guess just a follow-up on the mortgage score price rollout. I appreciate the transparency there. Should we think of this as being fully phased in on January 1? Or is there kind of a scheduled phasing or any lag time that we should be mindful of?\nSteveWeber: Yes, there's always a lag. It's not scheduled, but there's -- we used to always talk about discord being feathered in, right, the price because some customers are on deals that don't lap on January 1, still might lap later. But -- so it's consistent with every other year we've had essentially.\nKyle Peterson: Okay, thank you. Nice quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Haas of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Jason.\nJason Haas: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious if you could talk about what sort of analysis you did to arrive at the $4.95 mortgage score price? Like why did you decide that was the right number to go with? And then I'm also curious, recognize you're not going to go through the details of the pricing for auto and card, but if you could also talk about what sort of analysis you've run to determine what would be the appropriate price for those verticals as well. Thanks.\nWill Lansing: There are a lot of factors that go into it. There's not a formula. It's not formulaic, but we look at everything. We do look at volumes. We look at the market. We think a lot about whether the price is fair, whether we're asking our customers to pay a price that exceeds the value that we provide. And we think a lot about those things. And you can probably imagine my view on this, which is that we think it's tremendous value. And so we're fine with where we are. Every year is different. The percentage increases each year are different. The dollar amount increases are different each year. There's not a formula for it. And we sit down in the couple of months before the September 1 rate card gets published to our partners and we think about it. We also have discussions with them. So there's just a lot of factors that go into it.\nJason Haas: Got it, thank you. That's helpful. And then if I could ask a follow-up. On the non-platform business declined slightly, which is a little off trend. I know it's not the focus to grow that, but I was curious if there was anything in particular we should be aware for the quarter there?\nWill Lansing: No. There's nothing -- there's nothing there. It's based on volumes. I mean some volumes get a little bit more, a little bit less. It's just volumes and amounted usage we had this quarter.\nJason Haas: That makes sense, thank you.\nWill Lansing: It's worth pointing out. I mean, how do we think about that business -- we have this very strong legacy business where we have large market share in a half dozen very important applications for our customers. They typically renew on like a three-year renewal cycle, that's not -- it varies, but it happens often. And we're not in a big hurry to push them to the platform. We have our hands full with new business on the platform. And so as long as we have customers who are happy to renew the legacy products, we're happy with that. And we continue to invest in those legacy products to make sure that the features and functionality are appropriate for today and for tomorrow and for the future. So I think our legacy business is going to be healthy for a very long time to come. We're not really pushing to grow it quickly. And we're also -- we're not in a harvest mode either. We make modest investment to keep it current. And the fluctuation, whether it's a little over 100% or a little below 100% in terms of where we stand. That tends to be volume driven. It tends to be usage by our customers that pushes us there.\nJason Haas: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra of RBC Capital Markets. Your question please, Ashish.\nDavid Paige: Hi, this is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on the good results. Two questions. I was wondering if you could talk about the -- if any, competitive dynamics in auto and in card. And then as a follow-up, just a higher level of thinking of what your capital allocation priorities are going to be in 2025. Thank you.\nWill Lansing: Okay. So with respect to auto and card, those two businesses look today like they did a year ago and like they did 2 years ago, very little change competitively. Our customers continue to use our products and just not a lot of change there, not a lot of competitive threat, not a lot of new innovation coming from competitors. So really kind of no change there. With respect to capital allocation, our strategy there remains unchanged. As you know, we strive to return capital to our shareholders. We have a very efficient business model. We try to run a pretty efficient balance sheet. We try to manage our leverage to between two and three times and have some level of efficiency there. And it is remarkable to say with a PE north of 100 that we still think our stock is a screaming value, but we really do believe that. And I have -- I've been doing these calls now for 13 years, and every single call, it seems like our stock is at an all-time high, and people wonder why are you still buying back your stock? And to date, it's been a pretty good call. We expect that to continue. We have every intention of returning free cash flow and then some to our shareholders through stock buyback.\nDavid Paige: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch of Redburn Atlantic. Your question please, Simon.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, well, perhaps you could -- it's quite an important day to be issuing your earnings in the U.S. And I was wondering if you could give some thoughts around really around the FHFA's proposal and implementation of this proposal in the fourth quarter. Do you think anything really changes in terms of the probabilities of that being either delayed or canceled or any thoughts around that would be very useful. Thank you.\nWill Lansing: We wonder the same thing, and I think no one knows I don't think it's a secret that the industry has been slow to move on the expected implementation because there are some things that still have to be sorted out. The FHFA has a plan. We're working with them, cooperating with them every way we can to see it happen. But there's no telling what a new administration might do. They -- it's just really hard to say. Maybe things take a little bit longer than they otherwise might have. That's probably the most likely scenario. But there could be a change in direction, one just doesn't know.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. That's useful, thanks. And just as a follow-up then, just on the software business, could you provide a little bit more color just around sort of where you are in terms of exploring the investments behind expanding your distribution beyond just your financial -- large financial customers and just where you are with that, please? Thanks.\nWill Lansing: Yes. There's a few ways we're going at that. I mean, at the upper end of the ecosystem, we're working with partners. So I mentioned TCS was one, but we're in conversations with a number and have deals with a number of other partners. So the big systems integrators, they are very natural partners for us to get into other verticals. And they have customers, they have distribution, they have skills, they have domain expertise and they can take that, apply it to our IP and provide solutions in these other verticals. And so that's clearly a very efficient way for us to get into kind of more diversified markets. The other thing that we're focused on, which I think is going to take longer is, I wouldn't call it quite a self-service model, but more a self-service model where we have open APIs and ISVs and resellers and VARs have the opportunity to come and leverage our platform and our IP with very little intervention from us. And in the long run, we'd really like to see that flourish. We have a marketplace that we've built to facilitate this. But I think that's going to take time to build.\nSimon Clinch: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research. Your question please, Scott.\nScott Wurtzel: Thanks, good afternoon, guys. Just first one on the ACV bookings trends. I know historically, we usually see a sequential step-up from 3Q to 4Q. And I thought the number was still pretty good. But just wondering, was there any maybe pull forward of bookings into the third quarter that is maybe distorting that seasonal trend a little bit?\nSteveWeber: Yes. I mean there's really no reason for a seasonal trend. Typically, a lot of times it does happen that our fourth quarter is higher. But if you look at this year, our third and fourth quarter was exactly the same number, give or take, as the third and fourth quarter combined last year. So there probably was some pull forward on some deals from our fourth quarter this year into the third quarter. And there have been some deals last year that pushed from the third and fourth quarter. So it's hard to really look at any one specific quarter that way.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just on your guidance, wondering if you can maybe help us understand how you're thinking about investments and expense growth in fiscal year '25. Thanks.\nSteveWeber: Yes. When you see it built into -- if you -- we gave you all the numbers basically, you kind of see what our expense elevate looks like. But as we said, the expense growth that's built into the guidance is a lower growth rate than what we saw in '24. We have some kind of onetime things happening in '24, both non-repeating some benefits we got last year and then some onetime as we paid for this year as well. So there's some growth built into the expenses, but it's less than what we had this year. And then it's less than what our top line revenue growth. So we'll get margin expansion out of that. And then if we -- if we're able to beat guidance throughout the year, usually that comes along in a pretty decent margin. So there's a little bit of expense growth that comes with additional revenue, but that would come at a much higher margin profile as well.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Stein of FT Partners. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Stein: Hi, thank you. I just have one question tonight. Could you at least provide some color on the volume trends within scores when the 30-year mortgage was closer to 6% in the back half of September relative to the rest of the quarter? Thanks.\nSteveWeber: Yes. I mean the best source for data for that is actually just look at what the NBA publishes. That's what we look at. That's actually more realtime than the numbers that we see. So we can't really track it on a week-by-week basis like they do. So I would push you to that, first of all. But we did see -- we saw some upticks when the rate came down and then we saw it slow down a little bit. And it's hard to really draw much of a trend from any of that. So we're -- obviously, we're very conservative with the way we guide going forward.\nAndrew Stein: Got it, appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVay of UBS. Please go ahead, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you so much. Could you give us a sense of with the 2025 pricing, how much of that is factored into the guidance already just directionally? And is there anything from '24 that's factored into the '25 guidance? I guess, any sense of just how that phases, maybe anything that didn't occur in '24 in the '25 and '25 more broadly?\nWill Lansing: Yes. I think that the two things going on there. One is the new pricing each year goes into effect on Jan 1, but our fiscal runs from October 1 to September 30. So obviously, there's a 1-quarter discrepancy in the pricing -- and when the pricing gets, so that's one factor that influences it. And then the other, as Steve mentioned earlier, is a lot of our channel partner customers have multiyear deals. And so -- and when they do, we honor the prices from prior years. And so that's another thing that can affect that relationship.\nKevin McVeigh: Very helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Q&A portion of our call and our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steve Weber",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $454 million, an increase of 16% over the prior year. Our full year revenue of $1.718 billion was up 13% over last year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $249 million, up 27% from the prior year. B2B revenues in that score space were up 38%, driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 1% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business. For the full year, B2B revenues were $712 million, up 27% and B2C revenues were $208 million, down 2%. Total Scores revenues were $920 million, up 19% despite headwinds in the mortgage originations market. Software segment revenues for the quarter were $205 million, up 5% from the prior year. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. Full year software revenues were $798 million, up 8% from the prior previous year. This quarter, 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region delivered 5%. Our total software ARR was $720 million -- $721 million, an 8% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $227 million, representing 31% of our total Q4 '24 ARR, up from 26% of total Q4 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non-platform was flat at $494 million this quarter. This aligns with our strategy to focus on FICO platform growth while continuing to retain our non-platform customers. Over time, we do expect migration of these customers to platform products. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 106%. Platform NRR was 123%, while our non-platform NRR was 99%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage of existing use cases. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. ACV bookings for the full year were $85 million. Turning now to expenses for the quarter, as shown on Page 5 of the financial highlights presentation. Our total operating expenses were $257 million this quarter versus $224 million in the prior year, an increase of 15% year-over-year and flat versus the prior quarter. For the full year, our expenses were $984 million versus $871 million in the prior year, an increase of 13%. Our FY '25 guidance assumes lower year-over-year expense growth than in the prior year. We maintain our focus on efficiencies and are committed to prioritizing resources to our most strategic initiatives. We continue to focus investment to accelerate development and distribution of FICO platform, while also investing in Scores resources and marketing. Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 52% for the quarter compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. We delivered non-GAAP margin expansion of 90 basis points for the full fiscal year. GAAP net income this quarter was $136 million, up 34% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $163 million for the quarter, up 29% from the prior year's quarter. For the full year, GAAP net income was $513 million, up 19% versus last year, and non-GAAP net income was $595 million, up 19% versus last year. GAAP earnings per share this quarter were $5.44, up 36% from the prior year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $6.54, up 30% from the prior year. For the full year, GAAP earnings per share were $20.45, up 21% from last year, and our non-GAAP earnings per share were $23.74, up 20% from last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.8%. The effective tax rate for the full year was 20.1%, which included $30 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. We believe that our fiscal year 2025 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $219 million, a 35% increase from the previous year. The full year free cash flow was $607 million and was up 31% versus last year. At the end of the quarter, we had $196 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.21 billion, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 59% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 188,000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of $1,721 per share. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. In fiscal 2024, we repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share for a total of $828 million. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will to review our fiscal 2025 guidance. Yes, thanks for the question, Surinder. We don't guide at that level. We don't guide at the segment level. We just got the total corporate level. So we don't talk about specifics what we expect in Scores versus software and even below that on the software side, we're not -- we don't split out platform versus non-platform. Frankly, it's a little difficult sometimes to even know the difference between platform and non-platform, when we're early stage with some of these deals that could end up on the platform or could end up in the legacy product as well. So we don't really split that out. Yes, there were -- there was a little bit of onetime and there's off, I mean, as you know, most quarters, there's some. There was probably a little bit more than -- certainly than last quarter than this quarter. So there's a few million dollars of additional revenue there. I mean it's nothing all that material in the overall number, but there definitely was a little bit of onetime revenue that we don't necessarily have in our run rate. Yes, there's always a lag. It's not scheduled, but there's -- we used to always talk about discord being feathered in, right, the price because some customers are on deals that don't lap on January 1, still might lap later. But -- so it's consistent with every other year we've had essentially. Yes. I mean there's really no reason for a seasonal trend. Typically, a lot of times it does happen that our fourth quarter is higher. But if you look at this year, our third and fourth quarter was exactly the same number, give or take, as the third and fourth quarter combined last year. So there probably was some pull forward on some deals from our fourth quarter this year into the third quarter. And there have been some deals last year that pushed from the third and fourth quarter. So it's hard to really look at any one specific quarter that way. Yes.

And then if we -- if we're able to beat guidance throughout the year, usually that comes along in a pretty decent margin. So there's a little bit of expense growth that comes with additional revenue, but that would come at a much higher margin profile as well. Yes.

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our fourth quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we've posted some financial highlights slides. We'll be referencing those during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our guidance for fiscal '25. We had another fantastic year. We exceeded fiscal '24 guidance on all metrics and delivered strong growth in free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the fourth quarter financial highlights, we reported fourth quarter revenues of $454 million, up 16% over last year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $1.718 billion in revenue, up 13% versus the prior year. We reported $136 million in GAAP net income in the quarter, up 34% and GAAP earnings of $5.44 per share, up 36% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $513 million in GAAP net income, equating to $20.45 of earnings per share, up 19% and 21%, respectively. We reported $163 million in non-GAAP net income in the quarter, up 29% and non-GAAP earnings of $6.54 per share, up 30% from the prior year. For the full fiscal year, we delivered $595 million in non-GAAP net income, which equates to $23.74 of earnings per share, up 19% and 20%, respectively. As shown on Page 10, we delivered record free cash flow of $219 million in our fourth quarter and $607 million over the last four quarters, an increase of 31% year-over-year. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 188,000 shares at an average price of $1,721 per share. For the fiscal year, we've repurchased 606,000 shares at an average price of $1,366 per share. In our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our fourth quarter revenues were $249 million, up 27% versus the prior year. For the full year, our revenues were $920 million, up 19% versus last year. On the B2B side, fourth quarter revenues were up 38% versus the prior year and up 27% for the full year, primarily driven by mortgage originations. On the B2C side, fourth quarter revenues were down 1% versus the prior year and down 2% for the full fiscal year, driven by decreased sales on the myfico.com website. Fourth quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 95% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 47% of B2B revenue and 37% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 2%, while credit card, personal loan and other origination revenues were down 5% versus the prior year. Today, we've announced that for calendar 2025, FICO's wholesale royalty will be $4.95 per score for mortgage originations. At this new per score royalty, the amount collected by FICO will remain a small percentage, on average, about 15% of the Tri-Merge bundle cost, which typically runs $80 to well over $100. With total average closing costs of $6,000, FICO's share is only about two-tenth of 1%. As such, it will continue to be the lowest of all individual mortgage closing costs. The FICO Score plays a central role in facilitating about $2 trillion in mortgage originations every year as a critical tool for borrowers, lenders, insurers, investors and other important stakeholders. The royalty collected by FICO is entirely fair and reasonable, and the FICO score continues to deliver incredible value as the most trusted and cost-effective tool used to evaluate consumer credit risk and residential mortgage finance. More information on our new royalty pricing can be found on our website at www.fico.com/blogs, and I would encourage you all to get some more detail on the blog. We continue to drive strong adoption from FICO Score 10 T for the non-GSE mortgages. This quarter, we signed new lenders, including United Wholesale Mortgages, the largest global mortgage lender. We now have clients with over $244 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $1.33 trillion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing that have signed up for FICO Score 10 T. Firms are already using 10 T to make credit decisions, for securitization and for delivery to investors. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages sold in the GSEs will be rolled out based on the timeline of the FAA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. Now we continue to innovate in our Scores business. Last week, we announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator, which enables mortgage professionals to run credit event scenarios by applying simulated changes in an applicant's credit report data to simulate potential changes to the applicant FICO score. This benefits both mortgage lenders and consumers by potentially providing more loan options and more favorable interest rates. In our Software segment, we delivered $205 million in fourth quarter revenue, up 5% from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We delivered $798 million in fiscal year revenue, up 8% from last year. We continued to drive growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, the total ARR was up 8%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR flat year-over-year. Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 106% with platform NRR at 123% and non-platform at 99%. ACV bookings for the quarter were $22 million. Our total ACV bookings for the year were $85 million, down 10% year-over-year. While we face some macroeconomic headwinds in the first half of the year, the second half bookings were consistent year-over-year. I am excited about the future of our software business. This quarter, IDC recognized FICO as a leader in the worldwide Decision Intelligence platform market. This is a testament to our commitment to innovation that enables real-time transparent decision-making at scale. We help organizations design, engineer and orchestrate decisions by automating steps in the decision-making process. FICO was recognized for its capabilities and strategy meeting both today's customers' needs and the needs of our customers in the future. We announced two FICO platform partnerships this quarter. We have partnered with Tata Consulting Services, generally known as TCS, a global services integrator and with iSON Xperiences the largest business process outsourcing solutions company in Africa. Both partnerships will leverage FICO platform to create industry-specific solutions for real-time decision making. These partnerships will help us continue to drive strong growth for our platform business. Before I address fiscal '25 guidance, I'll pass it over to Steve to provide some other financial details. Thanks, Steve. We continue to execute on our strategy, the proof is in our financial results and customer adoption of both our software and Scores products. Fiscal '24 was a great year. We had our most successful FICO World as we brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe. We continue to win the trust of our customers with over 100 customers speaking on stage as to how our software helps achieve their goals. We continue to be an industry leader as evidenced by analyst community reports, including IDC, Forrester, Gartner and Chartis. We continue to innovate. At FICO World, we introduced APIs to drive partner channel adoption of FICO Platform. We previewed the upcoming launch of our new FICO Marketplace. In year, we delivered new FICO Platform capabilities, created new IP using responsible AI methods and announced the upcoming launch of FICO Score mortgage simulator. We continued our commitment to financial literacy for both students and adults. We completed the field of dreams, the field of financial empowerment summer tour with Chelsea Football Club and U.S. Soccer Foundation. We hosted Score A Better Future workshops across the U.S., which is just one of FICO's programs that help millions of people gain access to credit. We're well positioned for strong fiscal '25. As we announce our guidance, I'll remind everyone that consistent with prior years, we expect some of the pricing initiatives in 2015 have an additional impact beyond our guidance numbers. And because of uncertainty in volumes, it's difficult to estimate the timing and magnitude of that impact. While macro trends are difficult to predict, our recurring revenues and diversified product portfolio give us considerable visibility into fiscal 2025. With that in mind, we are guiding double-digit growth for both revenue and earnings metrics as shown on Page 13 of the presentation. We are guiding revenues of about $1.98 billion, a 15% year-over-year increase. GAAP net income of about $624 million, an increase of 22%, GAAP EPS of about $25.05, an increase of 23%, non-GAAP net income of approximately $712 million, an increase of 20% and non-GAAP EPS of approximately $28.58, an increase of 20%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session. Well, we continue to believe that our score delivers tremendous value relative to what we charge. And so yes, I would say that there is still opportunity. I would say that we're still very much in early innings. You can see that with our penetration of what we call enterprise platform customers, EPCs, where we've penetrated a little under half of the top 300 financial institutions globally. So there's still a lot of opportunity for landing the platform with major players with major lending institutions. And that, of course, is before we go down market, that's before we expand through to other verticals. So I'd say it's very, very early innings. That said, we're so far beyond minimum viable products that we're not in inning one. We are along -- far enough along that we have the preeminent platform in the world for decisioning and it is increasingly recognized by players who need it. So that continues to be something really strong for us. I think in terms of investment and when do margins expand, we will continue to invest in the platform. There's certainly a lot more features and functionality that our customers are clamoring for. And as we've discussed in the past, we are investing in indirect sales and distribution. We are investing in an ecosystem that with our open APIs should enable all kinds of players that we don't ordinarily do business with to take advantage of our decisioning IP. So there is this pretty big opportunity still ahead of us, and it does demand some level of investment. All that said, we are in the process of reengineering our platforms for scalability and for margins. And there's no doubt that even if we maintain high R&D spend, which we do today and which will likely continue for some time, our margins ought to improve over time just because we're getting more scale and because we've designed with a view to improving margins through more scale. So I hope that's helpful. Early days, continued investments, but we're going to get more profitable anyway. Sure. It's a good question. I mean, as all of you know, partnerships work best when there's enough economics in it for both sides and where the relationship is complementary and that partners are not competing for the same thing. And so in our partnership with TCS, for example, which is a very strong partnership. We have a number of things going on here. We have tremendous decisioning IP. They have tremendous reach and distribution and professional services and participation in a whole lot of verticals that FICO does not participate in. So they -- we're doing two kinds of things with them. One is they're developing a level of expertise and confidence for implementing our solutions so that it can help our direct customers with implementation because they favor professional services in a way that we do not. And so there's a benefit there. But they're also very interested in providing solutions to their customers, vertical by vertical and leveraging IP. And I think they recognize that our decisioning IP is pretty special. And so they're building solutions around our IP for particular verticals where they have a presence and some expertise. So for example, in the logistics area, TCS is building a proprietary solution based on our decisioning IP. But our intent is to do that and replicate that in other verticals as well. Yes. So first of all, I guess I would point out that at $4.95, that's not a 50% increase, it's less than a 50% increase. But in terms of the other scores prices, as you know, we review the entire portfolio every year and we think about where it's appropriate and fair to raise prices, and we don't do the same thing in every pocket of scores demand. It varies, it varies by year, it varies by segment. And we did apply some increases to non-mortgage. Of course, mortgage isn't the entire business by any means. Yes. That's an obvious kind of a question. And as you can imagine, we think a lot about it. That said, I would just say that we work with both Republican and Democratic administrations, and we've had good success with both and the reason is that we're such a core component of the markets in which we operate, we're so integral to the system that it's really unlikely that Republican or Democratic administrations will do things that the push FICO out of its position in the system. We anticipate that in Trump administration, we'll continue to operate as we have is the cornerstone of the credit lending market in the U.S. And so we look forward to that. Well, so with respect to macroeconomic uncertainty, I think that nobody knows what the future holds, not us and not you -- and so we leave it to you to come up with your own estimates on where you think mortgage volumes will be over the coming year. We do anticipate mortgage volumes will increase in the future. But the schedule for that is a little hard to say. And so we've incorporated in our guidance as is typical for us an appropriate level of conservatism. And we'll just have to see how things pan out. In terms of number of pools, we don't really -- we don't have a public pronouncement on that. You know that is a very interesting question. There's no doubt that many people who use the FICO Score don't pay for it. Many people use and rely on the FICO Score. Our business model today has historically been built around -- we charge for the first use and then the downstream and subsequent uses when they are permitted by us by contract, tend to be free. Of course, we're in business. And so we think about every kind of variation on a theme, and we thought about trying to put the pricing where the usage is to make sure that you could lower prices in one place and raise them somewhere else, maybe that's more fair. But we also recognize that the system is what it is, and every change has to be scrutinized from the standpoint of what kind of unforeseen consequences and what kind of difficulties might we encounter if we change the system. So it's easy for our strategic thinkers inside FICO to come up with dozens and dozens of variations on how we might price our IP. And trust me, we do. We think about those things, but we're also really mindful of the kind of responsibility that we have to the economy to the community, to our customers, to the participants in the ecosystem and we are loath to make changes that could rattle markets. We don't want to do that. So we're very, very cautious and careful about everything we do. And you've seen that, but that's not to say we don't study it. And if appropriate, we might consider something like that in the future. You know that's one of those areas where everybody has a different opinion and we don't publish our opinion. I think you know what our pricing is. And so I think you should apply that to your own best estimates as a guide to making your decisions about what the future holds for us. I don't know that my speculating on how many rate cut is going to be helpful to anyone. I'm not sure that my opinion is worth more than anyone else's. Yes, absolutely. What you point out is something that we used to experience a lot in our applications business five and 10 years ago, where we were very much under budget pressure. And so when our customers were under a lot of budget pressure, the sales cycle stretched out and decisions were postponed and deals were postponed. We see much less of that now. What we see is that the platform is truly a strategic investment by our customers. It tends to be decided at the C-suite level and so I won't say that we're immune to budgetary pressures. But I think that there is this imperative for our customers to make a transition to digital relationships with their consumer customers and they want the kind of power that our platform brings. And their choice is really to try to build it themselves some kind of homegrown solution or to buy it from FICO because there's really not any meaningful competition in terms of features and functionality with our platform. And as between building it in-house and buying the FICO solution, we've invested close to $1 billion in our software business to get to this point. And there are a few customers with the wherewithal to make those kinds of investments. And so any kind of a homegrown solution is just not going to be competitive with what they -- FICO at a fraction of the cost. And so what we see is tremendous adoption of our platform because they do the analysis, and it's a very cost-effective solution, and they get more functionality than they were planning on. They get it much faster than they could if they did it themselves. And so that's really kind of how that decision is going down. So budgetary pressure, who knows, with less budgetary pressure, maybe we'd be doing even better than we are, we can't really say. But we are not experiencing a lot of slowdown because of budget pressures. There are a lot of factors that go into it. There's not a formula. It's not formulaic, but we look at everything. We do look at volumes. We look at the market. We think a lot about whether the price is fair, whether we're asking our customers to pay a price that exceeds the value that we provide. And we think a lot about those things. And you can probably imagine my view on this, which is that we think it's tremendous value. And so we're fine with where we are. Every year is different. The percentage increases each year are different. The dollar amount increases are different each year. There's not a formula for it. And we sit down in the couple of months before the September 1 rate card gets published to our partners and we think about it. We also have discussions with them. So there's just a lot of factors that go into it. No. There's nothing -- there's nothing there. It's based on volumes. I mean some volumes get a little bit more, a little bit less. It's just volumes and amounted usage we had this quarter. It's worth pointing out. I mean, how do we think about that business -- we have this very strong legacy business where we have large market share in a half dozen very important applications for our customers. They typically renew on like a three-year renewal cycle, that's not -- it varies, but it happens often. And we're not in a big hurry to push them to the platform. We have our hands full with new business on the platform. And so as long as we have customers who are happy to renew the legacy products, we're happy with that. And we continue to invest in those legacy products to make sure that the features and functionality are appropriate for today and for tomorrow and for the future. So I think our legacy business is going to be healthy for a very long time to come. We're not really pushing to grow it quickly. And we're also -- we're not in a harvest mode either. We make modest investment to keep it current. And the fluctuation, whether it's a little over 100% or a little below 100% in terms of where we stand. That tends to be volume driven. It tends to be usage by our customers that pushes us there. Okay. So with respect to auto and card, those two businesses look today like they did a year ago and like they did 2 years ago, very little change competitively. Our customers continue to use our products and just not a lot of change there, not a lot of competitive threat, not a lot of new innovation coming from competitors. So really kind of no change there. With respect to capital allocation, our strategy there remains unchanged. As you know, we strive to return capital to our shareholders. We have a very efficient business model. We try to run a pretty efficient balance sheet. We try to manage our leverage to between two and three times and have some level of efficiency there. And it is remarkable to say with a PE north of 100 that we still think our stock is a screaming value, but we really do believe that. And I have -- I've been doing these calls now for 13 years, and every single call, it seems like our stock is at an all-time high, and people wonder why are you still buying back your stock? And to date, it's been a pretty good call. We expect that to continue. We have every intention of returning free cash flow and then some to our shareholders through stock buyback. We wonder the same thing, and I think no one knows I don't think it's a secret that the industry has been slow to move on the expected implementation because there are some things that still have to be sorted out. The FHFA has a plan. We're working with them, cooperating with them every way we can to see it happen. But there's no telling what a new administration might do. They -- it's just really hard to say. Maybe things take a little bit longer than they otherwise might have. That's probably the most likely scenario. But there could be a change in direction, one just doesn't know. Yes. There's a few ways we're going at that. I mean, at the upper end of the ecosystem, we're working with partners. So I mentioned TCS was one, but we're in conversations with a number and have deals with a number of other partners. So the big systems integrators, they are very natural partners for us to get into other verticals. And they have customers, they have distribution, they have skills, they have domain expertise and they can take that, apply it to our IP and provide solutions in these other verticals. And so that's clearly a very efficient way for us to get into kind of more diversified markets. The other thing that we're focused on, which I think is going to take longer is, I wouldn't call it quite a self-service model, but more a self-service model where we have open APIs and ISVs and resellers and VARs have the opportunity to come and leverage our platform and our IP with very little intervention from us. And in the long run, we'd really like to see that flourish. We have a marketplace that we've built to facilitate this. But I think that's going to take time to build. Yes. I think that the two things going on there. One is the new pricing each year goes into effect on Jan 1, but our fiscal runs from October 1 to September 30. So obviously, there's a 1-quarter discrepancy in the pricing -- and when the pricing gets, so that's one factor that influences it. And then the other, as Steve mentioned earlier, is a lot of our channel partner customers have multiyear deals. And so -- and when they do, we honor the prices from prior years. And so that's another thing that can affect that relationship."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Singleton. Please go ahead.\nDave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's third quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber. Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. And on this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business. Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the risk factors and forward-looking statements portions of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team. This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. And a replay of this webcast will be available through July 31, 2025. Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we will be referencing during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We continue to deliver strong quarterly results, including impressive growth in our ACV bookings and free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the third quarter financial highlights, we reported Q3 revenues of $448 million, up 12% over the last year. We delivered $126 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, down 2% and GAAP earnings of $5.05 per share, down 1% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 net income was $156 million with earnings of $6.25 per share, up 9% and 10%, respectively. We had a difficult comp in year-over-year net income as Q3 of 2023 included an $8.5 million onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs as well as a $9.5 million reduction in income tax expense associated with the valuation of our R&D credits. We delivered record free cash flow of $206 million in our third quarter and $551 million over the last four quarters. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q3, we repurchased 196,000 shares at an average price of $1,293 per share, and we announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion of share repurchase. In our Scores segment on Page 6 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues were $241 million, up 20% versus the prior year. Breaking that down, in B2B, current quarter revenues were up 27% versus the prior year. In B2C, the current quarter revenues were down 2% versus the prior year. Third quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 80% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 49% of B2B revenue and 39% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 3%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 7% versus the prior year. We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10-T for non-GSE mortgages. Based on 2023 firm reported data, clients with over $126 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $380 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10-T. Firms are using FICO 10-T to make credit decisions, delivered to investors and for securitization. FICO 10-T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. In our Software segment, we delivered $206 million in Q3 revenue, up 5% and from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 10%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR growing 3%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 108%, with platform NRR at 124% and non-platform NRR at 101%. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were an impressive $27.5 million. We continue to drive more FICO platform SaaS bookings, which aligns with our strategy. We expect this trend to continue as our recent FICO World event has been a catalyst for driving pipeline growth, especially for the FICO platform. I'm very proud of the strength of our software business, both the industry-leading technology as well as our remarkable team. This quarter, we secured another award for our FICO platform, the business intelligence platform in the year from data breakthrough. In July, Nikhil Behl was promoted to EVP for software, leading all technology and go-to-market functions. Nikhil has been instrumental in strengthening our brand value, reputation with customers and regulators, strategic competitive positioning for FICO scores and FICO platform and market-leading business growth. We continue to excel in our Scores business as well. Our team is focused on innovation to provide new ways to add value for our customers. FICO scores a tool that market participants rely on to make many crucial decisions, including prequel [ph] underwriting, pricing, ensuring, securitizing, rating, selling, assessing capital requirements, assessing prepayment risk and determining collection strategies. The FICO Score has long been freely chosen because it's trusted as the most predictive and reliable independent credit score, enabling lenders to fairly expand credit access to more consumers. The FICO Score was widely adopted because it democratized and expanded access to credit while simultaneously underpinning the safety and soundness of the market. It's worth pointing out that over half of mortgage market is not conforming and also overwhelmingly uses FICO scores. The FICO Score is provided and will continue to provide tremendous value to the credit ecosystem. As part of our ongoing commitment to industry-leading credit decision, we've made significant commitments to financial knowledge and financial inclusion. We've once again partnered with Chelsea Football Club, both men's and women's teams and U.S. Soccer Foundation for the field of financial empowerment summer tour. The goal is to build excitement for and access to financial education and resources to help more people, including the next generation of fans make more informed credit decisions. As part of the campaign, FICO host free score a better future fundamentals, financial education workshops for students from traditionally underserved communities. Students improve financial literacy and have the opportunity to attend a Chelsea football game. I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance after Steve provides further financial details.\nSteve Weber: Thanks, Will and good afternoon everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another good quarter with total revenues of $448 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Score segment revenues for the quarter were $241 million, up 20% from Q3of 2023. B2B revenues were up 27%, driven primarily by mortgage origination revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 2% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our on myFICO.com business. Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $206 million, up 5% versus Q 32023. On prem and SaaS, software revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. This quarter. 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is the combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region generated 5%. Our total software ARR was $710 million, a 10% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $215 million, representing 30% of our total Q3 '24 ARR, up from 25% of total in of 2023. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non platform ARR grew 3% to $495 million this quarter. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 108%. Platform NRR was 124% while our non platform NRR was 101%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $27.5 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services. Our expenses for the quarter - total operating expenses were $258 million this quarter versus $220 million $2 million in the prior year and the increase of 16% year-over-year and 8% versus the prior quarter. Our third quarter included our FICO World event and a true up for our annual incentive rewards, and we expect Q4 expenses to be down modestly from our Q3 run rate. As Will noted, the prior year includes an $8.5 million one time reimbursement of third party data implementation costs and a reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. Our non GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg-G schedule was 52% for the quarter, compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $126 million, down 2% from the prior year's quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $156 million with a quarter of 9% from the prior year's quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024, net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, a 69% increase from the previous year. The trailing 12 month free cash flow was $551 million compared to $467 million in the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $199 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.13 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. Currently, 61% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. During the quarter, we secured a $450 million term loan and used those proceeds to reduce our revolving line of credit and to provide additional debt capacity. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 196,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $1,293 per share. That exhausted the existing board authorization, which was approved in January, and we have just announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and the increase in our full year guidance.\nWill Lansing: Thanks, Steve. We are executing on our strategy. Our customers are delighted with our innovative products. Our execution is generating strong financial results, including impressive ACV bookings, record free cash flow and an increase in FICO platform and FICO 10-T adoption. The business is strong. I'm pleased to report that today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.70 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million with GAAP earnings per share of $19.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $582 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $23.16. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session.\nDave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Thank you. And our first question is going to come from the line of Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes. Hi. Thank you so much. So I wanted to start with the software business and just ask you if you could comment on the selling environment. If there's any change from a macro perspective, anything new or different you're hearing from your customers? And then I know at FICO World, we had talked about improvement of the platform and talking about decomposition of the platform. So just give us a sense of if there's any update there and any additional color?\nWill Lansing: FICO World is always and was this year the biggest pipeline generating event that we have. And so we came out of FICO World with a very, very healthy pipeline. I would say that the selling environment has not changed that much over the last year or so. And I would also emphasize that increasingly, customers are buying FICO software as a strategic move. And so it's a very considered purchase. And it's not just like going out and finding a point solution to a small problem, to a specific problem. It's a bigger thing than that. And that hasn't changed. That's kind of the new way of operating.\nFaiza Alwy: Got it. Thank you. And then just a question on mortgage revenues. You obviously had very strong growth in the quarter. I'm curious how volume trended in the quarter? I know you don't give a breakdown, but was it in line with your expectations? Are there any dynamics you're seeing around soft fold where I believe lenders have the option to go to one or two bureaus like that? Are you seeing an impact on volumes from that and just the general environment around more...\nWill Lansing: Our mortgage volumes are a lagging indicator relative to other mortgage data that you have. Our mortgage volumes are down versus a year ago, they're pretty much flat versus a quarter - last quarter. And then none of that is particularly surprising.\nFaiza Alwy: All right. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. First question on just the guidance raise. It implies revenues are going to be down roughly $10 million quarter-over-quarter. Just any color there? I know you normally are conservative in the guide, but just can you do the walk for us from 3Q to fiscal...\nSteve Weber: Yes. So we are pretty conservative with the way we guide. So we want to make sure that a lot of the -- on the Scores, we don't have much control over, right? So we don't really know what's going to happen there. I would say that generally, the fourth quarter is a little lighter seasonally for mortgage. Mortgage volumes aren't as high, typically then as they are in the spring. So there might be some -- a little bit of volume decline there, but a lot of it just spends in the environment which we don't have a lot of visibility to.\nSurinder Thind: Thank you. And then in terms of just when I think about the non-platform business here. The NRR was 101%. That's the slowest pace of growth in about 2 years. So any color there that you can help with? Is there some movement of revenues from non-platform to platform at this point? How should we think about that?\nWill Lansing: I wouldn't say that it's cannibalization if that's what your question is getting at. We're pretty pleased with our classic offerings with 101% NRR. We've been trying to manage that business in this relatively flat way, and we're pleased that it's turning out that way. But as you can see, the growth is on the expand side on the platform. It's -- we don't -- we let the market tell us what it wants, but we're not displeased with the way it's shaking out.\nSteve Weber: Yes. And I would say, I mean, we had higher numbers last year. And at the time, we said there were some things driving that. Some of it was some of the CPI increase that we had. And we had some advantages last year from some FX as well. And we knew that we're not going to maintain this year. So it's kind of what we thought was going to happen, it would settle more to around 100%.\nSurinder Thind: Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue for additional questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question . And our next question is going to come from the line of Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey, good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the auto origination side. Revenue is down 3% versus modestly up last quarter. Just wondering, similar to how you did a mortgage, maybe comment on the volumes there and how they trended versus last quarter?\nWill Lansing: Yes, volumes were relatively flat, but there really is a mix shift. So we had more of a mix shift to more market share in the peers that are a little bit less price for us. Unit cost is a little bit lower. So that's really the difference between the volume and the revenue. So the price per score went down slightly because of a mix shift.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the software side, on the platform ARR, I mean, I think it's pretty good to see the sort of rate of deceleration moderate from 2Q to 3Q at sort of this low 30s level. I mean, do you kind of see this as a sort of sustainable growth rate for platform ARR over the near to medium term here?\nWill Lansing: Probably, yes. I mean we don't -- we think we're pretty confident in that at around that rate. It can change as we go out further, but we think that's a sustainable rate. And we've got -- it helps when you have a good quarter like this in terms of signing new deals, too, because that will help boost the ARR in the future. So we don't have really good visibility to because a lot of it depends on how quickly our customers can get online and how much usage they have, but there's a lot of growth there. So we're pretty confident that we can maintain these levels.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nKyle Peterson: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to start out on software, particularly the bookings looked pretty nice on an ACV basis, come a lot of the prior quarters. So how should we think about some of the implementation cycles and kind of when some of those bookings will start to translate to revenue here?\nWill Lansing: Well, it's -- as you know, it's a long sales cycle as long as 400 days, and it takes not that long to get live once it's all said and done. But I think that the flow-through is the subsequent year. I mean that's the easiest way to think about it.\nSteve Weber: Yes. And it does depend on the customer, how sophisticated they are, how ready they are. But yes, I mean, if you sign deals now in the next 6 to 9 months, you should start seeing a flow-through on that.\nKyle Peterson: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just a follow-up on -- particularly on if we do get rate cuts, whether it's later this year or next year, maybe if you could walk us through some of the different sensitivities. I know your business now looks quite a bit different maybe compared to past cycles. So especially in those first one to two rate cuts, what are some of the impacts that we should be mindful of if those do come to fruition?\nWill Lansing: We're already seeing a little bit of an uptick in refi and it's not exactly a gigantic leap of faith that as rates come down, we'll see volumes go up. We fully anticipate that. Your guess is as good as ours as to the timing of the rate cuts. We would hope to see some rate cuts towards the end of this year and next year and volumes go up with that.\nKyle Peterson: All right, that's helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Within the Scores business, card and personal loan revenue fell 7% in the quarter, which is a little bit better than the 9% decline in the prior quarter. Can you talk about some of the trends you're seeing among subprime or lower tier consumers that may be impacting card and personal loan performance and also talk about overall bank lending conditions?\nWill Lansing: Yes. I mean the subprime markets obviously seem the biggest pullback, which is not surprising, right? You're late in the credit cycle, you have a lot more uncertainty, and that's kind of where you see that happen first. Bank by bank, it kind of varies depending on what they're looking at and what kind of what kind of campaigns they might -- may or may not be running. But we see banks being relatively conservative with new originations. And I think we're kind of waiting to see what happens and see what the economic environment looks like. So it's really not surprising. We saw probably a little over a year ago, strong growth there when mortgage started to slow down and rates start to go up, we saw strong growth there. But now I think there's just more uncertainty in the market, and they're just kind of being more cautious in their originations.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then switching to the software side, software operating margins contracted about 430 bps year-over-year in the quarter. Can you talk about some of the reasons behind that...\nWill Lansing: It's almost completely around that reimbursement we had last year. So that was a big number we had, and that was all on the software side. So that's the driver of that.\nGeorge Tong: And so as that lapse, when would you expect to flip to margin expansion in the software business?\nWill Lansing: Well, we'll get some margin expansion next quarter because, I mean, again, we had some costs at FICO World this quarter was not going to repeat next quarter. So we'll have some -- our costs will decline next quarter, and that will end up with some margin expansion. We -- these costs are big enough where any one given quarter, something like FICO is going to have an impact on that quarter's margin.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking the question. Just on the software revenue growth, particularly the on-prem and SaaS. And within that, when I look at software recognized over the contract term, the growth there moderated. How should we think about the growth profile there?\nWill Lansing: Ashish, we can't hear you. We can't hear you.\nAshish Sabadra: Sorry. Let me know better. Yes. So I wanted to focus on the on-prem and SaaS software revenue growth. And within that, even the software recognized over contract term that moderated a bit, still pretty strong at 80%, but did moderate from mid-teens. How should we think about those puts and takes on the revenue growth going forward?\nWill Lansing: Yes. I mean a lot of that is the fact that we had the Omega growth the non-platform growth to what we saw last year. So that right there drives most of the -- and obviously, the platform side is growing 50% either. But -- so we think these kind of growth rates going forward, as I said earlier, that's probably more likely, but we're going to see it continue. And as the numbers get bigger, it's harder to drive 50% growth, 3% to 4% growth. So we're pretty happy with the 30% growth on the platform side and on the non-platform we think we can get better than 100%. We're happy with that as well.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful. Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Your line open. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to cycle back to the 3%0 plus growth in the platform software ARR. And just -- I was wondering if you could just give in a little bit more detail as to why you think that, that is a sustainable level of growth? And just perhaps flesh that out a little bit more for us, please?\nWill Lansing: Well, I mean, we've got -- I mean, again, we had a really good quarter with new bookings, and we've got a lot of installed base that's rapidly expanding. I mean when we install most of our customers look for new ways to use it, and we see that in the net retention rate. And that's -- that number continues to be do well, and we continue to add more business to it. So we can't guarantee it, but we've got a lot of reasons, both data-driven and anecdotally to think that we're going to continue to see that kind of growth.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Thanks. And just to follow up on that. Could you -- I mean, just frame the approach to pricing within the software business. You mentioned last year in the, I think it was the non-platform side, you had sort of higher inflationary pricing. But just wondering if you could talk a bit about the strategy around the pricing, pricing value and how to think about that going forward?\nWill Lansing: Our strategy around software pricing is -- we're very focused right now on making our software accessible and encouraging adoption. And so while there's probably room for value pricing in our software business, that's not where our direction is. Our direction is to put the software in the hands of our customers and then watch revenue grow as their usage increases. And the usage increases within the initial applications that they put the platform to use for. And then also, as they discover new uses, the expand part of our land expand strategy is very much wrapped around the customer taking control of what they can do with the platform and coming up with new use cases. And we tend to design in a way that we don't have to renegotiate contracts and go back and do a lot of contractual work for them to do more revenue with us. we tend to design it in a way that they can select how much usage they want and our revenue goes up automatically as their usage goes up.\nSimon Clinch: Thank so much. Appreciate it.\nOperat0: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJeff Meuler: Yeah, thanks. Instead of me getting to ask a question about cash flow this quarter, I just got to say congrats on the nice cash flow. Can you give us some perspective on the geographic kind of trends within software? And I guess it looks like America's revenue was down a little year over year. So any particular call outs? And then EMEA was up a lot. So just any mega wins in EMEA or any reason to think that you're at an inflection point there and it's really taking off.\nWill Lansing: You know, Jeff, I don't think that we have tremendous changes regionally. I wouldn't try to read too much into the data on a quarterly basis. We have strength of platform across all the regions. I think Asia Pacific was a little behind the other regions in terms of platform adoption, and there were some structural reasons for that. For example, AWS was not available in India before and now it is. But we're seeing adoption across all the regions. Yes, I would think some of what you see might see with the volatility is when we have that point-in-time license revenue, and that could skew things in one given quarter. But we've had a lot of adoption in the last year in North America, and we're starting to see a lot more interest to in EMEA as well.\nJeff Meuler: And then when you're calling out the FICO 10-T adoption and then the nonperforming mortgage market, is that almost exclusively about upgrades from prior versions of the FICO score given how high your penetration is? Or are you finding, I guess, like incremental volume as part of that adoption?\nWill Lansing: It's a bit of both, but probably more of the upgrade.\nSteve Weber: Yes. I mean for the most part, everybody was using the traditional FICO scores and now they're just moving to the 10-k [ph] ahead of the adoption by the FHFA.\nJeff Meuler: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question is going to come from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Good evening. I just wanted to ask, Will, I think you tried to reference some of these in your prepared remarks, but in the face of some public criticism around the price of your scores, how is your approach of high process around the value of your score? Maybe the timing around which you get to that value, has that changed at all?\nSteve Weber: Well, you've heard us say in the past, and I certainly continue believe that what in charge to the FICO of you have some public criticism around the price of your stores. Like how is your approach or thought process, Our thought process sis that over time, we're going to close some of that gap. And I think anyone who actually studied the numbers and gets into the details of it, sees the FICO scores are a tiny piece of the overall process, whether you're talking mortgage or any other kind of credit evaluation process. And so I would say no, no real change anticipated.\nManav Patnaik: Okay. And then somewhat similarly, on the software side, I think you talked about that value proposition being unique and niche, et cetera. But we've heard obviously a lot of other software companies during learning season talk about the weak environment and the slowdown. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any of that, but anything you'd like to call out? Was there may be some -- could it be a lag that you see some of these headwinds or perhaps you're not seeing that at all?\nSteve Weber: We're really not seeing that. That's not -- I mean, we've certainly heard that and I guess the industry is experiencing that, but we haven't felt that.\nManav Patnaik: Okay, fair enough. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, this will also conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day. Goodbye.+",

            "name": "Steve Weber",
            "content": "Thanks, Will and good afternoon everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another good quarter with total revenues of $448 million, an increase of 12% over the prior year. Score segment revenues for the quarter were $241 million, up 20% from Q3of 2023. B2B revenues were up 27%, driven primarily by mortgage origination revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 2% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our on myFICO.com business. Software segment revenues in the third quarter were $206 million, up 5% versus Q 32023. On prem and SaaS, software revenue grew 7% year-over-year, while professional services declined 9%. This quarter. 85% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is the combination of our North America and Latin American regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues and the Asia Pacific region generated 5%. Our total software ARR was $710 million, a 10% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR was $215 million, representing 30% of our total Q3 '24 ARR, up from 25% of total in of 2023. Platform ARR grew 31% versus the prior year, while non platform ARR grew 3% to $495 million this quarter. Our platform land and expand strategy continues to be successful. Our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 108%. Platform NRR was 124% while our non platform NRR was 101%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $27.5 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services. Our expenses for the quarter - total operating expenses were $258 million this quarter versus $220 million $2 million in the prior year and the increase of 16% year-over-year and 8% versus the prior quarter. Our third quarter included our FICO World event and a true up for our annual incentive rewards, and we expect Q4 expenses to be down modestly from our Q3 run rate. As Will noted, the prior year includes an $8.5 million one time reimbursement of third party data implementation costs and a reduction to income tax expense of $9.5 million associated with the valuation of our R&D tax credits. Our non GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg-G schedule was 52% for the quarter, compared with 51% in the same quarter last year. GAAP net income this quarter was $126 million, down 2% from the prior year's quarter. Our non GAAP net income was $156 million with a quarter of 9% from the prior year's quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.5%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024, net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. The recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items. Free cash flow for the quarter was $206 million, a 69% increase from the previous year. The trailing 12 month free cash flow was $551 million compared to $467 million in the prior quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had $199 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $2.13 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. Currently, 61% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods. During the quarter, we secured a $450 million term loan and used those proceeds to reduce our revolving line of credit and to provide additional debt capacity. Turning to return of capital. We bought back 196,000 shares in the third quarter at an average price of $1,293 per share. That exhausted the existing board authorization, which was approved in January, and we have just announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion. We continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash. And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and the increase in our full year guidance. Yes. So we are pretty conservative with the way we guide. So we want to make sure that a lot of the -- on the Scores, we don't have much control over, right? So we don't really know what's going to happen there. I would say that generally, the fourth quarter is a little lighter seasonally for mortgage. Mortgage volumes aren't as high, typically then as they are in the spring. So there might be some -- a little bit of volume decline there, but a lot of it just spends in the environment which we don't have a lot of visibility to. Yes. And I would say, I mean, we had higher numbers last year. And at the time, we said there were some things driving that. Some of it was some of the CPI increase that we had. And we had some advantages last year from some FX as well. And we knew that we're not going to maintain this year. So it's kind of what we thought was going to happen, it would settle more to around 100%. Yes. And it does depend on the customer, how sophisticated they are, how ready they are. But yes, I mean, if you sign deals now in the next 6 to 9 months, you should start seeing a flow-through on that. Yes.

            "name": "Will Lansing",
            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we will be referencing during our presentation. Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We continue to deliver strong quarterly results, including impressive growth in our ACV bookings and free cash flow. As shown on Page 2 of the third quarter financial highlights, we reported Q3 revenues of $448 million, up 12% over the last year. We delivered $126 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, down 2% and GAAP earnings of $5.05 per share, down 1% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q3 net income was $156 million with earnings of $6.25 per share, up 9% and 10%, respectively. We had a difficult comp in year-over-year net income as Q3 of 2023 included an $8.5 million onetime reimbursement of third-party data implementation costs as well as a $9.5 million reduction in income tax expense associated with the valuation of our R&D credits. We delivered record free cash flow of $206 million in our third quarter and $551 million over the last four quarters. We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q3, we repurchased 196,000 shares at an average price of $1,293 per share, and we announced a new Board authorization for $1 billion of share repurchase. In our Scores segment on Page 6 of the presentation, our third quarter revenues were $241 million, up 20% versus the prior year. Breaking that down, in B2B, current quarter revenues were up 27% versus the prior year. In B2C, the current quarter revenues were down 2% versus the prior year. Third quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 80% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 49% of B2B revenue and 39% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 3%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 7% versus the prior year. We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10-T for non-GSE mortgages. Based on 2023 firm reported data, clients with over $126 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $380 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10-T. Firms are using FICO 10-T to make credit decisions, delivered to investors and for securitization. FICO 10-T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA's implementation of enterprise credit score requirements. In our Software segment, we delivered $206 million in Q3 revenue, up 5% and from last year, driven mainly by growth in SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land and expand strategy with expand driven by increased customer usage. As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 10%, with platform ARR growing 31% and non-platform ARR growing 3%. Total NRR for the quarter shown on Page 8, was 108%, with platform NRR at 124% and non-platform NRR at 101%. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were an impressive $27.5 million. We continue to drive more FICO platform SaaS bookings, which aligns with our strategy. We expect this trend to continue as our recent FICO World event has been a catalyst for driving pipeline growth, especially for the FICO platform. I'm very proud of the strength of our software business, both the industry-leading technology as well as our remarkable team. This quarter, we secured another award for our FICO platform, the business intelligence platform in the year from data breakthrough. In July, Nikhil Behl was promoted to EVP for software, leading all technology and go-to-market functions. Nikhil has been instrumental in strengthening our brand value, reputation with customers and regulators, strategic competitive positioning for FICO scores and FICO platform and market-leading business growth. We continue to excel in our Scores business as well. Our team is focused on innovation to provide new ways to add value for our customers. FICO scores a tool that market participants rely on to make many crucial decisions, including prequel [ph] underwriting, pricing, ensuring, securitizing, rating, selling, assessing capital requirements, assessing prepayment risk and determining collection strategies. The FICO Score has long been freely chosen because it's trusted as the most predictive and reliable independent credit score, enabling lenders to fairly expand credit access to more consumers. The FICO Score was widely adopted because it democratized and expanded access to credit while simultaneously underpinning the safety and soundness of the market. It's worth pointing out that over half of mortgage market is not conforming and also overwhelmingly uses FICO scores. The FICO Score is provided and will continue to provide tremendous value to the credit ecosystem. As part of our ongoing commitment to industry-leading credit decision, we've made significant commitments to financial knowledge and financial inclusion. We've once again partnered with Chelsea Football Club, both men's and women's teams and U.S. Soccer Foundation for the field of financial empowerment summer tour. The goal is to build excitement for and access to financial education and resources to help more people, including the next generation of fans make more informed credit decisions. As part of the campaign, FICO host free score a better future fundamentals, financial education workshops for students from traditionally underserved communities. Students improve financial literacy and have the opportunity to attend a Chelsea football game. I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance after Steve provides further financial details. Thanks, Steve. We are executing on our strategy. Our customers are delighted with our innovative products. Our execution is generating strong financial results, including impressive ACV bookings, record free cash flow and an increase in FICO platform and FICO 10-T adoption. The business is strong. I'm pleased to report that today, we're again raising our full year guidance as we enter the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.70 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $500 million with GAAP earnings per share of $19.90. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $582 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $23.16. With that, I'll turn it back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session. FICO World is always and was this year the biggest pipeline generating event that we have. And so we came out of FICO World with a very, very healthy pipeline. I would say that the selling environment has not changed that much over the last year or so. And I would also emphasize that increasingly, customers are buying FICO software as a strategic move. And so it's a very considered purchase. And it's not just like going out and finding a point solution to a small problem, to a specific problem. It's a bigger thing than that. And that hasn't changed. That's kind of the new way of operating. Our mortgage volumes are a lagging indicator relative to other mortgage data that you have. Our mortgage volumes are down versus a year ago, they're pretty much flat versus a quarter - last quarter. And then none of that is particularly surprising. I wouldn't say that it's cannibalization if that's what your question is getting at. We're pretty pleased with our classic offerings with 101% NRR. We've been trying to manage that business in this relatively flat way, and we're pleased that it's turning out that way. But as you can see, the growth is on the expand side on the platform. It's -- we don't -- we let the market tell us what it wants, but we're not displeased with the way it's shaking out. Yes, volumes were relatively flat, but there really is a mix shift. So we had more of a mix shift to more market share in the peers that are a little bit less price for us. Unit cost is a little bit lower. So that's really the difference between the volume and the revenue. So the price per score went down slightly because of a mix shift. Probably, yes. I mean we don't -- we think we're pretty confident in that at around that rate. It can change as we go out further, but we think that's a sustainable rate. And we've got -- it helps when you have a good quarter like this in terms of signing new deals, too, because that will help boost the ARR in the future. So we don't have really good visibility to because a lot of it depends on how quickly our customers can get online and how much usage they have, but there's a lot of growth there. So we're pretty confident that we can maintain these levels. Well, it's -- as you know, it's a long sales cycle as long as 400 days, and it takes not that long to get live once it's all said and done. But I think that the flow-through is the subsequent year. I mean that's the easiest way to think about it. We're already seeing a little bit of an uptick in refi and it's not exactly a gigantic leap of faith that as rates come down, we'll see volumes go up. We fully anticipate that. Your guess is as good as ours as to the timing of the rate cuts. We would hope to see some rate cuts towards the end of this year and next year and volumes go up with that. Yes. I mean the subprime markets obviously seem the biggest pullback, which is not surprising, right? You're late in the credit cycle, you have a lot more uncertainty, and that's kind of where you see that happen first. Bank by bank, it kind of varies depending on what they're looking at and what kind of what kind of campaigns they might -- may or may not be running. But we see banks being relatively conservative with new originations. And I think we're kind of waiting to see what happens and see what the economic environment looks like. So it's really not surprising. We saw probably a little over a year ago, strong growth there when mortgage started to slow down and rates start to go up, we saw strong growth there. But now I think there's just more uncertainty in the market, and they're just kind of being more cautious in their originations. It's almost completely around that reimbursement we had last year. So that was a big number we had, and that was all on the software side. So that's the driver of that. Well, we'll get some margin expansion next quarter because, I mean, again, we had some costs at FICO World this quarter was not going to repeat next quarter. So we'll have some -- our costs will decline next quarter, and that will end up with some margin expansion. We -- these costs are big enough where any one given quarter, something like FICO is going to have an impact on that quarter's margin. Ashish, we can't hear you. We can't hear you. Yes. I mean a lot of that is the fact that we had the Omega growth the non-platform growth to what we saw last year. So that right there drives most of the -- and obviously, the platform side is growing 50% either. But -- so we think these kind of growth rates going forward, as I said earlier, that's probably more likely, but we're going to see it continue. And as the numbers get bigger, it's harder to drive 50% growth, 3% to 4% growth. So we're pretty happy with the 30% growth on the platform side and on the non-platform we think we can get better than 100%. We're happy with that as well. Well, I mean, we've got -- I mean, again, we had a really good quarter with new bookings, and we've got a lot of installed base that's rapidly expanding. I mean when we install most of our customers look for new ways to use it, and we see that in the net retention rate. And that's -- that number continues to be do well, and we continue to add more business to it. So we can't guarantee it, but we've got a lot of reasons, both data-driven and anecdotally to think that we're going to continue to see that kind of growth. Our strategy around software pricing is -- we're very focused right now on making our software accessible and encouraging adoption. And so while there's probably room for value pricing in our software business, that's not where our direction is. Our direction is to put the software in the hands of our customers and then watch revenue grow as their usage increases. And the usage increases within the initial applications that they put the platform to use for. And then also, as they discover new uses, the expand part of our land expand strategy is very much wrapped around the customer taking control of what they can do with the platform and coming up with new use cases. And we tend to design in a way that we don't have to renegotiate contracts and go back and do a lot of contractual work for them to do more revenue with us. we tend to design it in a way that they can select how much usage they want and our revenue goes up automatically as their usage goes up. You know, Jeff, I don't think that we have tremendous changes regionally. I wouldn't try to read too much into the data on a quarterly basis. We have strength of platform across all the regions. I think Asia Pacific was a little behind the other regions in terms of platform adoption, and there were some structural reasons for that. For example, AWS was not available in India before and now it is. But we're seeing adoption across all the regions. Yes, I would think some of what you see might see with the volatility is when we have that point-in-time license revenue, and that could skew things in one given quarter. But we've had a lot of adoption in the last year in North America, and we're starting to see a lot more interest to in EMEA as well. It's a bit of both, but probably more of the upgrade."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dave Singleton. Please go ahead. \nDave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for attending FICO's second quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.\n Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. On this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business.\n Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.\n This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. And a replay of this webcast will be available through April 25, 2025.\n I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. \nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.\n Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We again delivered strong results, demonstrating the resiliency of our business with solid growth both in Scores and in Software.\n As shown on Page 2 of the second quarter financial highlights, we reported Q2 revenues of $434 million, up 14% over the last year. We delivered $130 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 28%. We delivered GAAP earnings of $5.16 per share, up 29% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 net income was $154 million with earnings of $6.14 per share, up 27% and 29%, respectively. We delivered free cash flow of $62 million in our second quarter and $182 million in the first half of fiscal '24.\n We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased 144,000 shares at an average price of $1,246 per share. We have $367 million remaining on our Board repurchase authorization.\n Now in our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues were $237 million, up 19% versus the prior year. In B2B, the current quarter revenues were up 28% versus the prior year. On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 4% versus the prior year.\n Second quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 85% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 46% of B2B revenue and 36% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 1%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 9% versus the prior year.\n We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10 T for nonconforming mortgages. Since 2023, clients with over $100 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $300 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10 T. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA.\n In our Software business, we delivered $197 million in Q2 revenue, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in on-premises and SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage.\n As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 14%, with platform ARR growing 32% and nonplatform ARR growing 8%.\n Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, and nonplatform NRR was 106%.\n Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $17 million. Our pipeline remains strong, especially with platform offerings.\n Before I turn it over to Steve to talk about financial detail, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about the FICO World event we hosted last year -- last week. The 4-day event included 1,200 attendees, representing more than 400 companies from 60 countries. FICO World brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe to discuss the benefits of making real-time decisions at scale through the power of the FICO platform.\n Current customers explained the benefits of improved profits, increased customer acquisition and retention, reduced costs, growth in new product offerings and improved employee efficiency. Through FICO platform demonstrations in our innovation center, customers experienced real examples of the variety of use cases that can be deployed using the FICO platform.\n At FICO World, we announced several innovations. We responded to market demand with an open API framework, a FICO marketplace open ecosystem and business composability. Together, these innovations foster a more collaborative environment by reducing silos and creating transparency into future outcomes.\n Some of the content from FICO World will be available in the coming weeks on our YouTube channel. I'd encourage all of you to view the demonstrations and presentations to better understand our customers' excitement around this innovative technology.\n I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance, but first, let me turn it to Steve for further details. \nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $434 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $237 million, up 19% from Q2 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 28% driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 4% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business.\n Software revenues in the second quarter were $197 million, up 8% versus Q2 2023. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew year-over-year, while professional services revenues declined.\n This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.\n Our total software ARR was $697 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR topped $200 million this year for the first time at $201 million and represented 29% of our total Q2 ARR, up from 25% of the total in Q2 of 2023. Platform ARR grew 32% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 8% to $496 million this quarter.\n Our platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, while our nonplatform NRR was 106%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Nonplatform was driven by customers' increased usage and by CPI price increases.\n Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $16.8 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales and exclude professional services.\n Turning to expenses. Our total operating expenses were $239 million this quarter versus $221 million in the prior year. Our current expenses are a 4% increase over the prior quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we maintained focus on investments to accelerate development of the FICO platform, and that incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.\n Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 53% for the quarter, and that represents a 400 basis point increase from the same quarter last year.\n GAAP net income this quarter was $130 million, up 28% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $154 million for the quarter, up 27% in the prior year's quarter.\n The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. And as a reminder, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items that were recognized.\n Free cash flow for the quarter was $61.6 million, a 30% decrease from the prior year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was 457% -- $457 million compared to $494 million in the prior quarter. We do expect free cash flow to accelerate from the Q2 level in the next 2 quarters.\n At the end of the quarter, we had $177 million in cash and marketable investments.\n Our total debt at quarter end was $2.04 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, [ 63% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.\n In terms of return of capital, we did buy back 144,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $1,246 per share. And at the end of the quarter, we still had $367 million remaining on the Board authorization.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and to give the information on our increase in the full year guidance. \nWilliam Lansing: Thank you, Steve. Our strategy remains consistent despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're experiencing strong growth in our Scores business, even as the current rate environment has driven volumes lower.\n Throughout our business, we continue to invest in innovation. This is particularly evident as we see growing customer adoption and expanded use cases of FICO platform. Our customers are delighted to be able to optimize interactions with their end customers through data-driven, composable solutions that are executed in real time.\n I'm pleased to report that today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the second half of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.69 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $495 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $19.70. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $573 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $22.80.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session. \nDave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: Maybe I'll just start with the Software segment first, Will. Clearly, we were at FICO World and your comments -- both are pretty bullish. But can you just help us appreciate or understand the second quarter in a row of deceleration on the platform side? I think last quarter, you said there were some movement in the bookings or timing, et cetera. So just help us if there's something more of that going on? Is 30% the new level now? Just any help there would be appreciated. \nWilliam Lansing: Yes, absolutely. So as you know, we had many, many quarters of over 50% growth in the platform, and then we had slowed to the 40s, and now we're in the 30s. And I think that's a reasonable and sustainable level for the foreseeable future. I think we had always anticipated some level of slowing just because as that number gets bigger, that was inevitable. And I think that's really all it is.\n We're not seeing anything that's caused for any kind of concern or alarm. Our customers are buying the platform. They're expanding the use cases once they've got the platform in. There's a little bit of timing issues around various deals but I don't think anything really significant. I guess it's probably worth pointing out that the second half of the year is always bigger than the first half. And so there's more to come this year. \nSteven Weber: And Manav, I would just say we had a really difficult comp this quarter, too. Second quarter last year, the platform grew 60%. So we're growing more than 30% off of a pretty big number. It was a big step up last year in the second quarter. \nManav Patnaik: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just one on the Scores, on the mortgage origination side or the moving pieces there, Steve. Maybe just how did volumes come in this quarter versus your expectations? And then when you think about the guidance raise, like what were the moving pieces there as well, please? \nSteven Weber: Yes. I mean you know how we guide. We're pretty conservative. We don't -- we're not banking on things getting better anytime soon. I mean I think even when we gave guidance last year, people at that point we're talking about 6 rate cuts in the year, and we weren't anticipating that.\n So the way we look at the guidance, and mortgage, obviously, being such a big piece of that, is that we don't expect things to get better in our fiscal year. And if they do, great, but it's hard for us to depend on that because obviously, the rates are going to be higher longer than anybody thought. So that's kind of how we look at that. So when they do come down, we'll enjoy that benefit, but we don't try to put a time line on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Faiza Alwy with Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: So I wanted to follow up on mortgage. You've taken obviously a lot of pricing successfully the last couple of years. And I know you have a long-term strategic plan of value creation here. And there's been some noise from regulators, other bodies. I'm curious how you think about that. And what are some of the factors that you're considering as you think about your long-term strategic plan on pricing? \nWilliam Lansing: Well, as we've discussed in the past, we're catching up from 30 years of frozen pricing. And so our putting through price increases in this space is really a matter of trying to close the gap on the value that we provide relative to what we charge.\n The way we think about criticism, because you're right, every once in a while, there is noise about price increases. The way we think about it is transparency is our friend. And so we have increasingly been willing and interested to share exactly what our pricing is because it's such a small part of the overall bundle.\n So if the concern, whether it's from Congress or regulators or third-party groups, is about the level of expense associated with the FICO mortgage score, it's important for everyone to understand that we're talking about single-digit dollars in a bundle that cost a consumer about $6,000. So we point out the gigantic gap between what we charge and the bundle in which we reside. And we think that, that's the way to do it. We think transparency is our friend. \nFaiza Alwy: Great. And then just to follow up on other originations. Maybe you can talk about what you're seeing on the card and auto side in terms of volumes versus pricing. Sort of what's the overall environment like? And maybe if you've adjusted your expectations for volumes just given the macro environment here? \nWilliam Lansing: I don't know that we've really adjusted our expectations. I think that what we're seeing is kind of in line with what we did expect, and it is a function of the macro environment. As we pointed out, we're down a little bit in auto and a little bit more in credit card and other. But I don't think it's any kind of surprise given the macro environment. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. \nSurinder Thind: I'd like to revisit the Software business and more specifically, just kind of the bookings. When you think about the client conversations that you've been having, obviously, quite positive, but how much should we attribute to macro because there has been an overall slowdown? So is the earlier commentary that you -- the slowdown is not macro related to any extent? \nWilliam Lansing: So I think that it's fair to put some of the explanation on macro environment because what we're not seeing is losses to competition. What we are seeing is projects deferred or taking a little bit longer. And so I think it's very fair to attribute some of that to the macro environment. \nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then I guess, turning to the nonplatform piece. When you think about volumes versus pricing, I think you mentioned CPI, but just any other color that you can provide? Is this mostly growth within like Falcon? Or how does pricing work here? Is it just CPI is the right number, and that's how it should continue? Or how should we think about that? \nWilliam Lansing: So as you know, the nonplatform business is very mature and we're deeply embedded, and yet our customers often prefer to renew and renew and renew. And so there's a cycle of multiple renewals typically associated with our licensed software and with our legacy and nonplatform software.\n Our philosophy is to not push the limits on pricing there. The customers are the same customers who are buying platform from us and customers that we'll have a relationship with for the next 20 or 30 years. And so it's not about harvesting and gouging. We raise our prices to cover costs of adding features and functionality and cybersecurity and keeping the product current. But we're not really pushing the limits of what could be done on price there and don't really intend to. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. \nKyle Peterson: I wanted to start on capital return. Obviously, it looks like you guys bought back a little bit more past quarter than the first quarter. How should we think about the pace of buybacks in the back half of the year? Obviously, you've seen a bit of a pullback in the shares, obviously, with market and such. And then also just given some of your comments on potential for free cash flow to accelerate as the year progresses. I just want to get your opinion on how you guys are thinking about that over the next few quarters. \nWilliam Lansing: We remain as committed to buyback as we have ever been. And it is our intent to continue to spend at least our free cash flow and often in excess of our free cash flow on buyback every year. And I don't expect that would change. Our leverage has slipped a bit as our earnings have gone up. And I guess that's a happy bonus of being more profitable. And in the fullness of time, you'll see that reflected in increased buyback. \nKyle Peterson: Got it. That makes sense, and that's helpful. And just a follow-up, I guess, on the professional services piece of the business, I guess that revenue is falling off a bit. I guess that it's lower margin. But I just want to get your sense as to kind of is this, call it, $19 million to $22 million a quarter, is that kind of a good range to use moving forward given the mix of the business that you guys are selling? Or was there anything kind of onetime in this past quarter that dragged it down a bit below kind of historical levels? \nWilliam Lansing: I think it's a reasonable range to anticipate going forward. We love our professional services, and yet we're not a professional services company, first and foremost, we're a software company. And so our goal with professional services is to provide enough PS to manage quality installs and keep our customers happy.\n We're also delighted to have partners do the installation from us, and we're bringing out partners to do some of that work. I don't imagine that our PS will shrink much more than it already has. As you know, it's come down quite a bit. And we're probably pretty close to -- I think we're at kind of a base level that it would be hard to imagine going below. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC. \nAshish Sabadra: I just had a quick question on the expense trajectory. I was wondering if you -- what should we expect there, both in terms of either sequential or year-on-year growth in expenses for the rest of the year? \nSteven Weber: Yes. So we had -- we said we had FICO World this quarter. So there's -- that's a pretty significant expense for us. So you'll see an increase in our Q3 spending by a little bit that's associated with that. And then the fourth quarter would probably be relatively flat to that or maybe even down a little bit. But we don't expect any significant uptick in expenses for the rest of the year. Really, it's basically due to the FICO World being held this quarter. \nAshish Sabadra: That's helpful color. And maybe just from a modeling perspective, the on-prem software, again, the de-emphasis there, that's maybe one of the reasons why that piece of the Software revenue has been muted. How should we think about that going forward? Any color? \nWilliam Lansing: About the on-prem software? \nAshish Sabadra: Yes. \nSteven Weber: So I mean we're focused -- we're cloud-first, right? So we really are focused in the cloud. But if our customers want to run it on-prem, we'll sell it to them that way there. But I would expect that the on-prem piece is probably not going to grow a lot, but it's probably not going to shrink a lot either because a lot of those are deeply embedded, and it's going to take years to move it to the cloud. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: So I want to go back to the card, p loan and other origination revenue down 9%. I think the majority of that is cards. So is pricing a positive contributor to that line? And if so, just based upon the bureaus that have reported thus far, it doesn't seem like card volumes are down that much, but I'd love [ to get your thoughts on ]... \nSteven Weber: It's a little apples and oranges. So this is just the originations piece. I mean our card in total is not down that much because we have a lot of the [ prescreen and ] account management. So the scores are not down that -- this is just the origination subset of that. There's very low pricing in it. So it's probably when you take all that into consideration, I think it's hard to compare our numbers actually across the board of what the bureau has put out.\n But things like card, every bureau has a different subset of banks -- subset of what we have. So there could be a lot of different things happening at different banks. So this is just on the originations piece. \nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then at FICO World, you talked a bit about -- I forget the exact word, I think it's enterprise platform clients. But maybe talk through like how many of your platform clients have a single use case. And then of those, how many of them just signed on within the last year and kind of like what the typical path forward is for them broadening out their use case expansion and how long it typically takes? \nWilliam Lansing: So depending on how you count it, we're in about 130 of the top 300 financial institutions globally. And of that, I'd say, 40% or so are on their first use case, maybe a little bit more than that. \nJeffrey Meuler: And how many of those like just landed with you in the last year? And if you can just kind of like talk about the expansion path. \nWilliam Lansing: I would say most of them have landed in the last year. I mean there's -- the very typical path for the single use case is to eventually move to multiple use cases. And so the ones that are still on one are typically the most recent. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: In Scores, you're catching up from 30 years of frozen pricing to close the gap with what you charge. You're closing the gap more quickly with mortgage than with cards and autos currently. To what extent can pricing in autos and cards close the gap at the same pace as the mortgages over time? What are some of the considerations? \nWilliam Lansing: Well, as we've talked about in the past, we take the entire portfolio of Scores every year, and we evaluate it from top to bottom, thinking through what is the elasticity of demand for that particular kind of a score and where should the Scores prices move by CPI and not more than that and where should they move more than that. And so you're going to see variation in the portfolio always. I would never expect for us to raise prices the same amount across all scores. So yes, you could continue to expect them to be different. \nKeen Fai Tong: Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then with respect to the Software business, you saw 32% platform ARR growth in the quarter from both land and expand. Can you break that down? How much of that growth is coming from new business wins versus wallet penetration from existing customers? \nSteven Weber: Yes, it's hard to do that, George. I mean you can kind of back into it a little bit by looking at the ARR versus the NRR, but we don't have the detail to talk about use cases versus usage. \nKeen Fai Tong: I guess maybe then qualitatively, would you say you're more in land mode or expand mode? \nSteven Weber: Well, I mean, it's -- I mean we're trying to get as much business as we can land in. But a lot of -- it's a lot easier to expand. Once it's in, they find their own use cases a lot of times. So a lot of our growth is coming from expansion because a lot of the initial use cases are really small. They're coming in at a very small amount, and they're expanding off of that. \nWilliam Lansing: And you're on the right question. I think whether it's today or next quarter or the quarter after that, expand will exceed land sooner or later. That's inevitable, that's anticipated, that's coming. I don't think we're quite at the tipping point yet. I think land probably still exceeds expand, but I'm not sure. \nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Dave Singleton for closing remarks. \nDave Singleton: Did you want to check just one more time? Simon might be in the queue for a question, and he just popped in, in the last 5 seconds. \nOperator: We do have a question from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. \nSimon Alistair Clinch: I wanted to ask a couple of questions. So first of all, on the Software side, how should I think about the longer-term sustainable retention rates for both platform and nonplatform? \nSteven Weber: Yes. So the net retention rate on the nonplatform is probably going to dip below 100% at some point. These are legacy products that at some point are going to shift over to the platform. So that's been running probably just slightly above 100% and will probably be there for a while, but it could dip below 100% at some point.\n The net retention rate on the platform, it's been very strong as long as we've been reporting it. So it can vary, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, and there's no real trend to it. You've seen some quarters, it's been as low as in the hundred and teens and some quarters, it's been as high as 140-plus. But we do see continually that all the customers on the platform, almost without fail, use more the following year than they used the previous year. So there's still a lot of room to expand on that, and we think that's going to last for quite a while. \nSimon Alistair Clinch: Okay. Great. And just as a follow-up then. I mean you've managed to grow this business pretty rapidly with minimal sort of expense growth recently. I'm just thinking, when we're thinking out over the next decade, what are the kind of key investment areas you're looking at? And how do we extrapolate that to thinking about the durable expense growth in this business? \nWilliam Lansing: The kind of the key expense, I would say growth. I would -- growth is probably the wrong word. I think we're happy with kind of the expense rates that we have. And if anything, they'll go down over time. But the places where we're spending that money from an R&D standpoint are on the product, on the ecosystem and the marketplace and that side of the house.\n And then I think we also have to think a lot about broadening our distribution because as you know, we have very limited direct distribution, and we have a reasonably nascent indirect partner distribution channel. So there will be more investment on both direct and indirect sales in coming years. \nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back to Dave Singleton for closing. \nDave Singleton: Thank you. Thanks, everyone, for the great questions, and we had another great quarter. That's about all I need to say. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Steven Weber",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $434 million, an increase of 14% over the prior year. Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $237 million, up 19% from Q2 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 28% driven primarily by mortgage originations revenues. Our B2C revenues were down 4% versus the prior year due to volume declines in our myFICO.com business.\n Software revenues in the second quarter were $197 million, up 8% versus Q2 2023. On-premises and SaaS software revenue grew year-over-year, while professional services revenues declined.\n This quarter, 84% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 6%.\n Our total software ARR was $697 million, a 14% increase over the prior year. Platform ARR topped $200 million this year for the first time at $201 million and represented 29% of our total Q2 ARR, up from 25% of the total in Q2 of 2023. Platform ARR grew 32% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 8% to $496 million this quarter.\n Our platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, while our nonplatform NRR was 106%. Platform NRR was driven by a combination of new use cases and increased usage. Nonplatform was driven by customers' increased usage and by CPI price increases.\n Our software ACV bookings for the quarter were $16.8 million. As a reminder, ACV bookings include only the annual value of Software sales and exclude professional services.\n Turning to expenses. Our total operating expenses were $239 million this quarter versus $221 million in the prior year. Our current expenses are a 4% increase over the prior quarter. As we indicated last quarter, we maintained focus on investments to accelerate development of the FICO platform, and that incremental investment is relatively modest and built into our guidance.\n Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G schedule, was 53% for the quarter, and that represents a 400 basis point increase from the same quarter last year.\n GAAP net income this quarter was $130 million, up 28% from the prior year's quarter. Our non-GAAP net income was $154 million for the quarter, up 27% in the prior year's quarter.\n The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25%. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate is expected to be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. And as a reminder, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items that were recognized.\n Free cash flow for the quarter was $61.6 million, a 30% decrease from the prior year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was 457% -- $457 million compared to $494 million in the prior quarter. We do expect free cash flow to accelerate from the Q2 level in the next 2 quarters.\n At the end of the quarter, we had $177 million in cash and marketable investments.\n Our total debt at quarter end was $2.04 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, [ 63% ] of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating rate debt is prepayable at any time, giving us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating rate debt balances in future periods.\n In terms of return of capital, we did buy back 144,000 shares in the second quarter at an average price of $1,246 per share. And at the end of the quarter, we still had $367 million remaining on the Board authorization.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his thoughts on the rest of the year and to give the information on our increase in the full year guidance. And Manav, I would just say we had a really difficult comp this quarter, too. Second quarter last year, the platform grew 60%. So we're growing more than 30% off of a pretty big number. It was a big step up last year in the second quarter. Yes. I mean you know how we guide. We're pretty conservative. We don't -- we're not banking on things getting better anytime soon. I mean I think even when we gave guidance last year, people at that point we're talking about 6 rate cuts in the year, and we weren't anticipating that.\n So the way we look at the guidance, and mortgage, obviously, being such a big piece of that, is that we don't expect things to get better in our fiscal year. And if they do, great, but it's hard for us to depend on that because obviously, the rates are going to be higher longer than anybody thought. So that's kind of how we look at that. So when they do come down, we'll enjoy that benefit, but we don't try to put a time line on that. Yes. So we had -- we said we had FICO World this quarter. So there's -- that's a pretty significant expense for us. So you'll see an increase in our Q3 spending by a little bit that's associated with that. And then the fourth quarter would probably be relatively flat to that or maybe even down a little bit. But we don't expect any significant uptick in expenses for the rest of the year. Really, it's basically due to the FICO World being held this quarter. So I mean we're focused -- we're cloud-first, right? So we really are focused in the cloud. But if our customers want to run it on-prem, we'll sell it to them that way there. But I would expect that the on-prem piece is probably not going to grow a lot, but it's probably not going to shrink a lot either because a lot of those are deeply embedded, and it's going to take years to move it to the cloud. It's a little apples and oranges. So this is just the originations piece. I mean our card in total is not down that much because we have a lot of the [ prescreen and ] account management. So the scores are not down that -- this is just the origination subset of that. There's very low pricing in it. So it's probably when you take all that into consideration, I think it's hard to compare our numbers actually across the board of what the bureau has put out.\n But things like card, every bureau has a different subset of banks -- subset of what we have. So there could be a lot of different things happening at different banks. So this is just on the originations piece. Yes, it's hard to do that, George. I mean you can kind of back into it a little bit by looking at the ARR versus the NRR, but we don't have the detail to talk about use cases versus usage. Well, I mean, it's -- I mean we're trying to get as much business as we can land in. But a lot of -- it's a lot easier to expand. Once it's in, they find their own use cases a lot of times. So a lot of our growth is coming from expansion because a lot of the initial use cases are really small. They're coming in at a very small amount, and they're expanding off of that. Yes. So the net retention rate on the nonplatform is probably going to dip below 100% at some point. These are legacy products that at some point are going to shift over to the platform. So that's been running probably just slightly above 100% and will probably be there for a while, but it could dip below 100% at some point.\n The net retention rate on the platform, it's been very strong as long as we've been reporting it. So it can vary, obviously, quarter-to-quarter, and there's no real trend to it. You've seen some quarters, it's been as low as in the hundred and teens and some quarters, it's been as high as 140-plus. But we do see continually that all the customers on the platform, almost without fail, use more the following year than they used the previous year. So there's still a lot of room to expand on that, and we think that's going to last for quite a while."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and thanks, everyone, for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlights slides that we'll be referencing during our presentation today.\n Today, I'll talk about this quarter's results and our increased guidance for the full fiscal year. We again delivered strong results, demonstrating the resiliency of our business with solid growth both in Scores and in Software.\n As shown on Page 2 of the second quarter financial highlights, we reported Q2 revenues of $434 million, up 14% over the last year. We delivered $130 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 28%. We delivered GAAP earnings of $5.16 per share, up 29% from the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, Q2 net income was $154 million with earnings of $6.14 per share, up 27% and 29%, respectively. We delivered free cash flow of $62 million in our second quarter and $182 million in the first half of fiscal '24.\n We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In Q2, we repurchased 144,000 shares at an average price of $1,246 per share. We have $367 million remaining on our Board repurchase authorization.\n Now in our Scores segment, on Page 6 of the presentation, our second quarter revenues were $237 million, up 19% versus the prior year. In B2B, the current quarter revenues were up 28% versus the prior year. On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 4% versus the prior year.\n Second quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 85% versus the prior year. Mortgage origination revenue accounted for 46% of B2B revenue and 36% of total Scores revenue. Auto originations revenues were down 1%, while credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 9% versus the prior year.\n We continue to drive strong adoption for FICO Score 10 T for nonconforming mortgages. Since 2023, clients with over $100 billion in annualized mortgage originations and about $300 billion in eligible mortgage portfolio servicing have signed up for the FICO Score 10 T. FICO 10 T for conforming mortgages will be rolled out based on the time line of the FHFA.\n In our Software business, we delivered $197 million in Q2 revenue, up 8% from last year, driven by growth in on-premises and SaaS software, partially offset by a decline in professional services. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage.\n As shown on Page 7, total ARR was up 14%, with platform ARR growing 32% and nonplatform ARR growing 8%.\n Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 112%. Platform NRR was 126%, and nonplatform NRR was 106%.\n Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $17 million. Our pipeline remains strong, especially with platform offerings.\n Before I turn it over to Steve to talk about financial detail, I'd like to take a few moments to talk about the FICO World event we hosted last year -- last week. The 4-day event included 1,200 attendees, representing more than 400 companies from 60 countries. FICO World brought together customers and prospective customers from around the globe to discuss the benefits of making real-time decisions at scale through the power of the FICO platform.\n Current customers explained the benefits of improved profits, increased customer acquisition and retention, reduced costs, growth in new product offerings and improved employee efficiency. Through FICO platform demonstrations in our innovation center, customers experienced real examples of the variety of use cases that can be deployed using the FICO platform.\n At FICO World, we announced several innovations. We responded to market demand with an open API framework, a FICO marketplace open ecosystem and business composability. Together, these innovations foster a more collaborative environment by reducing silos and creating transparency into future outcomes.\n Some of the content from FICO World will be available in the coming weeks on our YouTube channel. I'd encourage all of you to view the demonstrations and presentations to better understand our customers' excitement around this innovative technology.\n I'll talk about our outlook for the balance of the year, including our increased guidance, but first, let me turn it to Steve for further details. Thank you, Steve. Our strategy remains consistent despite an uncertain macroeconomic environment. We're experiencing strong growth in our Scores business, even as the current rate environment has driven volumes lower.\n Throughout our business, we continue to invest in innovation. This is particularly evident as we see growing customer adoption and expanded use cases of FICO platform. Our customers are delighted to be able to optimize interactions with their end customers through data-driven, composable solutions that are executed in real time.\n I'm pleased to report that today, we're raising our full year guidance as we enter the second half of our fiscal year. We're raising our full year revenue guidance to $1.69 billion. GAAP net income is now expected to be $495 million, with GAAP earnings per share of $19.70. Non-GAAP net income is now expected to be $573 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $22.80.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave to open the Q&A session. Yes, absolutely. So as you know, we had many, many quarters of over 50% growth in the platform, and then we had slowed to the 40s, and now we're in the 30s. And I think that's a reasonable and sustainable level for the foreseeable future. I think we had always anticipated some level of slowing just because as that number gets bigger, that was inevitable. And I think that's really all it is.\n We're not seeing anything that's caused for any kind of concern or alarm. Our customers are buying the platform. They're expanding the use cases once they've got the platform in. There's a little bit of timing issues around various deals but I don't think anything really significant. I guess it's probably worth pointing out that the second half of the year is always bigger than the first half. And so there's more to come this year. Well, as we've discussed in the past, we're catching up from 30 years of frozen pricing. And so our putting through price increases in this space is really a matter of trying to close the gap on the value that we provide relative to what we charge.\n The way we think about criticism, because you're right, every once in a while, there is noise about price increases. The way we think about it is transparency is our friend. And so we have increasingly been willing and interested to share exactly what our pricing is because it's such a small part of the overall bundle.\n So if the concern, whether it's from Congress or regulators or third-party groups, is about the level of expense associated with the FICO mortgage score, it's important for everyone to understand that we're talking about single-digit dollars in a bundle that cost a consumer about $6,000. So we point out the gigantic gap between what we charge and the bundle in which we reside. And we think that, that's the way to do it. We think transparency is our friend. I don't know that we've really adjusted our expectations. I think that what we're seeing is kind of in line with what we did expect, and it is a function of the macro environment. As we pointed out, we're down a little bit in auto and a little bit more in credit card and other. But I don't think it's any kind of surprise given the macro environment. So I think that it's fair to put some of the explanation on macro environment because what we're not seeing is losses to competition. What we are seeing is projects deferred or taking a little bit longer. And so I think it's very fair to attribute some of that to the macro environment. So as you know, the nonplatform business is very mature and we're deeply embedded, and yet our customers often prefer to renew and renew and renew. And so there's a cycle of multiple renewals typically associated with our licensed software and with our legacy and nonplatform software.\n Our philosophy is to not push the limits on pricing there. The customers are the same customers who are buying platform from us and customers that we'll have a relationship with for the next 20 or 30 years. And so it's not about harvesting and gouging. We raise our prices to cover costs of adding features and functionality and cybersecurity and keeping the product current. But we're not really pushing the limits of what could be done on price there and don't really intend to. We remain as committed to buyback as we have ever been. And it is our intent to continue to spend at least our free cash flow and often in excess of our free cash flow on buyback every year. And I don't expect that would change. Our leverage has slipped a bit as our earnings have gone up. And I guess that's a happy bonus of being more profitable. And in the fullness of time, you'll see that reflected in increased buyback. I think it's a reasonable range to anticipate going forward. We love our professional services, and yet we're not a professional services company, first and foremost, we're a software company. And so our goal with professional services is to provide enough PS to manage quality installs and keep our customers happy.\n We're also delighted to have partners do the installation from us, and we're bringing out partners to do some of that work. I don't imagine that our PS will shrink much more than it already has. As you know, it's come down quite a bit. And we're probably pretty close to -- I think we're at kind of a base level that it would be hard to imagine going below. About the on-prem software? So depending on how you count it, we're in about 130 of the top 300 financial institutions globally. And of that, I'd say, 40% or so are on their first use case, maybe a little bit more than that. I would say most of them have landed in the last year. I mean there's -- the very typical path for the single use case is to eventually move to multiple use cases. And so the ones that are still on one are typically the most recent. Well, as we've talked about in the past, we take the entire portfolio of Scores every year, and we evaluate it from top to bottom, thinking through what is the elasticity of demand for that particular kind of a score and where should the Scores prices move by CPI and not more than that and where should they move more than that. And so you're going to see variation in the portfolio always. I would never expect for us to raise prices the same amount across all scores. So yes, you could continue to expect them to be different. And you're on the right question. I think whether it's today or next quarter or the quarter after that, expand will exceed land sooner or later. That's inevitable, that's anticipated, that's coming. I don't think we're quite at the tipping point yet. I think land probably still exceeds expand, but I'm not sure. The kind of the key expense, I would say growth. I would -- growth is probably the wrong word. I think we're happy with kind of the expense rates that we have. And if anything, they'll go down over time. But the places where we're spending that money from an R&D standpoint are on the product, on the ecosystem and the marketplace and that side of the house.\n And then I think we also have to think a lot about broadening our distribution because as you know, we have very limited direct distribution, and we have a reasonably nascent indirect partner distribution channel. So there will be more investment on both direct and indirect sales in coming years."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Thursday, January 25, 2024. \n It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to David Singleton. Please go ahead. \nDave Singleton: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining FICO's first quarter earnings call. I'm Dave Singleton, Vice President of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by our CEO, Will Lansing; and our CFO, Steve Weber.\n Today, we issued a press release that describes financial results compared to the prior year. And on this call, management will also discuss results in comparison with the prior quarter to facilitate an understanding of the run rate of the business.\n Certain statements made in this presentation are forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Those statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. \n Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's filings with the SEC, particularly in the Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements portion of such filings. Copies are available from the SEC, from the FICO website or from our Investor Relations team.\n  This call will also include statements regarding certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the company's earnings release and Regulation G Schedule issued today for a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The earnings release and Regulation G Schedule are available on the Investor Relations page of the company's website at fico.com or on the SEC's website at sec.gov. \n And a replay of this webcast will be available through January 25, 2025.\n Now I will turn the call over to our CEO, Will Lansing. \nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlight slides that we'll be referencing during our talk today.\n I am so pleased to report that we had a great start to our fiscal year with double-digit growth in revenue, net income and EPS versus last year. It was a solid quarter, and we're well positioned for our fiscal 2024.\n As shown on Page 2 of the first quarter financial highlights, we reported first quarter revenues of $382 million, up 11% over last year; we delivered $121 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 24%; and GAAP earnings of $4.80 per share, up 25% from the prior year. \n On a non-GAAP basis, quarter 1 net income was $121 million, with earnings of $4.81 per share, up 12% and 13%, respectively.\n We delivered free cash flow of $121 million in our first quarter, up 32% versus prior year. \n We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In quarter 1, we repurchased 78,000 shares at an average price of $915 per share. This month, we exhausted the remainder of the 2022 repurchase authorization, and we announced a new $500 million authorization this week.\n In our Scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our first quarter revenues were $192 million, up 8% versus the prior year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 12% versus the prior year. This is a strong result considering the impact of higher interest rates on loan origination volumes and also the Latin America license renewal that we had in Q1 of 2023.\n On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 3% versus the prior year. First quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 188% versus the prior year. Auto originations were down 3%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 5% versus the prior year.\n We continue to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. As you'll recall, last quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage was an early adopter of FICO 10 T. This quarter, we announced that CrossCountry Mortgage, which is the nation's #3 retail mortgage lender, will use FICO 10 T to analyze its nonconforming loans. They are the first lender of originating loans to be issued in a mortgage-backed security based exclusively on the FICO Score 10 T. These clients, in addition to others, have signed up to demonstrate to investors and to rating agencies and to other stakeholders a real-world example of the improved predictive performance offered by FICO Score 10 T.\n In our Software segment, we delivered $190 million in quarter 1 revenue, up 14% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage. As you can see on Page 7, total ARR was up 18% with platform ARR growth -- growing 43% and nonplatform ARR growing 11%. \n Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 114%, with platform NRR at 136% and nonplatform NRR at 108%.\n We do continue to see strong demand from our new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $18 million, a good result after a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities, particularly with FICO Platform offerings. \n We've expanded our FICO Platform reach both by geography and by customer type. In December, we launched FICO Platform with an event in India, and we've already had several early adopters looking to expand to multiple use cases. In the U.K., StepChange Debt Charity, a market leader, will use the FICO Platform to provide individual outcomes to consumers seeking to become debt-free. \n Our biggest opportunity near term continues to be in North America, where banks are focused on digital transformation and understand the value of the FICO Platform, where data-driven analytics allow hyper-personalized decisioning and consumer interactions on a real-time basis. \n We continue to innovate and bring new capabilities to the FICO Platform and work with new customers to demonstrate value and with existing customers to expand use cases. Our innovation will be highlighted at this year's FICO World event, which will take place in San Diego in April. I'll have more on that later. But for now, let me turn the call over to Steve for further financial details. \nSteven Weber: Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $382 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, or 12% when adjusted for last year's divestiture. \n Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $192 million, up 8% from Q1 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 12% driven by mortgage originations revenues. Our growth would have been higher if not for the Latin American license revenue, which we'll talk about, in Q1 of 2023 that did not recur this year.\n Our B2C revenues were down 3% versus the prior year due to declines in our myFICO business, partially offset by our licensed B2C business. \n Scores (sic) [ Software ] segment revenues in the first quarter were $190 million, up 14% versus Q1 of 2023 or 17% when adjusted for the divestiture. This quarter, 83% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 7%. Our total Software ARR was $688 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. \n Platform ARR was $190 million, representing 28% of our total Q1 '24 ARR, up from 23% of total Q1 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 43% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 11% to $497 million this quarter. \n Our Platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% versus 110% last year. Platform NRR was 136% versus 130% in the prior year, while our nonplatform NRR was 108% versus 103% in the prior year. Nonplatform ARR growth was driven by customers' increased usage and CPI price increases.\n Our Software ACV bookings for the quarter were $18.3 million versus $21.5 million in the prior year. We view this as a successful sales quarter coming off a record quarter in our fourth quarter of '23. Remember that ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.\n Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $231 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year. Our current quarter expenses are a 3% increase from the prior quarter, which was $224 million. As we indicated last quarter, we maintain our focus on investment to accelerate development and distribution of the FICO Platform. And as a reminder, our incremental investment is relatively modest and is already built into our guidance.\n Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G Schedule, was 48% for the quarter.\n GAAP net income this quarter was $121 million, up 24% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusting for excess tax benefit and the prior year Siron divestiture, our one -- year-over-year GAAP net income grew 14%. Our non-GAAP net income was $121 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year's quarter.\n The effective tax rate for the quarter was 7% and included $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. In the prior year, the excess tax benefit was $10 million. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate will be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items.\n Free cash flow for the quarter was $121 million, a 32% increase on the previous year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was $494 million compared to $465 million in the prior year. \n At the end of the quarter, we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 66% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods.\n Turning to return of capital. We bought back 78,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $915 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 million remaining on the Board authorization, and as Will mentioned, we subsequently bought additional shares in January, exhausting the authorization. And this week, we announced a new $500 million repurchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his final thoughts. \nWilliam Lansing: Thanks, Steve. I am excited about our traction as we continue to drive more innovation than ever. In the Scores business, our financial inclusion efforts continue as we launched a FICO Score aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees displaced through the war have access to credit.\n Additionally, we added our third historically Black college and university, Delaware State University, as part of our FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.\n In the Software business, we added 20 new enhancements to the FICO Platform and expanded our patent footprint to over 220 patents by adding 10 patents related to digital decisioning, fraud detection, machine learning and responsible AI. And this innovation will be on display at FICO World 2024, where we will showcase how FICO truly supercharges our clients' digital transformations. At this 4-day event, which takes place in April, we'll bring together industry professionals from around the world to connect, share best practices and learn how FICO enables organizations to power customer connections at scale. We will highlight successful clients and demonstrate the power of the FICO Platform, enabling companies to operationalize analytics, become more composable and make better decisions at scale.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session. \nDave Singleton: Thanks, Will. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions. Operator, please open the lines. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank. \nFaiza Alwy: So I first wanted to ask about Software. You touched on this a little bit, but give us a bit more color on the Software pipeline. As you said, you do have FICO World coming up. So what are some of the new things that we should watch for? \n And as part of that, if you can address some seasonality in the business because we had a bit of a step-down in ARR, so talk a bit about what your expectations are for ARR as we move through the year. Is the step-down more seasonal? Or should we expect sort of more of a structural slowdown? \nWilliam Lansing: Yes. I think it's not so much -- well, just to take this in reverse order, not really a seasonal thing so much as it is deals move around, and they move from quarter-to-quarter. And I would say, this quarter, some deals were pushed to next quarter. We don't see that as a very big deal, I mean, not something that we're focused on.\n The pipeline is the strongest it has ever been, and it's also the most mature it's ever been. So I would say, in terms of the stages of the pipeline, we're seeing more maturity within the pipeline than we have in years past. So we're actually feeling really good about the pipeline.\n In terms of what to expect at FICO World, I think that you'll have what we traditionally do, which is take you through the latest and greatest in innovation from FICO. We're also going to see a lot of customers who are delighted to stand up in front of their peers and explain all the value that they're getting out of the FICO Platform. So I think you'll see just a lot of reference customers.\n And part of FICO World, it's not just a sales event for us. It's really an event for our customers to help sell to one another because they wind up being our best references. And so it's a place where best practices get passed around, and there's a lot of adoption of FICO technology there. \nFaiza Alwy: Great. And then just switching on the Scores side. I wonder if anything has changed as it relates to your volume expectations for 2024. There has been -- since we -- since you last reported earnings and gave the guide, it seems like the overall environment might be trending a little bit better. There's at least some more optimism. So I'm curious if anything was different as it relates to your expectations in the quarter itself and how you're thinking about volumes going forward. \nWilliam Lansing: So we're very comfortable with our guidance, and we continue to see volumes roughly where we expected, frankly. I'm not sure I agree with the view that there's more optimism. I mean rates have ticked up in mortgages recently, and so, if anything, I guess, I feel like the rate -- the fall in rates might be slower than a lot of industry pundits had been forecasting.\n That said, as you know, FICO is always very conservative in our view about these things. And so I wouldn't say that we're caught in any way by a little uptick in rates or by slowness in rates coming down. There's no question that we will benefit tremendously as volumes increase when rates come down. And we anticipate that within the year and within next year. But I'd say, right now, no change in our outlook. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Surinder Thind with Jefferies. \nSurinder Thind: So Will, just another follow-up question on the Software business. Can you talk a little bit about, I guess, the pipeline when it comes to kind of new clients? When I do the math, it looks like the pace at which new clients are bringing on ARR has been slowing for a number of quarters now. Just any color on your ability to bring on board new clients at this point? \nWilliam Lansing: We have not had any challenges bringing on new clients. I mean as our penetration goes up, we will have captured more and more of our target enterprise customer base, and more and more of the growth will be from the expand part of the business, which is more use cases and more volume with existing customers.\n It does take some time to onboard, so it doesn't always show up instantly. But I would -- I think what you're going to see over time is a mix shift from land to expand, although we're not having any trouble landing; we continue to land new customers. \nSteven Weber: Yes. I would just say, Surinder, that when we start with someone that's really new, the lead time is longer on them than an existing customer. So that's why you'll see some of that. But we still signed a lot of new deals with a lot of new customers or at least different use cases with customers that are using some of our legacy products. \nSurinder Thind: Got it. And then in terms of just the color around the margins in the Software business at this point. When I kind of go through the numbers, sounds like you've built in all of the -- what you kind of need for this year in terms of your guide. So does that mean that incremental revenue, should they show up, generally will drop to the bottom line? Or how should we think about things like that? \nWilliam Lansing: Yes. That's a great question. I think, in general, that's a fair statement. We're pretty comfortable with where the margins are, and our expenses are running in line with what we expect and what we forecast and what we planned for. And so what you said is largely right. Incremental revenue should fall through to the bottom line.\n That said, as incremental revenue comes in, we do reevaluate whether we want to devote some portion of that to additional resource for more rapid development. So will 100% of it fall to the bottom line? I don't know. We'll see. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik with Barclays. \nManav Patnaik: Steve, maybe just to follow up on that, if you could help with the Software kind of cadence around the operating expense. Looks like it ticked up sequentially, maybe a little bit higher than we thought. But since everything is running in line, can you just walk us through how we should think about the expense spend there? \nSteven Weber: Yes. So I mean we talked about that a little bit last quarter that we're making some investments. There's a lot of growth here, and we think there's a lot more room for growth. And we're doing some investment on the R&D side to add more functionality. And we're doing some investment on cybersecurity as well. So there is some investment coming in there. There's a lot of different moving parts this quarter because you've got -- we had the end of the year bonuses that happened too, so that rolls in here as well.\n So you'll probably continue to see the expenses trend up through the year as we bring more people on. We have about 100 more people today than we had a year ago, right? So we're investing, like we said, in those specific areas. So -- but you'll see the expenses throughout the year trend up but not really all that dramatically. \nManav Patnaik: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Will, just in terms of the lending commentary, I mean, I think we all have our views on mortgage, so let's put that aside for a second. But can you just walk us through what's going on in auto and card with both those down 3% and 5%? Just anything to call out there and what the outlook for '24 is really for those 2 categories? \nWilliam Lansing: I don't have a lot of additional to add there. I mean it's down a little bit and again, not a gigantic surprise to us. I think we're very kind of comfortable with that. It's within our kind of range of forecast, so not -- we wouldn't consider it a big surprise. And in terms of guessing about the future, honestly, Manav, your guess is as good as ours. We're -- as you know, we're a trailing indicator. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Kyle Peterson with Needham. \nKyle Peterson: Wanted to continue on the expenses and kind of what you guys saw this quarter. I guess, in terms of mix of revenue, it looks like there's a lower amount of professional services, which usually would think of as kind of a bit of a drag on expenses. So I just want to see how we should think about the relationship between services revenue in some of these buckets versus the expense growth. Like is there any lag? Or how should we think about some of the puts and takes there? \nSteven Weber: No. I mean so the professional services piece is a little bit unique because most of the PS work is done by internal resources. So in some cases, if they're not working on billable deals, they're working on R&D. In some cases, we've moved people into that function as well. So those costs don't necessarily go away.\n The professional services piece for us really is most of it's implementation work that we do on the Software side. So we don't really look at that necessarily as a profit center. But in terms of as an indicator of potential expenses, I think the PS tends to run in that $20 million to $25 million range. It was a little bit lower this quarter, but it's never going to be a lot higher because we're really -- we're kind of downplaying that aspect. And we don't have as many resources in PS as we've had in past years. So I don't think you're ever going to see that really tick up or really have much of a material impact on the overall margin of the business. \nKyle Peterson: Maybe just to follow up on the guidance methodology, particularly on the Scores side. Things looks like -- it sounds like your overall revenue top line is pretty much unchanged, and the volume assumptions seem the same. So I guess could you just confirm on the pricing assumptions and kind of maybe what actions you guys have taken on that front? And if everything that went into effect on the 1st of the year is in the guidance or if there's still kind of a wait-and-see approach with volumes? \nSteven Weber: Well, I mean, there's still a lot of -- obviously a lot of volatility around the volume. So I think next quarter, yes, all the pricing went into effect in first part of January. We'll have a lot more color that we can provide next quarter because we'll see the impacts of all that. We'll see how -- we'll be that much farther into the year, and we'll know a lot more about what volumes look like. And frankly, we'll know a lot more about what the rate environment looks like probably in 3 months. So we'll be able to provide more color for the rest of the year at that point. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of George Tong with Goldman Sachs. \nKeen Fai Tong: You've announced removing tiered pricing increases for mortgage scores this year. Can you talk a little bit about your pricing strategy for autos and credit cards and how pricing trends in these categories will likely compare with last year? \nWilliam Lansing: So we have adjusted price -- you identified, you highlighted probably the biggest change in pricing this year, which was collapsing the tiers in mortgage. And that was really in response to a lot of feedback from the industry about a level playing field, and so we accommodated that.\n In terms of the others, we -- as you know, we adjust prices in every segment every year, and it's relatively surgical. We go pocket by pocket and think through what we can do. Virtually, all of our scores have some level of CPI inflation pricing adjustment. And then others get some additional beyond that where we consider it appropriate. I'd say that we did not take very significant actions in auto and card, not worth calling out separately and beyond kind of cost-of-living adjustment this year. \nKeen Fai Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And can you provide a little bit of detail around some of the real-time trends that you're seeing with mortgage inquiries and some of the real-time trends that you're seeing with card volumes and auto volumes? \nWilliam Lansing: With mortgage, I'd say the surprise is that we're seeing a little bit of refi activity. It doesn't take very much for people to come back in the market and try to refinance their mortgages. And so even a point of decline is enough to generate some volume that we didn't really anticipate.\n Steve, maybe you want to comment on the other. \nSteven Weber: Yes. I mean in terms of real time, frankly, most of the reporting we get is in arrears to some degree, so the numbers you can get from industry analysts are going to be much more real time than what we can provide. There's a lot of industry data that's provided on a weekly basis. That's going to be much more real time than what we'll be able to give you. \nKeen Fai Tong: And are any -- what about some of the arrears numbers that you're seeing with cards and autos? \nSteven Weber: Well, I think like card was running a lot hotter last year, right? I mean coming out of -- when the refi slowed down, although there was a big pickup in card, and we're still seeing that kind of slowdown then about a year ago now. So it's pretty steady. I think there's been a lot of pullback on the subprime markets. But overall, it's not all that materially different. The volumes are not. They'll fluctuate a little bit depending on even what some of the bigger players might do in any one given quarter. But again, that's not -- that's probably not as across the board as mortgage, which is more driven by consumer demand that's tied to interest rates. \nKeen Fai Tong: Great. And commentary on autos? \nSteven Weber: Autos, I mean, autos is relatively stable and has been through that. I mean it's a few percent here or there, but you don't see a lot of volatility in the auto market, at least on the lending side. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question is from the line of Seth Weber with Wells Fargo Securities. \nSeth Weber: I wanted to ask, just to go back to the comment about some deals getting pushed to the second quarter, is there anything idiosyncratic that you'd call out there? Or is there any focus on any certain product -- customer categories or regions or anything that you'd attribute that to? Or are you just seeing an elongation of the sales cycle? Because I think, in prior quarters, you guys had talked about a shortening of the sales cycle. So I'm just trying to understand if there's any kind of bigger change that's going on here. \nWilliam Lansing: No, not really. I mean the sales cycle is roughly where it's been lately, which is shorter than where it was a year or 2 years ago. I would say that -- and really I mean just there's nothing special there. The -- we -- it's probably worth reiterating that FICO, unlike a lot of other software companies, doesn't do a lot of wheeling and dealing at the end of the quarter to pull in business, and it is cultural with us.\n Our salespeople and all of our employees really live, act, believe in our #1 corporate value, which is act like an owner. We are really truly aligned with shareholders. We think about it as a family business. And that includes the salespeople at end of quarter. And that's not to say that we don't make a push at the end of the quarter to close business. Obviously, we do like everyone.\n But what's not on the table is a bunch of extra discounting and Hail Mary-type stuff just to pull something in a week earlier. I mean we just don't care. And you'll never find FICO making radical concessions at quarter end to prop up a quarterly number. It's just not who we are.\n And so it's just worth keeping that in mind. So when we say deals move from quarter-to-quarter, it has more to do with the client and their budget time line and their approval process than it has to do with anything else. \nSteven Weber: Yes. And I would just say, practically, we had some deals that we didn't sign that last week of December just because it was hard to get people, right? I mean you run into this issue every December that you might have people that are out on vacation or traveling. You just can't get the ink on the paper. So some of these deals have actually closed in January.\n So I don't -- again, from Will's point -- it's a great point. We're not scrambling trying to do everything humanly possible to get the deal signed in the last week of December as opposed to the first week of January. \nSeth Weber: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just can you -- just expanding on that a little bit, can you just update us on any traction that you're seeing, whatever traction you're seeing kind of outside the financial services area for the Platform business and whether you're seeing bigger uptake there from nontraditional customers? \nWilliam Lansing: Yes. I would say that our Platform business is still very much focused on financial services. The business we do outside financial services today, we do closely aligned stuff like insurance. We do that. But in terms of really nonfinancial services verticals, I would say the lion's share of that is in the optimization area, where we have the world's leading optimization engine. And so it's used by airlines and retailers and all kinds of -- sports scheduling and all kinds of places that are not as typical when you think of FICO.\n That said, our strategy around nonfinancial services is very much to go there through partners. We have a really robust and growing and ever-stronger indirect sales force where our partners focus on both geography, and geographies where we're not so present and on -- partners and geographies where we're not present and then on verticals where we're not as represented.\n And I think you'll see, as our strategy evolves -- and you've heard us talk about building an open ecosystem for -- with the decisioning platform available to any B2C company interested in using it. That's happening this year. I mean we will have open APIs this year. We will have software development kits for ISVs and retailers and VARs and those who want to take our decisioning solutions to other verticals. So you'll see that starting to happen this year. But that's really our strategy, is to do that through partners. There's not much of that that we do directly. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. \nAshish Sabadra: Just a quick question on the mortgage volume. Did you provide what the mortgage volume growth was in the first quarter of '24? \nSteven Weber: No, we just talked about the revenues. We don't pull out the different components in terms of the volumes. But I mean you can get the volumes from other third-party sources pretty easily. \nAshish Sabadra: No, that's helpful. And then maybe on the headwind from the Lat Am license revenue, can you just remind us how much was that revenue in the prior year, 1Q '23? Or how should we think about the growth in the business excluding that onetime headwind? And then as we go through the rest of the year, just curious if there's any other license renewal headwind to be cognizant of. \nSteven Weber: There's potentially license -- I mean the renewals are hard to project, frankly, because we don't know when they're going to renew or sometimes, they'll renew early. Sometimes they will renew later if they'll -- taking on additional pieces. So the renewal piece is [ still gummy ].\n If you look at the next couple of quarters, we had some pretty big point-in-time revenue last year in Q2 and Q3. So we may not have that again this year. Sometimes we have renewals that end up moving to the platform, and they end up becoming ratable revenues. So they don't have up-front license revenue.\n So we're actively trying to move people, obviously, to the platform, which we forego the up-front license revenue in favor of recurring revenue. So as those happen, you're going to see changes there. That's typical to companies that are moving to ratable revenue, but it's been less dramatic for us as we've done over time. But there's always the potential that you're going to see that, and you'll have to think about that as different quarters come up. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Meuler with Baird. \nJeffrey Meuler: I didn't understand the answer on the last question. The Lat Am renewal in the year ago, that was in Scores, not Software, correct? \nSteven Weber: Yes, that was in Scores. I'm sorry. That was in Scores. And the ones in Scores happen occasionally. We'll have license deals. Typically, they're foreign deals in areas where a large bank wants to build their own score model, and we'll sign deals with them. So that -- within Scores, we occasionally have those, and it's difficult to -- again, even with those, it's difficult to know what the timing is going to be. \nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then just trying to -- I guess, probably the last question as well, like the 21% growth in B2B Scores last quarter, 12% growth this quarter. How much of that slowdown is just due to the Lat Am comp in the year ago? Or anything else that you can say on like non-origination revenue trends? Because it doesn't look like a lot of [ slowing really ]. \nSteven Weber: Yes, it's primarily -- it's completely due to Lat Am and lower mortgage volumes in Q1 versus Q4, right? I mean that's -- we're volume takers, obviously, right? I mean if the volumes are down, which they're going to be -- they're going to be anyway seasonally in that quarter. The December quarter has fewer mortgages typically than the September quarter does. So it's the combination of those 2 things. Outside of originations, it was up slightly. The non-origination business was up slightly but not all that significant. \nJeffrey Meuler: Okay. And then can you just help me with like any rough order of magnitude of sizing? If I look at mortgage -- your mortgage origination revenue, roughly how much of it comes from closed loans versus things like rate shopping or applications that don't result in a closed loan or anything else that would like fall in that bucket? \nSteven Weber: Yes. Frankly, we don't know because we don't -- I mean, actually, I think if you asked the bureaus, they'll tell you the same thing. The bundles get pulled for -- with scores and data, and they don't necessarily know -- nobody necessarily knows. If ever, the actual lender knows if it was closed or not. So we don't really know whether they turned into a closed loan or not. That's not reported to us. \nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Rajiv Bhatia with Morningstar. \nRajiv Bhatia: Sorry if I missed it, but can you provide what percentage of your Scores revenue was mortgage in the quarter? Like I know you'd provided that in the previous quarters. \nSteven Weber: Yes. We didn't provide that. I don't have the number in front of me, what the percentage was. So I -- we don't -- we didn't -- occasionally, we will do that. We didn't provide that this quarter. So you could probably back into it if you took the numbers we gave you from last year and then the percentage increases. \nRajiv Bhatia: Okay. We can follow up I guess. And then I know we talked about like the Latin America kind of Scores license. But if I look at like the Asia Score revenue in your 10-K -- or 10-Q, it was, I think, $5.9 million and definitely more than $4.1 million for the -- for all of fiscal 2023. So I guess is that like [indiscernible]? \nSteven Weber: Yes, we had our license deal in Asia in Scores. So we had a much larger one in Latin America last year. And then we -- if you look at it in any given quarter, probably half the time, we have a license deal somewhere. But obviously, the total license deals this year were much smaller this year than they were last year. And that was because of the Latin American deal. \nOperator: And at this time, there are no more questions in the queue. I will now conclude the call. So thank you, everyone, for joining today's call. This does conclude the conference call, and we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Weber",
            "content": "Thanks, Will, and good afternoon, everyone. As Will mentioned, we had another very good quarter with total revenue of $382 million, an increase of 11% over the prior year, or 12% when adjusted for last year's divestiture. \n Scores segment revenues for the quarter were $192 million, up 8% from Q1 of 2023. B2B revenues were up 12% driven by mortgage originations revenues. Our growth would have been higher if not for the Latin American license revenue, which we'll talk about, in Q1 of 2023 that did not recur this year.\n Our B2C revenues were down 3% versus the prior year due to declines in our myFICO business, partially offset by our licensed B2C business. \n Scores (sic) [ Software ] segment revenues in the first quarter were $190 million, up 14% versus Q1 of 2023 or 17% when adjusted for the divestiture. This quarter, 83% of total company revenues were derived from our Americas region, which is a combination of our North America and Latin America regions. Our EMEA region generated 10% of revenues, and the Asia Pacific region delivered 7%. Our total Software ARR was $688 million, an 18% increase over the prior year. \n Platform ARR was $190 million, representing 28% of our total Q1 '24 ARR, up from 23% of total Q1 '23 ARR. Platform ARR grew 43% versus the prior year, while nonplatform ARR grew 11% to $497 million this quarter. \n Our Platform land-and-expand strategy continues to be very successful. Our dollar-based net retention rate in the quarter was 114% versus 110% last year. Platform NRR was 136% versus 130% in the prior year, while our nonplatform NRR was 108% versus 103% in the prior year. Nonplatform ARR growth was driven by customers' increased usage and CPI price increases.\n Our Software ACV bookings for the quarter were $18.3 million versus $21.5 million in the prior year. We view this as a successful sales quarter coming off a record quarter in our fourth quarter of '23. Remember that ACV bookings include only the annual value of software sales and exclude professional services.\n Turning now to our expenses for the quarter. Total operating expenses were $231 million this quarter versus $205 million in the prior year. Our current quarter expenses are a 3% increase from the prior quarter, which was $224 million. As we indicated last quarter, we maintain our focus on investment to accelerate development and distribution of the FICO Platform. And as a reminder, our incremental investment is relatively modest and is already built into our guidance.\n Our non-GAAP operating margin, as shown in our Reg G Schedule, was 48% for the quarter.\n GAAP net income this quarter was $121 million, up 24% from the prior year's quarter. Adjusting for excess tax benefit and the prior year Siron divestiture, our one -- year-over-year GAAP net income grew 14%. Our non-GAAP net income was $121 million for the quarter, up 12% from the prior year's quarter.\n The effective tax rate for the quarter was 7% and included $24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards. In the prior year, the excess tax benefit was $10 million. We believe that our fiscal year 2024 net effective tax rate will be around 22%, while our recurring tax rate is expected to be around 26%. Again, the recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items.\n Free cash flow for the quarter was $121 million, a 32% increase on the previous year. The trailing 12-month free cash flow was $494 million compared to $465 million in the prior year. \n At the end of the quarter, we had $197 million in cash and marketable investments. Our total debt at quarter end was $1.96 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2%. Currently, 66% of our total debt is fixed rate. Our floating debt is prepayable at any time and gives us the flexibility to use free cash flow to reduce outstanding floating debt balances in future periods.\n Turning to return of capital. We bought back 78,000 shares in the first quarter at an average price of $915 per share. At the end of the quarter, we had $49 million remaining on the Board authorization, and as Will mentioned, we subsequently bought additional shares in January, exhausting the authorization. And this week, we announced a new $500 million repurchase authorization. And we continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash.\n And with that, I'll turn it back to Will for his final thoughts. Yes. I would just say, Surinder, that when we start with someone that's really new, the lead time is longer on them than an existing customer. So that's why you'll see some of that. But we still signed a lot of new deals with a lot of new customers or at least different use cases with customers that are using some of our legacy products. Yes. So I mean we talked about that a little bit last quarter that we're making some investments. There's a lot of growth here, and we think there's a lot more room for growth. And we're doing some investment on the R&D side to add more functionality. And we're doing some investment on cybersecurity as well. So there is some investment coming in there. There's a lot of different moving parts this quarter because you've got -- we had the end of the year bonuses that happened too, so that rolls in here as well.\n So you'll probably continue to see the expenses trend up through the year as we bring more people on. We have about 100 more people today than we had a year ago, right? So we're investing, like we said, in those specific areas. So -- but you'll see the expenses throughout the year trend up but not really all that dramatically. No. I mean so the professional services piece is a little bit unique because most of the PS work is done by internal resources. So in some cases, if they're not working on billable deals, they're working on R&D. In some cases, we've moved people into that function as well. So those costs don't necessarily go away.\n The professional services piece for us really is most of it's implementation work that we do on the Software side. So we don't really look at that necessarily as a profit center. But in terms of as an indicator of potential expenses, I think the PS tends to run in that $20 million to $25 million range. It was a little bit lower this quarter, but it's never going to be a lot higher because we're really -- we're kind of downplaying that aspect. And we don't have as many resources in PS as we've had in past years. So I don't think you're ever going to see that really tick up or really have much of a material impact on the overall margin of the business. Well, I mean, there's still a lot of -- obviously a lot of volatility around the volume. So I think next quarter, yes, all the pricing went into effect in first part of January. We'll have a lot more color that we can provide next quarter because we'll see the impacts of all that. We'll see how -- we'll be that much farther into the year, and we'll know a lot more about what volumes look like. And frankly, we'll know a lot more about what the rate environment looks like probably in 3 months. So we'll be able to provide more color for the rest of the year at that point. Yes. I mean in terms of real time, frankly, most of the reporting we get is in arrears to some degree, so the numbers you can get from industry analysts are going to be much more real time than what we can provide. There's a lot of industry data that's provided on a weekly basis. That's going to be much more real time than what we'll be able to give you. Well, I think like card was running a lot hotter last year, right? I mean coming out of -- when the refi slowed down, although there was a big pickup in card, and we're still seeing that kind of slowdown then about a year ago now. So it's pretty steady. I think there's been a lot of pullback on the subprime markets. But overall, it's not all that materially different. The volumes are not. They'll fluctuate a little bit depending on even what some of the bigger players might do in any one given quarter. But again, that's not -- that's probably not as across the board as mortgage, which is more driven by consumer demand that's tied to interest rates. Autos, I mean, autos is relatively stable and has been through that. I mean it's a few percent here or there, but you don't see a lot of volatility in the auto market, at least on the lending side. Yes. And I would just say, practically, we had some deals that we didn't sign that last week of December just because it was hard to get people, right? I mean you run into this issue every December that you might have people that are out on vacation or traveling. You just can't get the ink on the paper. So some of these deals have actually closed in January.\n So I don't -- again, from Will's point -- it's a great point. We're not scrambling trying to do everything humanly possible to get the deal signed in the last week of December as opposed to the first week of January. No, we just talked about the revenues. We don't pull out the different components in terms of the volumes. But I mean you can get the volumes from other third-party sources pretty easily. There's potentially license -- I mean the renewals are hard to project, frankly, because we don't know when they're going to renew or sometimes, they'll renew early. Sometimes they will renew later if they'll -- taking on additional pieces. So the renewal piece is [ still gummy ].\n If you look at the next couple of quarters, we had some pretty big point-in-time revenue last year in Q2 and Q3. So we may not have that again this year. Sometimes we have renewals that end up moving to the platform, and they end up becoming ratable revenues. So they don't have up-front license revenue.\n So we're actively trying to move people, obviously, to the platform, which we forego the up-front license revenue in favor of recurring revenue. So as those happen, you're going to see changes there. That's typical to companies that are moving to ratable revenue, but it's been less dramatic for us as we've done over time. But there's always the potential that you're going to see that, and you'll have to think about that as different quarters come up. Yes, that was in Scores. I'm sorry. That was in Scores. And the ones in Scores happen occasionally. We'll have license deals. Typically, they're foreign deals in areas where a large bank wants to build their own score model, and we'll sign deals with them. So that -- within Scores, we occasionally have those, and it's difficult to -- again, even with those, it's difficult to know what the timing is going to be. Yes, it's primarily -- it's completely due to Lat Am and lower mortgage volumes in Q1 versus Q4, right? I mean that's -- we're volume takers, obviously, right? I mean if the volumes are down, which they're going to be -- they're going to be anyway seasonally in that quarter. The December quarter has fewer mortgages typically than the September quarter does. So it's the combination of those 2 things. Outside of originations, it was up slightly. The non-origination business was up slightly but not all that significant. Yes. Frankly, we don't know because we don't -- I mean, actually, I think if you asked the bureaus, they'll tell you the same thing. The bundles get pulled for -- with scores and data, and they don't necessarily know -- nobody necessarily knows. If ever, the actual lender knows if it was closed or not. So we don't really know whether they turned into a closed loan or not. That's not reported to us. Yes. We didn't provide that. I don't have the number in front of me, what the percentage was. So I -- we don't -- we didn't -- occasionally, we will do that. We didn't provide that this quarter. So you could probably back into it if you took the numbers we gave you from last year and then the percentage increases. Yes, we had our license deal in Asia in Scores. So we had a much larger one in Latin America last year. And then we -- if you look at it in any given quarter, probably half the time, we have a license deal somewhere. But obviously, the total license deals this year were much smaller this year than they were last year. And that was because of the Latin American deal."

            "content": "Thanks, Dave, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter earnings call. In the Investor Relations section of our website, we posted some financial highlight slides that we'll be referencing during our talk today.\n I am so pleased to report that we had a great start to our fiscal year with double-digit growth in revenue, net income and EPS versus last year. It was a solid quarter, and we're well positioned for our fiscal 2024.\n As shown on Page 2 of the first quarter financial highlights, we reported first quarter revenues of $382 million, up 11% over last year; we delivered $121 million of GAAP net income in the quarter, up 24%; and GAAP earnings of $4.80 per share, up 25% from the prior year. \n On a non-GAAP basis, quarter 1 net income was $121 million, with earnings of $4.81 per share, up 12% and 13%, respectively.\n We delivered free cash flow of $121 million in our first quarter, up 32% versus prior year. \n We continue to return capital to our shareholders through buybacks. In quarter 1, we repurchased 78,000 shares at an average price of $915 per share. This month, we exhausted the remainder of the 2022 repurchase authorization, and we announced a new $500 million authorization this week.\n In our Scores segment, as you can see from Page 6, our first quarter revenues were $192 million, up 8% versus the prior year. On the B2B side, the current quarter revenues were up 12% versus the prior year. This is a strong result considering the impact of higher interest rates on loan origination volumes and also the Latin America license renewal that we had in Q1 of 2023.\n On the B2C side, the current quarter revenues were down 3% versus the prior year. First quarter mortgage originations revenues were up 188% versus the prior year. Auto originations were down 3%. Credit card, personal loan and other originations revenues were down 5% versus the prior year.\n We continue to see traction with our latest score, FICO Score 10 T. As you'll recall, last quarter, we announced that Movement Mortgage was an early adopter of FICO 10 T. This quarter, we announced that CrossCountry Mortgage, which is the nation's #3 retail mortgage lender, will use FICO 10 T to analyze its nonconforming loans. They are the first lender of originating loans to be issued in a mortgage-backed security based exclusively on the FICO Score 10 T. These clients, in addition to others, have signed up to demonstrate to investors and to rating agencies and to other stakeholders a real-world example of the improved predictive performance offered by FICO Score 10 T.\n In our Software segment, we delivered $190 million in quarter 1 revenue, up 14% from last year. We continue to drive strong growth in ARR and NRR through our land-and-expand strategy, with expand driven by increased customer usage. As you can see on Page 7, total ARR was up 18% with platform ARR growth -- growing 43% and nonplatform ARR growing 11%. \n Total NRR for the quarter, shown on Page 8, was 114%, with platform NRR at 136% and nonplatform NRR at 108%.\n We do continue to see strong demand from our new customers. Our total ACV bookings for the quarter were $18 million, a good result after a particularly strong fourth quarter. We continue to have a robust pipeline of opportunities, particularly with FICO Platform offerings. \n We've expanded our FICO Platform reach both by geography and by customer type. In December, we launched FICO Platform with an event in India, and we've already had several early adopters looking to expand to multiple use cases. In the U.K., StepChange Debt Charity, a market leader, will use the FICO Platform to provide individual outcomes to consumers seeking to become debt-free. \n Our biggest opportunity near term continues to be in North America, where banks are focused on digital transformation and understand the value of the FICO Platform, where data-driven analytics allow hyper-personalized decisioning and consumer interactions on a real-time basis. \n We continue to innovate and bring new capabilities to the FICO Platform and work with new customers to demonstrate value and with existing customers to expand use cases. Our innovation will be highlighted at this year's FICO World event, which will take place in San Diego in April. I'll have more on that later. But for now, let me turn the call over to Steve for further financial details. Thanks, Steve. I am excited about our traction as we continue to drive more innovation than ever. In the Scores business, our financial inclusion efforts continue as we launched a FICO Score aimed at helping Ukrainian refugees displaced through the war have access to credit.\n Additionally, we added our third historically Black college and university, Delaware State University, as part of our FICO Educational Analytics Challenge. This is a program created to help promote diversity in data science, engineering and technology.\n In the Software business, we added 20 new enhancements to the FICO Platform and expanded our patent footprint to over 220 patents by adding 10 patents related to digital decisioning, fraud detection, machine learning and responsible AI. And this innovation will be on display at FICO World 2024, where we will showcase how FICO truly supercharges our clients' digital transformations. At this 4-day event, which takes place in April, we'll bring together industry professionals from around the world to connect, share best practices and learn how FICO enables organizations to power customer connections at scale. We will highlight successful clients and demonstrate the power of the FICO Platform, enabling companies to operationalize analytics, become more composable and make better decisions at scale.\n With that, I'll turn the call back to Dave, and we'll open up the Q&A session. Yes. I think it's not so much -- well, just to take this in reverse order, not really a seasonal thing so much as it is deals move around, and they move from quarter-to-quarter. And I would say, this quarter, some deals were pushed to next quarter. We don't see that as a very big deal, I mean, not something that we're focused on.\n The pipeline is the strongest it has ever been, and it's also the most mature it's ever been. So I would say, in terms of the stages of the pipeline, we're seeing more maturity within the pipeline than we have in years past. So we're actually feeling really good about the pipeline.\n In terms of what to expect at FICO World, I think that you'll have what we traditionally do, which is take you through the latest and greatest in innovation from FICO. We're also going to see a lot of customers who are delighted to stand up in front of their peers and explain all the value that they're getting out of the FICO Platform. So I think you'll see just a lot of reference customers.\n And part of FICO World, it's not just a sales event for us. It's really an event for our customers to help sell to one another because they wind up being our best references. And so it's a place where best practices get passed around, and there's a lot of adoption of FICO technology there. So we're very comfortable with our guidance, and we continue to see volumes roughly where we expected, frankly. I'm not sure I agree with the view that there's more optimism. I mean rates have ticked up in mortgages recently, and so, if anything, I guess, I feel like the rate -- the fall in rates might be slower than a lot of industry pundits had been forecasting.\n That said, as you know, FICO is always very conservative in our view about these things. And so I wouldn't say that we're caught in any way by a little uptick in rates or by slowness in rates coming down. There's no question that we will benefit tremendously as volumes increase when rates come down. And we anticipate that within the year and within next year. But I'd say, right now, no change in our outlook. We have not had any challenges bringing on new clients. I mean as our penetration goes up, we will have captured more and more of our target enterprise customer base, and more and more of the growth will be from the expand part of the business, which is more use cases and more volume with existing customers.\n It does take some time to onboard, so it doesn't always show up instantly. But I would -- I think what you're going to see over time is a mix shift from land to expand, although we're not having any trouble landing; we continue to land new customers. Yes. That's a great question. I think, in general, that's a fair statement. We're pretty comfortable with where the margins are, and our expenses are running in line with what we expect and what we forecast and what we planned for. And so what you said is largely right. Incremental revenue should fall through to the bottom line.\n That said, as incremental revenue comes in, we do reevaluate whether we want to devote some portion of that to additional resource for more rapid development. So will 100% of it fall to the bottom line? I don't know. We'll see. I don't have a lot of additional to add there. I mean it's down a little bit and again, not a gigantic surprise to us. I think we're very kind of comfortable with that. It's within our kind of range of forecast, so not -- we wouldn't consider it a big surprise. And in terms of guessing about the future, honestly, Manav, your guess is as good as ours. We're -- as you know, we're a trailing indicator. So we have adjusted price -- you identified, you highlighted probably the biggest change in pricing this year, which was collapsing the tiers in mortgage. And that was really in response to a lot of feedback from the industry about a level playing field, and so we accommodated that.\n In terms of the others, we -- as you know, we adjust prices in every segment every year, and it's relatively surgical. We go pocket by pocket and think through what we can do. Virtually, all of our scores have some level of CPI inflation pricing adjustment. And then others get some additional beyond that where we consider it appropriate. I'd say that we did not take very significant actions in auto and card, not worth calling out separately and beyond kind of cost-of-living adjustment this year. With mortgage, I'd say the surprise is that we're seeing a little bit of refi activity. It doesn't take very much for people to come back in the market and try to refinance their mortgages. And so even a point of decline is enough to generate some volume that we didn't really anticipate.\n Steve, maybe you want to comment on the other. No, not really. I mean the sales cycle is roughly where it's been lately, which is shorter than where it was a year or 2 years ago. I would say that -- and really I mean just there's nothing special there. The -- we -- it's probably worth reiterating that FICO, unlike a lot of other software companies, doesn't do a lot of wheeling and dealing at the end of the quarter to pull in business, and it is cultural with us.\n Our salespeople and all of our employees really live, act, believe in our #1 corporate value, which is act like an owner. We are really truly aligned with shareholders. We think about it as a family business. And that includes the salespeople at end of quarter. And that's not to say that we don't make a push at the end of the quarter to close business. Obviously, we do like everyone.\n But what's not on the table is a bunch of extra discounting and Hail Mary-type stuff just to pull something in a week earlier. I mean we just don't care. And you'll never find FICO making radical concessions at quarter end to prop up a quarterly number. It's just not who we are.\n And so it's just worth keeping that in mind. So when we say deals move from quarter-to-quarter, it has more to do with the client and their budget time line and their approval process than it has to do with anything else. Yes. I would say that our Platform business is still very much focused on financial services. The business we do outside financial services today, we do closely aligned stuff like insurance. We do that. But in terms of really nonfinancial services verticals, I would say the lion's share of that is in the optimization area, where we have the world's leading optimization engine. And so it's used by airlines and retailers and all kinds of -- sports scheduling and all kinds of places that are not as typical when you think of FICO.\n That said, our strategy around nonfinancial services is very much to go there through partners. We have a really robust and growing and ever-stronger indirect sales force where our partners focus on both geography, and geographies where we're not so present and on -- partners and geographies where we're not present and then on verticals where we're not as represented.\n And I think you'll see, as our strategy evolves -- and you've heard us talk about building an open ecosystem for -- with the decisioning platform available to any B2C company interested in using it. That's happening this year. I mean we will have open APIs this year. We will have software development kits for ISVs and retailers and VARs and those who want to take our decisioning solutions to other verticals. So you'll see that starting to happen this year. But that's really our strategy, is to do that through partners. There's not much of that that we do directly."
