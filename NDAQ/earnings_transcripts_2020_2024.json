After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq\u2019s fourth quarter and full-year 2020 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Accounting Officer and Incoming CFO; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that we are starting the new year at the depths of the COVID crisis and we continue to focus on maintaining our employees\u2019 health and safety while executing on our critical role in facilitating capital raising, liquidity and price discovery in the economies in which we and our clients operate. While we manage through this very challenging environment, the rollout of the vaccines provides a new hope for 2021. Throughout this health crisis, I have remained extremely proud of the resilience of Nasdaq\u2019s business, our team and our client community. Over the past year, we have deepened our partnerships with our clients and worked together with them to ensure that resiliency of the capital markets to handle unprecedented volumes and to facilitate near record levels of capital raising across our listed companies. Capital markets and the role Nasdaq plays within them have never been more important as a critical source of funding and liquidity for innovation and job creation, including vaccine research and production as well as for funding and liquidity needed to help companies weather through this very challenging period. We remained steadfast and unwavering in our commitments to our employees, our clients and our mission as we enter 2021. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq\u2019s full-year 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020 financial and business performance; the progress we have made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction and our ambitions for 2021 and beyond. Turning to our results, I am very pleased to report Nasdaq\u2019s strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020. First, for the fourth quarter, we achieved $788 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 22% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.60 rose 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the full-year of 2020, we generated total net revenues of $2.9 billion, including a 10% organic revenue growth from our Solutions segments, along with 21% organic growth, a revenue increased from our Market Services segment due primarily to elevated trading volumes in U.S. equities and options. Total organic revenue growth for the year was 14%. In terms of the annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and software-as-a-service or SaaS revenue disclosures, we introduced at our November 2020 Investor Day, ARR ended the year at $1.58 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 9% year-over-year and annualized SaaS revenue was $456 million, up 11% year-over-year. The strong development across these types of revenues creates a healthy core to build off of going forward, independent of fluctuating trade volumes or market levels. 2020 was another year of robust execution for Nasdaq against the unique operating environment that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The strong results from the fourth quarter highlights the strength of Nasdaq\u2019s diversified product offering and business model, which allowed us to address the needs of our clients in a unique capital markets environment, including periods of elevated trading volumes, rising benchmark index valuations, and a very strong period of new listings and capital formation. Throughout the year, we also continued to invest organically and inorganically to advance our offerings, guided by our strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider, while also investing to sustain the strong competitive position of our core marketplace foundation. Because of the strong performance and for the year and in particular, the very strong finish in the fourth quarter, we entered 2021 with incredible momentum. We now have begun our fourth year since the 2017 announcement of our new vision for Nasdaq. Our full-year results illustrate how we can deliver on our strategy and more importantly, how our disciplined client-centric focus is creating value not just for our clients, but for all of our stakeholders. Now, I am going to turn to specific highlights for our businesses, focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Investment Intelligence segment delivered $247 million in net revenue during the fourth quarter, a 27% increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by especially strong momentum in index licensing as well as positive contributions from both analytics and end market data. We set new quarterly highs in both our index revenues of $97 million and end of period ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes of $359 billion. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, our Investment Intelligence segment has been repositioned for improved growth as we look to deepen our engagement with asset managers, asset owners and consultants and the clients from our market data and index franchises. We are diligently focused on building out this business to be the essential partner to the investment community. As they move into 2021, we are making investments to ensure these growth engines have the fuel to continue performing in the long-term. For example, we are progressing our alternative investment workflow and data platform for asset owners with new capabilities, coupled with our integration with Globus, and we will continue to advance our expansion of our increasingly popular indexes and trusted data products to new clients and new geographies. Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $106 million in total net revenues for the fourth quarter and 8% increase from the prior year period. This is driven by higher SaaS revenues and changes in foreign exchange rates, while revenues from market infrastructure operator projects stayed - remained flat. Over the course of 2020, I am pleased to report market technology welcome 29 new customers, of which 25 chose our SaaS products. As we stated in the previous investor calls, service implementations change request projects, new order intake levels from our traditional market operator clients and funding for new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by pandemic-related factors. In the second-half of 2020, we have taken actions, in particular, dedicating more resources to mitigate project delays and to better deliver for our customers. In a communication to our investors issued on January 12, we noted in one particular project, specifically an on-premise enterprise software delivery of a complex post-trade clearing and settlement solution for an exchange group, changes to our implementation timing and expected costs resulted in a significant discrete $25 million expense for the period. The expense resulted from taking a one-time reserve to reflect the expected losses on the approximately 13-year fixed price contract. The need for a reserve resulted from an updated detailed review of the implementation project with the client and with our internal technology and finance team. We expect to increase implementation spend from higher resourcing for the project and a longer project duration due probably to the aforementioned COVID-related impacts, but also due to a prior under-appreciation of this one project\u2019s unique demands. While some of the issues are very specific to this one project, we will apply what we have learned to ensure future contracts fit with the profitability objectives of the market technology business. As we examine the broader market technology business with our market infrastructure operator clients, we are starting to see improved sales opportunities as the exit 2020. However, we have not seen a full recovery to a pre-COVID sales environment. Both new and existing market infrastructure operator clients recognize that we are operating in a unique period with unusually elongated sales cycles. But we are \u2013 they are engaging with us with incrementally more energy in the last few months to move forward with new projects and system upgrades. Additionally, our buy side and sell side technology business led by our staff base trade execution and trade surveillance offerings maintained strong momentum throughout 2020 with 13% revenue growth for the full year and we entered 2021 with a position of strength in this segment of our business. During the fourth quarter, we also announced an agreement to acquire Verafin, which provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America with a cloud-based platform to detect, investigate and report money laundering and financial fraud. Our statistics on the United Nations notes that up to $2 trillion in laundered money flows through the financial system every year as criminals continue to find sophisticated methods for moving funds undetected, robust, advanced anti-money laundering technology have become essential for financial institutions. Once closed, Verafin will compliment Nasdaq\u2019s established regtech leadership to create a global SaaS leader focused on a $13 billion market for anti-financial crime technology solutions. Our long-term mission together with Verafin is to become the market leading provider of anti-financial crime technology. Despite the challenges we faced in market technology in 2020, we remain highly confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute against new opportunities going forward. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our market services segment delivered net revenues of $291 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 29% from the prior year period. This area of our business maintained its strong competitive position across both the United States and Europe, while our U.S. options business set a new quarterly trading volume record. The record fourth quarter helped make 2020 the most active year for options trading ever averaging 27.7 million contracts traded a day, a 58% increase over 2019. Nasdaq revenue industry in multiply listed options for the 11th year in a row. In fact, for the first time, Nasdaq was the largest options marketplace platform in the country for the year, including trading both index options and multiply listed options. Meanwhile, our European Equities Exchange Complex set a new 10-year high on on-exchange market share in 2020. Finally, our corporate platform segment delivered revenue of $144 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase despite particularly strong IPO and private market activity in our listings business as well as increased demand for IR intelligence, ESG services and board portal offerings. Our team successfully adopted all elements of the IPO process to a virtual environment. And as a result, for the eighth consecutive year, Nasdaq led the United States exchanges for IPOs in 2020 with 316 capitalizing on an incredibly busy year for new issues and with a 67% overall IPO win rate, including an 83% win rate for operating companies and a 56% win rate for SPACs. Also for the second year in a row, Nasdaq ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised with $80.9 billion, representing 52% of the industry total. The fourth quarter was particularly strong in terms of activity. We welcomed 142 IPOs and this momentum has carried into 2021 with a particularly busy January. Meanwhile, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges continued to attract new companies from across Europe adding 67 new listings, including 45 IPOs in 2020. We also had 20 new companies switch their corporate listings to Nasdaq, including American Electric Power, AstraZeneca and Keurig Dr Pepper. These 20 transfers represent aggregate $282 billion in global equity market capitalization. Across the entire Nasdaq listing business in both the U.S. and the Nordics, our corporate issue account was 8% in 2020, setting us up in a strong position as we begin 2021. On the private company side, our Nasdaq private market business set a new record for annual volume in 2020, facilitating 90 private company liquidity programs and the fourth quarter was particularly busy with 49 transactions completed on the platform, a new quarterly record. Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions, particularly our ESG related technology and consultative tools, drove growth in our IR and ESG services sub-segment, which saw an 8% increase in the fourth quarter. And lastly, during the period, we filed a new U.S. listing proposal at the SEC that seeks to standardize board level diversity disclosures coupled with recommended minimum diversity standard through a have or explained framework. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, 2020 represented an important year regarding the progress we have made on our strategic journey. As we continue on that path, I would like to reiterate the core ambitions we outlined at our Investor Day in November. In market technology, our core ambition is to be the trusted market technology and anti-financial crime technology partner and our key 2021 initiatives for the segments are to deploy and drive adoption of SaaS market technology solutions and to enhance our anti-financial crime business for the combination with Verafin. In investment intelligence, our core ambition is to be the essential partner for the investment community and our key 2021 initiatives are to offer a full service alternative workflow platform for asset owners and to accelerate the expansion of indexes and cloud delivered data services to new clients and new geographies. In corporate platforms, our core ambition is to be the leading provider of capital market solutions to corporates. And our key 2021 initiatives are to expand Nasdaq\u2019s share of U.S. corporate listings and to establish the leading end-to-end corporate ESG reporting workflow tools to complement our IR and governance solutions. Lastly, in-market services, our core ambition is to be the pre-eminent market operator for equities and equity derivatives in the U.S. and Europe. And our key 2021 initiatives are to continue to implement our multi-year migration of our derivatives markets to our next generation platforms increasingly leveraging the cloud and to expand our suite of distinctive equity and equity derivative trading products and solutions. We look forward to updating on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter pretty solid results for Nasdaq completing a successful 2020 for our company. Moving forward into 2021, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and data analytics provider while maintaining segment leadership in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe. We will officially celebrate Nasdaq\u2019s 50th anniversary next month. As we near this important milestone in our corporate history, I remain confident that we are moving the company in the right direction as we build upon the strong momentum generated last year. With that, I will turn it over to Michael in a moment to review the financial details for his final earnings call before handing the mantle to Ann at the end of February. While we spend some time in our last earnings call and our Investor Day reflecting on Michael\u2019s incredible career here at Nasdaq and at PMS, on this occasion of Michael\u2019s 73rd consecutive and final earnings call. I would like to thank Michael for his tremendous service to Nasdaq. We will miss him greatly, but we are well prepared for his transition as Ann Dennison stepped into the role of CFO and Jeremy Skule expands his responsibilities to become our new Chief Strategy Officer. Now, over to you, Michael.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank you for those kind remarks, Adena and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $142 million increase in reported net revenue of $788 million is a net result of organic growth of $126 million, including a 27% organic increase in market services and a 16% organic increase in the solution segments, a $3 million dollar positive impact from acquisitions and a $13 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I start with investment intelligence revenue, which increased $53 million or 27%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 25%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and positive contributions from each of the market data and analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $560 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, revenues related to index AUM and futures trading are not included in the ARR definition. First quarter 2020 operating margin of 65% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period while the full year 2020 margin of 64% was 1 percentage point versus 2019. Now, looking forward to the first quarter of 2021 for index, trading activity of instruments licensed to our indexes achieved certain thresholds earlier in the year. That triggered an increase in licensing economics in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. While the confidentiality of our index agreements limits the detail we can provide on this, what we can say is that as we begin 2021, the economics of some of the agreements reset for the new year and this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This assumes similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. Turning to market technology, revenue increased $8 million or 8%. Organic revenue growth totaled $4 million or 4% and there was a positive $4 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was driven primarily by higher SaaS revenues. ARR was $283 million and increased 9% compared to the prior-year period. The operating margin was a negative 1% in the period and was impacted by the previously mentioned $25 million reserve related to the expected loss on the market technology implementation project. Excluding the reserve, the operating margin was 23% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 24% in the prior-year period and 16% for the full year 2020 unchanged from 2019. Corporate platforms revenues increased $15 million, or 12%. Organic revenue growth totaled $13 million or 10% and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in U.S. listings revenues, increases in ESG Services revenues and growth in Nasdaq private market. ARR was $470 million, and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating margin of 31% for this segment was down from 35% in the prior-year period. The decrease in the operating margin was primarily due to higher variable compensation and marketing expenses during the period in support of a very strong IPO activity. For the full year 2020, the corporate platforms operating margin was 36%, unchanged from 2019. Market services net revenues increased $66 million, or 29%. The organic revenue increase was $60 million or 27% and there was a $6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and U.S. equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. For the fourth quarter 2020, market services operating margin of 61%, increased 6 percentage points from 55% in the prior-year period and full year 2020 margin of 62% was 5 percentage points higher than 2019, each comparison reflecting strong operating leverage on the higher trading revenues. Now, earlier today, Nasdaq Clearing received the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority\u2019s or SFSAs decision following their supervisory review initiated after the member default following the extreme market movement on our Nordic commodities market in September of 2018. The SFSA decided to issue a warning and an administrative fine of approximately $36 million. Nasdaq Clearing has been cooperating throughout the investigation with the regulator and maintains a constructive working relationship with the SFSA. Immediately following the event and independent of the SFSA review, Nasdaq Clearing launched a comprehensive enhancement program to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the clearinghouse. We are comfortable that the program effectively addresses the observations made by the SFSA in their review. While the SFSA recognize the changes made by the clearinghouse, our initial review indicates that the findings appear to be disproportionate to the severity and impact of the incident and to the size of the commodities business that the clearinghouse serves. We are continuing to review the decision and evaluating our legal options and we\u2019ll communicate any next steps to our members and the broader public in due course. Now, turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $71 million to $406 million. The increase reflects a $53 million, or 16% organic increase inclusive of the $25 million reserve related to market technology. Excluding the reserve, the organic increase was $28 million, or 8% as compared to the total organic revenue growth of 20%. The increase was also due to a $6 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $12 million increase from the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. As noted in our January 12 press release, the full year 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion were above the high-end of our prior guidance range due to three primary factors. First, higher performance compensation and variable expenses related to higher-than-expected fourth quarter 2020 revenues associated with elevated trading volumes, a quarterly record in assets under management in licensed ETPs and a multi-decade high in the number of Nasdaq IPOs; second, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the $25 million reserve related to the expected loss of the Market Technology implementation project. On that last item, I will spend a moment explaining the accounting aspect of the reserve. The accounting for highly customized software system delivery contracts, such as certain of our Market Technology contracts requires us to record a loss in the quarter when it becomes probable that costs will exceed future revenues from the contract. During the fourth quarter, as part of our regular review of significant implementation projects, we refined and revised our plans relating to a large-scale post-trade clearing implementation project for a specific client. In that process, it became probable that we would incur a loss over the remainder of that particular project in part due to the logistical implications of COVID-19. As a result, we recorded the $25 million reserve that reflects the expected loss. Turning to Slide 10, we are initiating our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.55 billion to $1.62 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint reflects an approximate 3% organic increase compared to 2020 excluding the $25 million reserve on the Market Tech contract. An additional approximate 3% increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as expenses due to the net impact of M&A. The guidance does reflect the anticipated closing of Verafin acquisition in the first quarter of 2021. Now, moving to operating profits and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the fourth quarter 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin of 48% was unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the $25 million reserve, the non-GAAP operating margin would have been 52% in the fourth quarter, up 400 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $24 million in the fourth quarter 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior-year period. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 26% for the full year 2020. For the full year of 2021, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq in the fourth quarter 2020 was $268 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $215 million, or $1.29 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt increased by $1.97 billion versus September 30, 2020, primarily due to bond issuances of $1.88 billion in December and an $89 million increase in our outstanding Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. The proceeds of the December offering are expected to be used to partially finance the Verafin acquisition, along with additional borrowings of approximately $500 million prior to the closing of the transaction. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.5 times, an increase from 2.4 times from the third quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter 2020, the Company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $36 million. And during 2020, the Company also repurchased common stock in the amount of $222 million. Now, I\u2019d like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of Verafin. We continue to progress through the regulatory approval process and expect Verafin to close in the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we are projecting in excess of $140 million in Verafin revenue for the full year of 2021. This will need to be adjusted for both the actual closing date, as well as the impact of an accounting writedown of deferred revenue. We currently estimate this purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue to total $35 million, which will impact recognized revenues over the 12-month period following the close. The acquisition of Verafin is expected to deliver non-GAAP EPS accretion beginning in 2022 and increase thereafter. And I\u2019ll remind investors and analysts that Nasdaq\u2019s organic growth calculation reflects contributions from acquired businesses beginning 12 months after close, and as such, Verafin will be included in organic growth beginning in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, as Adena mentioned, this will be my 73rd consecutive and last quarterly call before retirement. I want to take a moment to thank my incredible team and outstanding colleagues for all their extensive efforts, contributions and kindness during my time here at Nasdaq. I also want to thank Adena for her exceptional and principled leadership. It has been an honor and an education working for Adena and our esteemed Board of Directors. I also want to express my appreciation and gratitude to you, the investors and analysts with whom I\u2019ve had the pleasure and privilege of working with over the years. And I especially want to thank my family for allowing me the time to pursue my career and I\u2019m very much looking forward to be able to repay them some of that time, whether they want it or not, over the coming years. As I said on the last call, I could not be more excited that Ann will be taking hold of the CFO reigns. I\u2019ve so enjoyed working with her, she is a person of integrity, intelligence and initiative who I am confident will serve this organization with excellence. Ann, I look forward to you breaking my quarterly record as CFO of an exchange group and I will definitely hologram into the Q2 2039 investor call when that occurs. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes, good morning. First, I want to congratulate both Michael and Jeremy as they move on to the next phase of their career. But both have deep roots in the exchange space. So I congratulate both guys. So, my question is mainly for Michael. I didn\u2019t fully understand, I guess, the drop in revenues, I think it was for an investment intelligence, but the overriding question here is really for you, Adena. It\u2019s \u2013 when you look at the organic growth rate, I know you adjusted it up for Verafin a bit. But if you take, for example, in Investment Intelligence, the 5% to 8%, we have run at 18% and 25% the last two quarters. Is it still \u2013 I think the range is still reasonable for the run rate to your experience and especially in Investment Intelligence?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Why don\u2019t I \u2013 I\u2019ll actually start with having Michael just make sure he clarifies the index revenue discussion that he had of the fourth quarter versus the first quarter if you want to provide any clarification, Michael? And then I will answer the broader question, Rich.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes, Rich, the \u2013 I can\u2019t go into too much detail, but basically, the way the contract works is that there are certain elevation points in the contract. And so what we want to basically try to say is that some of those reset at the beginning of each year and so depending on activity and on a comparable basis then Q1 of 2021 if it has the same mix and the same trading activity as compared to Q4, there will be a $7 million decrease in the run rate for that \u2013 in the amount for that period in Q1. Does that answer that question?\nRich Repetto: Yes, yes.\nMichael Ptasznik: Okay, great.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Yes. And in terms of the broader question, Rich, we obviously are extremely proud of the growth that we\u2019ve been experiencing in our Investment Intelligence segments. And we are so pleased by the level of investor interest in our indexes and we do think that our index franchise generally does lean into the future of the economy. So we are very pleased with that. I think we also are seeing solid growth across market data and the analytics businesses and that are more stable, but also just really, really strong. So whether or not you are asking whether we would change our medium to long-term outlook for the business, I think that we are maintaining our medium to long-term outlook for the business on the back of the fact that index values can fluctuate. But I also agree that as we continue to perform and we continue to see progress in the business, we will, of course, continue to update our outlook for that business.\nRich Repetto: Okay. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. My question is around the Market Tech segment. So if you could discuss the order intakes, the decline kind of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. I know you have mentioned kind of COVID and some delays in implementation, so maybe discuss that? And then in the context of the charge and then what that means as we think about the margin for that business going forward as you kind of restructure that contract and the progress and the growth in margin that you\u2019ve talked about over a multi-year time period, does that accelerate this as you kind of reset the bar for some of the more unprofitable contracts?\nAdena Friedman: Okay, great. Thanks. So on order intake, I would say that the primary driver of a lower order intake for 2020 has been the impact of the COVID situation. When we think about our engagement with our clients and particularly for those that are taking on some very significant projects with us, I think there are two things that come into play. First is the fact that many of our market infrastructure operator clients have been really, really focused on managing the capacity and resiliency in this year where they have all experienced very high volumes. And we are very proud of the fact that our technology has served them well, but they have been more focused on the here and now and some of the projects that they have been planning to do and planning to work with us on early in the year were temporarily put on hold. So we are starting to engage more productively with them as they start to think through the future. I am going into 2021. But I definitely think that was part of it. And then the second thing is that when we are engaging with new clients and we did sign, as we mentioned, we did sign 29 new clients in 2020. But it is important, in some cases, particularly with the larger ones that would drive the order intake number that they have a lot of engagement, including in-person engagement and that\u2019s been much harder this year. So, some of those projects again have just had elongated sales cycles. So, I think it really has been a COVID impact on order intake, primarily. In terms of the margin going forward, I think the way to look at that particular situation was, it is an isolated situation. We have had actually \u2013 we have signed over the last five years 38 new clients that would be in a similar situation where they have very - they have large scale contracts, we do quarterly reviews, we have a steering board internally to track and monitor the projects and this is the only one in which we are seeing a situation where we have a loss. But in that particular case, we are recognizing that loss now, which then for the remaining life of the contract means, we will not recognize a loss, assuming it goes according to our expectations. I think though that - but it doesn\u2019t accelerate the margin. It just \u2013 it makes it, so that this one isolated situation doesn\u2019t have a negative impact on the margin going forward. I hope that answered your question, Dan.\nDan Fannon: Yes, thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a quick two-parter there. Just Listing Services obviously very strong, just wanted to get a better handle on the - I know there could be episodic movements in that line on a sort of quarterly basis in terms of how the revenue is calculated, but given the very strong environment that we have seen, maybe just sort of an outlook as we come into 2021 on the revenue side of that? And then I missed part of the Verafin revenue expectation if you could just clarify, Michael, I got the $35 million of deferred revenue, which if you could just clarify if that will be included in your adjusted results and a contra revenue for 2021 for Verafin and then to reiterate the top line that you mentioned for Verafin in 2021? And congratulations by the way as well.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you. Yes, great. Thanks, Brian. I will answer the listings question and I\u2019ll turn it over to Michael for the Verafin question. On the listings side, I think that if you think about the key drivers of recurring revenue in that business and much of the revenue is recurring in that business, having recently mentioned the fact that we had a net increase of 8% in terms of total listings on that business year-over-year. We spend - if that\u2019s the exit rate, that becomes the entry rate for 2021. So \u2013 and as you know, we collect fees annually and we collect them in the beginning of the year. So, I think that, that\u2019s one thing to think about in terms of the fundamental drivers of the business. I think the second thing is that as we look at our SaaS businesses, our IR services, particularly, our IR technology and board portal business as well as the one report system, those are all kind of what I would call reoccurring contracts, many of them are multi-years, some of them, many of them, of course, recur year-over-year. And so if you have a higher exit rate for last year 2020 and therefore you have a higher entry rate for 2021 that obviously occurs for benefits. But you are right that there are some revenues on what we call our advisory service, including our ESG advisory services that are project-based. And so that revenue is more that we might have a one-time project, we might have recurring projects, but that part of the revenue is a little less recurring. So hopefully, it gives you a sense of how to think about the fundamental drivers of that business as we go into 2021. Why don\u2019t we turn it over to Michael on the Verafin question?\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes, thanks Adena. So, on Verafin, we said consistently what we said when we announced the transaction that the 2021 revenue we would anticipate to be in excess of $140 million. But there is the couple of adjustments and the first adjustment is that obviously we will have to adjust that for the timing of the closing which we do anticipate to be in Q1. So, the 140 is a full year number and so we just have to prorate that accordingly for the amount and once we close the transaction. Secondly, we currently estimate that the purchase price address from either deferred revenue which will be reflected in our results will come off of that $140 million or the prorated $140 million in the first year as well. And so we estimate that there will be a $35 million reduction to that adjusted number in the first year of results.\nBrian Bedell: And that eliminates for 2022 right, so we go back to the 140 plus \u2013 the 30% growth rate or whatever we have for Verafin in \u201822.\nMichael Ptasznik: Well, it\u2019s technically over the first 12 months or so and again, we are finalizing the adjustments, we will be able to provide more updates on that in the next quarter results. So we will be able to fine tune that number a little better, but it\u2019s over the first 12 months. So, it could flow into 2022, but only really through Q1 since we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much and congrats again, Michael.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank you very much for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. I think just a few cleanup questions here on \u2013 I guess investment intelligence. On the index business, can you just give us the breakdown between trading and AUM? And then, on market data specifically audit fees and why the sequential decline in that line? That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So, I think on the index side, what we generally look at Alex is how much of their revenue is coming from AUM driven versus other and other is the futures trading as well as the data that comes \u2013 the index data. So when we kind of evaluate that business, we say about two-thirds of the revenue comes from AUM and about a third of the revenue comes from the futures and the data. The other thing we have said in the past is that the futures revenue could be a range of 10% to 20% of the overall. And I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, it was those numbers are generally accurate. And as obviously, every quarter, the futures revenue will fluctuate a little bit, but those types of ranges are the right way to look at it, including the fourth quarter. In terms of the market data side, I think that what we call revenue from previously unreported usage, it was up $2 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but was actually was lower for the year versus 2019 and so the fact that continued to show a nice performance in market data even with the lower revenues from that particular activity, I think is a testament to the strength of the business.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes. Just the actual number was $7 million for the quarter, Alex in the market data and again, really it\u2019s coming from sales of the product to new clients is one of the big drivers of the market data business.\nAlex Kramm: And by the way, so you are not going to be more specific on the index breakdown last couple of quarters, you gave us some pretty exact numbers. You are going to stop doing that?\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes, I think we said that last quarter that we wouldn\u2019t necessarily provide that on a regular basis going forward. And so the two-thirds numbers is the number to keep in mind.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. Thanks, guys.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nChris Allen: Yes, good morning, everyone. I just wanted to touch on the sequential strength in market technology it\u2019s usually a seasonal impact from change requests, but a little bit surprised just given kind of the current environment, just from activity perspective, from your client activity perspective, and just some of the challenges of doing kind of one-off things. So any color there would be helpful?\nAdena Friedman: I think in terms of \u2013 I mean, as you know the change request revenues and kind of the change requests and other revenues there do reflect some short-term work that we do for our clients as well as other adjustments we make to agreements that can accrue to our benefit in the third quarter. So I think that those types of revenues just as they do fluctuate, the fourth quarter tends to be a higher quarter for us as people plan for us to do things before the end of the year and as we frankly work with clients to try to get commitments out of them before the end of the year. So that tends just to be a higher number for any particular \u2013 at the fourth quarter has to be the highest quarter. I am not sure if there is anymore color to get on that, Michael.\nMichael Ptasznik: Well, I think if you look historically, that is very consistent that the fourth quarter from a seasonality standpoint is the highest and it really is driven by change requests, even if things are later this year relative to others in the full year concept on a full year basis relative to Q3, Q4 is always the highest quarter.\nChris Allen: Got it. Thank you.\nMichael Ptasznik: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Ghosh: As you know, Michael, I just have another quick one on market tech I think you noticed that in segments you continue to see some impact as a result of the pandemic. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about let me say a specific region on client side that\u2019s getting more impacted as a result of this? And any sense of that you think? And then with regard to Verafin, again, that was added in just yet, but is there any sense or any color that you can provide if Verafin is facing similar pressures or there is anything unique about that business where maybe it\u2019s not as impacted? Just I am thinking about that run-rate of 30% of revenue growth that\u2019s in there, should we expect that to continue? So, just any color there would be great? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure, yes. So I think that if we look at the overall market tech business, you have got the market infrastructure operators and then we have our banks and brokers clients. And so I think it\u2019s important as I mentioned in my comments that it\u2019s really in the market infrastructure operator segments that we saw slowing of sales as well as the elongation of some of the significant projects. And I think that as we think about our engagement with those clients, as I mentioned also one of those clients really focused much of the year on their immediate needs to make sure that they were managing to capacity and resiliency in managing to current trading levels. And so if they were planning to do some enhancements or changes or upgrades, they kind of put those plans on hold. I think also, they know that as they go forward with those plans, they want to be able to have the right focus from their customers and their customers are also dealing with these elevated trading volumes. So, to put on them an upgrade in the middle of that, I think was also something they were hesitant to do. So as we exited 2020 and we are starting to \u2013 we are starting to see more engagement from those clients saying, we can\u2019t put these things off wherever and that\u2019s starting to engages us, but I would have to say still is not at the levels that we are experiencing before COVID I think last year. I think also some of the new markets clients that were very active and engaged with us are continuing to engage with some of them have hit funding issues or just as they are looking at launching their products or waiting until more normalized environment. So, those are the things that are \u2013 that\u2019s the color behind that. On the banks and broker side though and this actually plays into the Verafin question, we actually continue to see nice healthy engagement, healthy growth and also it\u2019s a SaaS based delivery. So, it\u2019s a much easier thing for the clients to take and to integrate, whether it\u2019s our surveillance or our trade execution solutions. And so that was \u2013 had a more, I would say more of a normal environment as well as some increased demand for surveillance as the clients went online went to the remote setting and they had to add users to make sure that they had proper coverage. I think that then plays into the Verafin question, which is there more aligned with the banks and brokers where it\u2019s a SaaS based cloud based delivery. So, it\u2019s the right implementation for the clients and they continued to have a lot of engagement with banks and brokers managing through their anti-financial crime program. So, they didn\u2019t see the same level of impact as we did see at the market infrastructure operator clients and I think that they had a solid entity here. So, we feel good about their progress and their momentum going into 2021.\nAri Ghosh: That\u2019s great. Thanks so much. Congrats, Michael.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thanks, Ari.\nOperator: Thank you. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question only then re-queue for any follow-ups. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just on the expected guidance for \u201821 are there just any clarifications on getting to the strong year in \u201820. I think maybe you mentioned 30% from FX just wanted to get the assumption around that. And then if we do give in your backdrop where we see some slowdown in index and listings just given the strong growth that you guys you guys have seen, how much flexibility is there in the expense base related to maybe those businesses.\nMichael Ptasznik: So, the 3% of FX is really a combination of the weakening of the dollar relative to the SEK and the euro. And we \u2013 in the guidance that we provided, we are really looking at kind of current spot rates is how we develop those estimates and that\u2019s where we come up with the delta there, but it has been fairly significant relative to the average for last year. And then there is always ability to make some level of adjustments. I think it\u2019s important that we want to continue to invest in the business and continue to grow it for the future, which is where a lot of our investments are is to build those new products and capabilities. But obviously, if they are \u2013 as you saw the fourth quarter where we had some increases in marketing spend and some other comp related items then periods where things were slowed down, then there are certain factors that will adjust accordingly, but I don\u2019t want to take away from the required investment going forward.\nMike Carrier: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Your line is open. \nKen Hill: Hi, good morning. I wanted to come back to the corporate platforms growth that was so strong in the quarter, I know you called out a number of items there, but kind of thinking about particularly like the listings business going forward with IPOs getting so much attention also from a SPAC activity perspective that\u2019s really picked up. Can you comment on what you are seeing there in your pipeline and then maybe some of the impacts on SPAC and how that might kind of how it impacts your \u2013 not only your trading and your listings business, but also maybe Nasdaq private markets how to think about that? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So I think that it\u2019s worth noting that of the 316 IPOs that we have last year, I believe, 184 of operating companies and we had \u2013 we were actually very proud of the fact we had an 82% or 86% win rate for this company\u2019s listings as well and then the remainder was back. And as we go into 2021, we are continuing to see a very healthy activity level in terms of listings of both operating companies and SPACs, particularly SPACs. But I think that when we look at our pipeline, we have a longer view of operating company potentials versus SPACs. SPACs tend to come to market quickly tend to engage with us quickly and we don\u2019t have as much line of sight. So, we probably really only have some level of understanding of the demand for SPACs in the first quarter. And then our line of sight really diminishes, I think with our operating companies who tend to have a little bit of a longer view. So, my answer to the question is that we have a very active pipeline in both SPACs and operating companies. And I would say, SPACs for the next several weeks probably and in terms of we don\u2019t see beyond that. And with operating companies, we certainly see a healthy pipeline through the first half of the year. And then we will have to see how the markets continue to develop. But as you know, the market and the performance of the market does have an impact on when companies tend to go out. So, assuming a benign market environment, we should have a pretty healthy first half.\nKen Hill: Got it. Thanks. Just I guess anything to think about from an asset private market perspective as it relates for so many companies coming public let\u2019s say?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I mean, for as many companies that are going public, there are still thousands of private companies. And as we said, even with a really active IPO environment last year, we had 90 private market programs and it was a record for us. So, I think that we shift in that there is just a lot of companies out there. Some of them are ready for the public markets and some are preferring to stay private and the great thing is that Nasdaq has the ability to serve both of them.\nKen Hill: Got it. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: Great, thank you. So, you mentioned private markets as being a contributor to the increase in corporate platforms revenue. Can you remind us what the revenues are in private markets today? And then should we assume that most of those revenues are variable or is there a recurring component to that too?\nAdena Friedman: Alright. So, first of all, we don\u2019t disclose specific revenue related to Nasdaq private market. It is part of the listing sub-segments that we don\u2019t separately disclose that. So we can make that available to you. But I would say that the nature of the revenue is primarily variable, you are correct. It\u2019s basically \u2013 you got paid for the programs that we execute on behalf of our clients, the tender program. So, it is not as recurring in nature as the listings business is, but the quantum of that is it\u2019s a very \u2013 it is a small percentage of our listings business overall, just to say.\nChris Harris: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Hey, good morning, everybody. Quick question about Verafin, I guess one clarification around how much in Verafin expenses do you guys have embedded in your 2021 OpEx guidance obviously take into account that it\u2019s a partial year? But also bigger picture as you guys are getting little closer to closing the transaction, can you provide some color on sort of customer feedback you are hearing I know part of the rationale was some pretty compelling cross-selling opportunities and what kind of growth you guys expect for Verafin\u2019s revenue once the deal closes for, I guess, both revenues and expenses?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So, Michael, do you want to take the first part?\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes, sure. So we are breaking out that Verafin explicitly, but what I can do is reiterate the comments we made when we announced the acquisition which was that Verafin was offering about 26% EBITDA margin and so you can take that into account and estimate the amount that you will put towards Verafin and then obviously you have to adjust it for the year. So, then Adena, the remainder?\nAdena Friedman: Sure, yes. So as we engage with our clients, actually, their clients and our clients have been very positive. So I think that if we think about the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks that we serve with our anti-financial crime technology, particularly our surveillance technology, we have had a lot of good calls from clients saying want to learn more. It\u2019s just a product that could apply to us how are you going to integrate that in with your capital markets offering etcetera? So these are great questions to be getting from our customers before we even closed the deal. I think as we mentioned when we announced the deal, there is a journey to take with Verafin to continue to advance the product to get them ready to sever the largest banks in the world, but that is obviously our mission and our joint vision for the business. And so that will be an area, our significant area of investment and our primary area of investment is to continue to advance the platform to be able to serve the largest banks over time and that\u2019s a big part of why we bought it. So it\u2019s great to know that our clients are very interested in engaging with us from already. I think the second thing on their clients is I think they do appreciate us as a high integrity player we have obviously a strong presence in the market, we have a strong balance sheet, we have the ability to really manage the business together. And I think that they are very pleased with us as the partner to Verafin going forward.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you please talk about the traction of cybernetics on the buy-side surveillance and the latest development of the Market Abuse Regulation in Europe? Is it still on track compared to your original expectation? Any more color would be very helpful? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, with the Market Abuse or what we call MARs, that is definitely been \u2013 it has been over the last few years, actually a good catalyst for our sales of our surveillance solutions to the brokerage community, and also as the buy-side has been managing through that change, it also definitely opens doors to conversations in sales for the cybernetics or what we\u2019re now calling our buy-side surveillance solution. We are making good traction with the buy-side surveillance solution in terms of sales, and it\u2019s been, I would say, that we\u2019ve had a relatively good momentum year there. But it\u2019s still a very small part of our business. So \u2013 and it a small acquisition, and it continues to be an area where we are making sure we are tailoring it to the needs of the buy-side, I would say, that the original product was \u2013 is a great product, but wasn\u2019t quite tailored to what the buy-side specific needs were. So, we have spent the last couple of years really engaging with customers and making sure that we have a solution that really meets their needs, and now we\u2019ve had more sales momentum. But it continues to be small, but we\u2019re optimistic there.\nOwen Lau: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman for any closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you. Well, in closing, Nasdaq\u2019s fourth quarter and full year of 2020 performance was solid and we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. And our leadership team remains focused on executing our technology led strategy to deliver for our stakeholders and I look forward to our continued discussions throughout the year on the progress that we will be making against those strategic priorities. So thank you very much for your time today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before I begin my remarks, I would like to note that we are starting the new year at the depths of the COVID crisis and we continue to focus on maintaining our employees' health and safety while executing on our critical role in facilitating capital raising, liquidity and price discovery in the economies in which we and our clients operate. While we manage through this very challenging environment, the rollout of the vaccines provides a new hope for 2021. Throughout this health crisis, I have remained extremely proud of the resilience of Nasdaq's business, our team and our client community. Over the past year, we have deepened our partnerships with our clients and worked together with them to ensure that resiliency of the capital markets to handle unprecedented volumes and to facilitate near record levels of capital raising across our listed companies. Capital markets and the role Nasdaq plays within them have never been more important as a critical source of funding and liquidity for innovation and job creation, including vaccine research and production as well as for funding and liquidity needed to help companies weather through this very challenging period. We remained steadfast and unwavering in our commitments to our employees, our clients and our mission as we enter 2021. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full-year 2020 and fourth quarter of 2020 financial and business performance; the progress we have made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction and our ambitions for 2021 and beyond. Turning to our results, I am very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2020. First, for the fourth quarter, we achieved $788 million in net revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020, a 22% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.60 rose 24% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Turning to the full-year of 2020, we generated total net revenues of $2.9 billion, including a 10% organic revenue growth from our Solutions segments, along with 21% organic growth, a revenue increased from our Market Services segment due primarily to elevated trading volumes in U.S. equities and options. Total organic revenue growth for the year was 14%. In terms of the annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, and software-as-a-service or SaaS revenue disclosures, we introduced at our November 2020 Investor Day, ARR ended the year at $1.58 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020, up 9% year-over-year and annualized SaaS revenue was $456 million, up 11% year-over-year. The strong development across these types of revenues creates a healthy core to build off of going forward, independent of fluctuating trade volumes or market levels. 2020 was another year of robust execution for Nasdaq against the unique operating environment that none of us could have predicted a year ago. The strong results from the fourth quarter highlights the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model, which allowed us to address the needs of our clients in a unique capital markets environment, including periods of elevated trading volumes, rising benchmark index valuations, and a very strong period of new listings and capital formation. Throughout the year, we also continued to invest organically and inorganically to advance our offerings, guided by our strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider, while also investing to sustain the strong competitive position of our core marketplace foundation. Because of the strong performance and for the year and in particular, the very strong finish in the fourth quarter, we entered 2021 with incredible momentum. We now have begun our fourth year since the 2017 announcement of our new vision for Nasdaq. Our full-year results illustrate how we can deliver on our strategy and more importantly, how our disciplined client-centric focus is creating value not just for our clients, but for all of our stakeholders. Now, I am going to turn to specific highlights for our businesses, focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Investment Intelligence segment delivered $247 million in net revenue during the fourth quarter, a 27% increase from the prior year period, primarily driven by especially strong momentum in index licensing as well as positive contributions from both analytics and end market data. We set new quarterly highs in both our index revenues of $97 million and end of period ETP assets under management tracking Nasdaq indexes of $359 billion. As we noted in our Investor Day presentation, our Investment Intelligence segment has been repositioned for improved growth as we look to deepen our engagement with asset managers, asset owners and consultants and the clients from our market data and index franchises. We are diligently focused on building out this business to be the essential partner to the investment community. As they move into 2021, we are making investments to ensure these growth engines have the fuel to continue performing in the long-term. For example, we are progressing our alternative investment workflow and data platform for asset owners with new capabilities, coupled with our integration with Globus, and we will continue to advance our expansion of our increasingly popular indexes and trusted data products to new clients and new geographies. Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $106 million in total net revenues for the fourth quarter and 8% increase from the prior year period. This is driven by higher SaaS revenues and changes in foreign exchange rates, while revenues from market infrastructure operator projects stayed - remained flat. Over the course of 2020, I am pleased to report market technology welcome 29 new customers, of which 25 chose our SaaS products. As we stated in the previous investor calls, service implementations change request projects, new order intake levels from our traditional market operator clients and funding for new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by pandemic-related factors. In the second-half of 2020, we have taken actions, in particular, dedicating more resources to mitigate project delays and to better deliver for our customers. In a communication to our investors issued on January 12, we noted in one particular project, specifically an on-premise enterprise software delivery of a complex post-trade clearing and settlement solution for an exchange group, changes to our implementation timing and expected costs resulted in a significant discrete $25 million expense for the period. The expense resulted from taking a one-time reserve to reflect the expected losses on the approximately 13-year fixed price contract. The need for a reserve resulted from an updated detailed review of the implementation project with the client and with our internal technology and finance team. We expect to increase implementation spend from higher resourcing for the project and a longer project duration due probably to the aforementioned COVID-related impacts, but also due to a prior under-appreciation of this one project's unique demands. While some of the issues are very specific to this one project, we will apply what we have learned to ensure future contracts fit with the profitability objectives of the market technology business. As we examine the broader market technology business with our market infrastructure operator clients, we are starting to see improved sales opportunities as the exit 2020. However, we have not seen a full recovery to a pre-COVID sales environment. Both new and existing market infrastructure operator clients recognize that we are operating in a unique period with unusually elongated sales cycles. But we are \u2013 they are engaging with us with incrementally more energy in the last few months to move forward with new projects and system upgrades. Additionally, our buy side and sell side technology business led by our staff base trade execution and trade surveillance offerings maintained strong momentum throughout 2020 with 13% revenue growth for the full year and we entered 2021 with a position of strength in this segment of our business. During the fourth quarter, we also announced an agreement to acquire Verafin, which provides more than 2,000 financial institutions in North America with a cloud-based platform to detect, investigate and report money laundering and financial fraud. Our statistics on the United Nations notes that up to $2 trillion in laundered money flows through the financial system every year as criminals continue to find sophisticated methods for moving funds undetected, robust, advanced anti-money laundering technology have become essential for financial institutions. Once closed, Verafin will compliment Nasdaq's established regtech leadership to create a global SaaS leader focused on a $13 billion market for anti-financial crime technology solutions. Our long-term mission together with Verafin is to become the market leading provider of anti-financial crime technology. Despite the challenges we faced in market technology in 2020, we remain highly confident in our strategy and in our ability to execute against new opportunities going forward. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our market services segment delivered net revenues of $291 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of 29% from the prior year period. This area of our business maintained its strong competitive position across both the United States and Europe, while our U.S. options business set a new quarterly trading volume record. The record fourth quarter helped make 2020 the most active year for options trading ever averaging 27.7 million contracts traded a day, a 58% increase over 2019. Nasdaq revenue industry in multiply listed options for the 11th year in a row. In fact, for the first time, Nasdaq was the largest options marketplace platform in the country for the year, including trading both index options and multiply listed options. Meanwhile, our European Equities Exchange Complex set a new 10-year high on on-exchange market share in 2020. Finally, our corporate platform segment delivered revenue of $144 million in the fourth quarter, a 12% increase despite particularly strong IPO and private market activity in our listings business as well as increased demand for IR intelligence, ESG services and board portal offerings. Our team successfully adopted all elements of the IPO process to a virtual environment. And as a result, for the eighth consecutive year, Nasdaq led the United States exchanges for IPOs in 2020 with 316 capitalizing on an incredibly busy year for new issues and with a 67% overall IPO win rate, including an 83% win rate for operating companies and a 56% win rate for SPACs. Also for the second year in a row, Nasdaq ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised with $80.9 billion, representing 52% of the industry total. The fourth quarter was particularly strong in terms of activity. We welcomed 142 IPOs and this momentum has carried into 2021 with a particularly busy January. Meanwhile, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges continued to attract new companies from across Europe adding 67 new listings, including 45 IPOs in 2020. We also had 20 new companies switch their corporate listings to Nasdaq, including American Electric Power, AstraZeneca and Keurig Dr Pepper. These 20 transfers represent aggregate $282 billion in global equity market capitalization. Across the entire Nasdaq listing business in both the U.S. and the Nordics, our corporate issue account was 8% in 2020, setting us up in a strong position as we begin 2021. On the private company side, our Nasdaq private market business set a new record for annual volume in 2020, facilitating 90 private company liquidity programs and the fourth quarter was particularly busy with 49 transactions completed on the platform, a new quarterly record. Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions, particularly our ESG related technology and consultative tools, drove growth in our IR and ESG services sub-segment, which saw an 8% increase in the fourth quarter. And lastly, during the period, we filed a new U.S. listing proposal at the SEC that seeks to standardize board level diversity disclosures coupled with recommended minimum diversity standard through a have or explained framework. As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, 2020 represented an important year regarding the progress we have made on our strategic journey. As we continue on that path, I would like to reiterate the core ambitions we outlined at our Investor Day in November. In market technology, our core ambition is to be the trusted market technology and anti-financial crime technology partner and our key 2021 initiatives for the segments are to deploy and drive adoption of SaaS market technology solutions and to enhance our anti-financial crime business for the combination with Verafin. In investment intelligence, our core ambition is to be the essential partner for the investment community and our key 2021 initiatives are to offer a full service alternative workflow platform for asset owners and to accelerate the expansion of indexes and cloud delivered data services to new clients and new geographies. In corporate platforms, our core ambition is to be the leading provider of capital market solutions to corporates. And our key 2021 initiatives are to expand Nasdaq's share of U.S. corporate listings and to establish the leading end-to-end corporate ESG reporting workflow tools to complement our IR and governance solutions. Lastly, in-market services, our core ambition is to be the pre-eminent market operator for equities and equity derivatives in the U.S. and Europe. And our key 2021 initiatives are to continue to implement our multi-year migration of our derivatives markets to our next generation platforms increasingly leveraging the cloud and to expand our suite of distinctive equity and equity derivative trading products and solutions. We look forward to updating on our progress on these ambitions in the quarters to come. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter pretty solid results for Nasdaq completing a successful 2020 for our company. Moving forward into 2021, we remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategic pivot to maximize opportunities as a technology and data analytics provider while maintaining segment leadership in our foundational marketplace businesses in the U.S. and Europe. We will officially celebrate Nasdaq's 50th anniversary next month. As we near this important milestone in our corporate history, I remain confident that we are moving the company in the right direction as we build upon the strong momentum generated last year. With that, I will turn it over to Michael in a moment to review the financial details for his final earnings call before handing the mantle to Ann at the end of February. While we spend some time in our last earnings call and our Investor Day reflecting on Michael's incredible career here at Nasdaq and at PMS, on this occasion of Michael's 73rd consecutive and final earnings call. I would like to thank Michael for his tremendous service to Nasdaq. We will miss him greatly, but we are well prepared for his transition as Ann Dennison stepped into the role of CFO and Jeremy Skule expands his responsibilities to become our new Chief Strategy Officer. Now, over to you, Michael. Sure. Why don't I \u2013 I'll actually start with having Michael just make sure he clarifies the index revenue discussion that he had of the fourth quarter versus the first quarter if you want to provide any clarification, Michael? And then I will answer the broader question, Rich. Okay. Yes. And in terms of the broader question, Rich, we obviously are extremely proud of the growth that we've been experiencing in our Investment Intelligence segments. And we are so pleased by the level of investor interest in our indexes and we do think that our index franchise generally does lean into the future of the economy. So we are very pleased with that. I think we also are seeing solid growth across market data and the analytics businesses and that are more stable, but also just really, really strong. So whether or not you are asking whether we would change our medium to long-term outlook for the business, I think that we are maintaining our medium to long-term outlook for the business on the back of the fact that index values can fluctuate. But I also agree that as we continue to perform and we continue to see progress in the business, we will, of course, continue to update our outlook for that business. Sure. Okay, great. Thanks. So on order intake, I would say that the primary driver of a lower order intake for 2020 has been the impact of the COVID situation. When we think about our engagement with our clients and particularly for those that are taking on some very significant projects with us, I think there are two things that come into play. First is the fact that many of our market infrastructure operator clients have been really, really focused on managing the capacity and resiliency in this year where they have all experienced very high volumes. And we are very proud of the fact that our technology has served them well, but they have been more focused on the here and now and some of the projects that they have been planning to do and planning to work with us on early in the year were temporarily put on hold. So we are starting to engage more productively with them as they start to think through the future. I am going into 2021. But I definitely think that was part of it. And then the second thing is that when we are engaging with new clients and we did sign, as we mentioned, we did sign 29 new clients in 2020. But it is important, in some cases, particularly with the larger ones that would drive the order intake number that they have a lot of engagement, including in-person engagement and that's been much harder this year. So, some of those projects again have just had elongated sales cycles. So, I think it really has been a COVID impact on order intake, primarily. In terms of the margin going forward, I think the way to look at that particular situation was, it is an isolated situation. We have had actually \u2013 we have signed over the last five years 38 new clients that would be in a similar situation where they have very - they have large scale contracts, we do quarterly reviews, we have a steering board internally to track and monitor the projects and this is the only one in which we are seeing a situation where we have a loss. But in that particular case, we are recognizing that loss now, which then for the remaining life of the contract means, we will not recognize a loss, assuming it goes according to our expectations. I think though that - but it doesn't accelerate the margin. It just \u2013 it makes it, so that this one isolated situation doesn't have a negative impact on the margin going forward. I hope that answered your question, Dan. Okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. Yes, great. Thanks, Brian. I will answer the listings question and I'll turn it over to Michael for the Verafin question. On the listings side, I think that if you think about the key drivers of recurring revenue in that business and much of the revenue is recurring in that business, having recently mentioned the fact that we had a net increase of 8% in terms of total listings on that business year-over-year. We spend - if that's the exit rate, that becomes the entry rate for 2021. So \u2013 and as you know, we collect fees annually and we collect them in the beginning of the year. So, I think that, that's one thing to think about in terms of the fundamental drivers of the business. I think the second thing is that as we look at our SaaS businesses, our IR services, particularly, our IR technology and board portal business as well as the one report system, those are all kind of what I would call reoccurring contracts, many of them are multi-years, some of them, many of them, of course, recur year-over-year. And so if you have a higher exit rate for last year 2020 and therefore you have a higher entry rate for 2021 that obviously occurs for benefits. But you are right that there are some revenues on what we call our advisory service, including our ESG advisory services that are project-based. And so that revenue is more that we might have a one-time project, we might have recurring projects, but that part of the revenue is a little less recurring. So hopefully, it gives you a sense of how to think about the fundamental drivers of that business as we go into 2021. Why don't we turn it over to Michael on the Verafin question? Sure. So, I think on the index side, what we generally look at Alex is how much of their revenue is coming from AUM driven versus other and other is the futures trading as well as the data that comes \u2013 the index data. So when we kind of evaluate that business, we say about two-thirds of the revenue comes from AUM and about a third of the revenue comes from the futures and the data. The other thing we have said in the past is that the futures revenue could be a range of 10% to 20% of the overall. And I think that if you look at the fourth quarter, it was those numbers are generally accurate. And as obviously, every quarter, the futures revenue will fluctuate a little bit, but those types of ranges are the right way to look at it, including the fourth quarter. In terms of the market data side, I think that what we call revenue from previously unreported usage, it was up $2 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but was actually was lower for the year versus 2019 and so the fact that continued to show a nice performance in market data even with the lower revenues from that particular activity, I think is a testament to the strength of the business. Thank you. I think in terms of \u2013 I mean, as you know the change request revenues and kind of the change requests and other revenues there do reflect some short-term work that we do for our clients as well as other adjustments we make to agreements that can accrue to our benefit in the third quarter. So I think that those types of revenues just as they do fluctuate, the fourth quarter tends to be a higher quarter for us as people plan for us to do things before the end of the year and as we frankly work with clients to try to get commitments out of them before the end of the year. So that tends just to be a higher number for any particular \u2013 at the fourth quarter has to be the highest quarter. I am not sure if there is anymore color to get on that, Michael. Sure, yes. So I think that if we look at the overall market tech business, you have got the market infrastructure operators and then we have our banks and brokers clients. And so I think it's important as I mentioned in my comments that it's really in the market infrastructure operator segments that we saw slowing of sales as well as the elongation of some of the significant projects. And I think that as we think about our engagement with those clients, as I mentioned also one of those clients really focused much of the year on their immediate needs to make sure that they were managing to capacity and resiliency in managing to current trading levels. And so if they were planning to do some enhancements or changes or upgrades, they kind of put those plans on hold. I think also, they know that as they go forward with those plans, they want to be able to have the right focus from their customers and their customers are also dealing with these elevated trading volumes. So, to put on them an upgrade in the middle of that, I think was also something they were hesitant to do. So as we exited 2020 and we are starting to \u2013 we are starting to see more engagement from those clients saying, we can't put these things off wherever and that's starting to engages us, but I would have to say still is not at the levels that we are experiencing before COVID I think last year. I think also some of the new markets clients that were very active and engaged with us are continuing to engage with some of them have hit funding issues or just as they are looking at launching their products or waiting until more normalized environment. So, those are the things that are \u2013 that's the color behind that. On the banks and broker side though and this actually plays into the Verafin question, we actually continue to see nice healthy engagement, healthy growth and also it's a SaaS based delivery. So, it's a much easier thing for the clients to take and to integrate, whether it's our surveillance or our trade execution solutions. And so that was \u2013 had a more, I would say more of a normal environment as well as some increased demand for surveillance as the clients went online went to the remote setting and they had to add users to make sure that they had proper coverage. I think that then plays into the Verafin question, which is there more aligned with the banks and brokers where it's a SaaS based cloud based delivery. So, it's the right implementation for the clients and they continued to have a lot of engagement with banks and brokers managing through their anti-financial crime program. So, they didn't see the same level of impact as we did see at the market infrastructure operator clients and I think that they had a solid entity here. So, we feel good about their progress and their momentum going into 2021. Sure. So I think that it's worth noting that of the 316 IPOs that we have last year, I believe, 184 of operating companies and we had \u2013 we were actually very proud of the fact we had an 82% or 86% win rate for this company's listings as well and then the remainder was back. And as we go into 2021, we are continuing to see a very healthy activity level in terms of listings of both operating companies and SPACs, particularly SPACs. But I think that when we look at our pipeline, we have a longer view of operating company potentials versus SPACs. SPACs tend to come to market quickly tend to engage with us quickly and we don't have as much line of sight. So, we probably really only have some level of understanding of the demand for SPACs in the first quarter. And then our line of sight really diminishes, I think with our operating companies who tend to have a little bit of a longer view. So, my answer to the question is that we have a very active pipeline in both SPACs and operating companies. And I would say, SPACs for the next several weeks probably and in terms of we don't see beyond that. And with operating companies, we certainly see a healthy pipeline through the first half of the year. And then we will have to see how the markets continue to develop. But as you know, the market and the performance of the market does have an impact on when companies tend to go out. So, assuming a benign market environment, we should have a pretty healthy first half. Well, I mean, for as many companies that are going public, there are still thousands of private companies. And as we said, even with a really active IPO environment last year, we had 90 private market programs and it was a record for us. So, I think that we shift in that there is just a lot of companies out there. Some of them are ready for the public markets and some are preferring to stay private and the great thing is that Nasdaq has the ability to serve both of them. Alright. So, first of all, we don't disclose specific revenue related to Nasdaq private market. It is part of the listing sub-segments that we don't separately disclose that. So we can make that available to you. But I would say that the nature of the revenue is primarily variable, you are correct. It's basically \u2013 you got paid for the programs that we execute on behalf of our clients, the tender program. So, it is not as recurring in nature as the listings business is, but the quantum of that is it's a very \u2013 it is a small percentage of our listings business overall, just to say. Sure. So, Michael, do you want to take the first part? Sure, yes. So as we engage with our clients, actually, their clients and our clients have been very positive. So I think that if we think about the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks that we serve with our anti-financial crime technology, particularly our surveillance technology, we have had a lot of good calls from clients saying want to learn more. It's just a product that could apply to us how are you going to integrate that in with your capital markets offering etcetera? So these are great questions to be getting from our customers before we even closed the deal. I think as we mentioned when we announced the deal, there is a journey to take with Verafin to continue to advance the product to get them ready to sever the largest banks in the world, but that is obviously our mission and our joint vision for the business. And so that will be an area, our significant area of investment and our primary area of investment is to continue to advance the platform to be able to serve the largest banks over time and that's a big part of why we bought it. So it's great to know that our clients are very interested in engaging with us from already. I think the second thing on their clients is I think they do appreciate us as a high integrity player we have obviously a strong presence in the market, we have a strong balance sheet, we have the ability to really manage the business together. And I think that they are very pleased with us as the partner to Verafin going forward. Sure. Yes, with the Market Abuse or what we call MARs, that is definitely been \u2013 it has been over the last few years, actually a good catalyst for our sales of our surveillance solutions to the brokerage community, and also as the buy-side has been managing through that change, it also definitely opens doors to conversations in sales for the cybernetics or what we're now calling our buy-side surveillance solution. We are making good traction with the buy-side surveillance solution in terms of sales, and it's been, I would say, that we've had a relatively good momentum year there. But it's still a very small part of our business. So \u2013 and it a small acquisition, and it continues to be an area where we are making sure we are tailoring it to the needs of the buy-side, I would say, that the original product was \u2013 is a great product, but wasn't quite tailored to what the buy-side specific needs were. So, we have spent the last couple of years really engaging with customers and making sure that we have a solution that really meets their needs, and now we've had more sales momentum. But it continues to be small, but we're optimistic there. Great. Thank you. Well, in closing, Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year of 2020 performance was solid and we are starting 2021 with strong momentum. And our leadership team remains focused on executing our technology led strategy to deliver for our stakeholders and I look forward to our continued discussions throughout the year on the progress that we will be making against those strategic priorities. So thank you very much for your time today."

            "name": "Michael Ptasznik",
            "content": "Thank you for those kind remarks, Adena and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $142 million increase in reported net revenue of $788 million is a net result of organic growth of $126 million, including a 27% organic increase in market services and a 16% organic increase in the solution segments, a $3 million dollar positive impact from acquisitions and a $13 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I start with investment intelligence revenue, which increased $53 million or 27%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 25%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and positive contributions from each of the market data and analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $560 million and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, revenues related to index AUM and futures trading are not included in the ARR definition. First quarter 2020 operating margin of 65% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period while the full year 2020 margin of 64% was 1 percentage point versus 2019. Now, looking forward to the first quarter of 2021 for index, trading activity of instruments licensed to our indexes achieved certain thresholds earlier in the year. That triggered an increase in licensing economics in the third and fourth quarters of 2020. While the confidentiality of our index agreements limits the detail we can provide on this, what we can say is that as we begin 2021, the economics of some of the agreements reset for the new year and this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This assumes similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. Turning to market technology, revenue increased $8 million or 8%. Organic revenue growth totaled $4 million or 4% and there was a positive $4 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase was driven primarily by higher SaaS revenues. ARR was $283 million and increased 9% compared to the prior-year period. The operating margin was a negative 1% in the period and was impacted by the previously mentioned $25 million reserve related to the expected loss on the market technology implementation project. Excluding the reserve, the operating margin was 23% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 24% in the prior-year period and 16% for the full year 2020 unchanged from 2019. Corporate platforms revenues increased $15 million, or 12%. Organic revenue growth totaled $13 million or 10% and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in foreign exchange. Organic revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in U.S. listings revenues, increases in ESG Services revenues and growth in Nasdaq private market. ARR was $470 million, and increased 9% compared to the prior year period. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating margin of 31% for this segment was down from 35% in the prior-year period. The decrease in the operating margin was primarily due to higher variable compensation and marketing expenses during the period in support of a very strong IPO activity. For the full year 2020, the corporate platforms operating margin was 36%, unchanged from 2019. Market services net revenues increased $66 million, or 29%. The organic revenue increase was $60 million or 27% and there was a $6 million impact from changes in foreign exchange. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and U.S. equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. For the fourth quarter 2020, market services operating margin of 61%, increased 6 percentage points from 55% in the prior-year period and full year 2020 margin of 62% was 5 percentage points higher than 2019, each comparison reflecting strong operating leverage on the higher trading revenues. Now, earlier today, Nasdaq Clearing received the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority's or SFSAs decision following their supervisory review initiated after the member default following the extreme market movement on our Nordic commodities market in September of 2018. The SFSA decided to issue a warning and an administrative fine of approximately $36 million. Nasdaq Clearing has been cooperating throughout the investigation with the regulator and maintains a constructive working relationship with the SFSA. Immediately following the event and independent of the SFSA review, Nasdaq Clearing launched a comprehensive enhancement program to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the clearinghouse. We are comfortable that the program effectively addresses the observations made by the SFSA in their review. While the SFSA recognize the changes made by the clearinghouse, our initial review indicates that the findings appear to be disproportionate to the severity and impact of the incident and to the size of the commodities business that the clearinghouse serves. We are continuing to review the decision and evaluating our legal options and we'll communicate any next steps to our members and the broader public in due course. Now, turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $71 million to $406 million. The increase reflects a $53 million, or 16% organic increase inclusive of the $25 million reserve related to market technology. Excluding the reserve, the organic increase was $28 million, or 8% as compared to the total organic revenue growth of 20%. The increase was also due to a $6 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $12 million increase from the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. As noted in our January 12 press release, the full year 2020 non-GAAP operating expenses of $1.41 billion were above the high-end of our prior guidance range due to three primary factors. First, higher performance compensation and variable expenses related to higher-than-expected fourth quarter 2020 revenues associated with elevated trading volumes, a quarterly record in assets under management in licensed ETPs and a multi-decade high in the number of Nasdaq IPOs; second, the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates; and third, the $25 million reserve related to the expected loss of the Market Technology implementation project. On that last item, I will spend a moment explaining the accounting aspect of the reserve. The accounting for highly customized software system delivery contracts, such as certain of our Market Technology contracts requires us to record a loss in the quarter when it becomes probable that costs will exceed future revenues from the contract. During the fourth quarter, as part of our regular review of significant implementation projects, we refined and revised our plans relating to a large-scale post-trade clearing implementation project for a specific client. In that process, it became probable that we would incur a loss over the remainder of that particular project in part due to the logistical implications of COVID-19. As a result, we recorded the $25 million reserve that reflects the expected loss. Turning to Slide 10, we are initiating our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range of $1.55 billion to $1.62 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint reflects an approximate 3% organic increase compared to 2020 excluding the $25 million reserve on the Market Tech contract. An additional approximate 3% increase due to changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as expenses due to the net impact of M&A. The guidance does reflect the anticipated closing of Verafin acquisition in the first quarter of 2021. Now, moving to operating profits and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the fourth quarter 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin of 48% was unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the $25 million reserve, the non-GAAP operating margin would have been 52% in the fourth quarter, up 400 basis points versus the prior year. Net interest expense was $24 million in the fourth quarter 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior-year period. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 26% for the full year 2020. For the full year of 2021, we expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25% and 27%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq in the fourth quarter 2020 was $268 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, compared to $215 million, or $1.29 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt increased by $1.97 billion versus September 30, 2020, primarily due to bond issuances of $1.88 billion in December and an $89 million increase in our outstanding Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. The proceeds of the December offering are expected to be used to partially finance the Verafin acquisition, along with additional borrowings of approximately $500 million prior to the closing of the transaction. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.5 times, an increase from 2.4 times from the third quarter of 2020. During the fourth quarter 2020, the Company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $36 million. And during 2020, the Company also repurchased common stock in the amount of $222 million. Now, I'd like to provide a brief update on the acquisition of Verafin. We continue to progress through the regulatory approval process and expect Verafin to close in the first quarter of 2021. As a reminder, we are projecting in excess of $140 million in Verafin revenue for the full year of 2021. This will need to be adjusted for both the actual closing date, as well as the impact of an accounting writedown of deferred revenue. We currently estimate this purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue to total $35 million, which will impact recognized revenues over the 12-month period following the close. The acquisition of Verafin is expected to deliver non-GAAP EPS accretion beginning in 2022 and increase thereafter. And I'll remind investors and analysts that Nasdaq's organic growth calculation reflects contributions from acquired businesses beginning 12 months after close, and as such, Verafin will be included in organic growth beginning in the first quarter of 2022. Finally, as Adena mentioned, this will be my 73rd consecutive and last quarterly call before retirement. I want to take a moment to thank my incredible team and outstanding colleagues for all their extensive efforts, contributions and kindness during my time here at Nasdaq. I also want to thank Adena for her exceptional and principled leadership. It has been an honor and an education working for Adena and our esteemed Board of Directors. I also want to express my appreciation and gratitude to you, the investors and analysts with whom I've had the pleasure and privilege of working with over the years. And I especially want to thank my family for allowing me the time to pursue my career and I'm very much looking forward to be able to repay them some of that time, whether they want it or not, over the coming years. As I said on the last call, I could not be more excited that Ann will be taking hold of the CFO reigns. I've so enjoyed working with her, she is a person of integrity, intelligence and initiative who I am confident will serve this organization with excellence. Ann, I look forward to you breaking my quarterly record as CFO of an exchange group and I will definitely hologram into the Q2 2039 investor call when that occurs. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes, Rich, the \u2013 I can't go into too much detail, but basically, the way the contract works is that there are certain elevation points in the contract. And so what we want to basically try to say is that some of those reset at the beginning of each year and so depending on activity and on a comparable basis then Q1 of 2021 if it has the same mix and the same trading activity as compared to Q4, there will be a $7 million decrease in the run rate for that \u2013 in the amount for that period in Q1. Does that answer that question? Okay, great. Yes, thanks Adena. So, on Verafin, we said consistently what we said when we announced the transaction that the 2021 revenue we would anticipate to be in excess of $140 million. But there is the couple of adjustments and the first adjustment is that obviously we will have to adjust that for the timing of the closing which we do anticipate to be in Q1. So, the 140 is a full year number and so we just have to prorate that accordingly for the amount and once we close the transaction. Secondly, we currently estimate that the purchase price address from either deferred revenue which will be reflected in our results will come off of that $140 million or the prorated $140 million in the first year as well. And so we estimate that there will be a $35 million reduction to that adjusted number in the first year of results. Well, it's technically over the first 12 months or so and again, we are finalizing the adjustments, we will be able to provide more updates on that in the next quarter results. So we will be able to fine tune that number a little better, but it's over the first 12 months. So, it could flow into 2022, but only really through Q1 since we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter. Thank you very much for the questions. Yes. Just the actual number was $7 million for the quarter, Alex in the market data and again, really it's coming from sales of the product to new clients is one of the big drivers of the market data business. Yes, I think we said that last quarter that we wouldn't necessarily provide that on a regular basis going forward. And so the two-thirds numbers is the number to keep in mind. Well, I think if you look historically, that is very consistent that the fourth quarter from a seasonality standpoint is the highest and it really is driven by change requests, even if things are later this year relative to others in the full year concept on a full year basis relative to Q3, Q4 is always the highest quarter. Sure. Thanks, Ari. So, the 3% of FX is really a combination of the weakening of the dollar relative to the SEK and the euro. And we \u2013 in the guidance that we provided, we are really looking at kind of current spot rates is how we develop those estimates and that's where we come up with the delta there, but it has been fairly significant relative to the average for last year. And then there is always ability to make some level of adjustments. I think it's important that we want to continue to invest in the business and continue to grow it for the future, which is where a lot of our investments are is to build those new products and capabilities. But obviously, if they are \u2013 as you saw the fourth quarter where we had some increases in marketing spend and some other comp related items then periods where things were slowed down, then there are certain factors that will adjust accordingly, but I don't want to take away from the required investment going forward. Yes, sure. So we are breaking out that Verafin explicitly, but what I can do is reiterate the comments we made when we announced the acquisition which was that Verafin was offering about 26% EBITDA margin and so you can take that into account and estimate the amount that you will put towards Verafin and then obviously you have to adjust it for the year. So, then Adena, the remainder?"

I'm pleased to report NASDAQ\u2019s financial results for the third quarter of 2020. With our strategic ambitions as our guide, we have been consistently focused on delivering results for our clients while creating sustainable value for our stakeholders. Our global workforce has demonstrated their nimbleness and ability to remain highly productive and available to our clients throughout this period. That focus is reflected in today's strong results where we are seeing significant contributions from across our franchise. My remarks today will focus on business unit highlights and strategic initiatives from the third quarter. I will then touch on today's announcement about Michael's decision to retire and then Michael will cover the financials. Nasdaq delivered another quarter of strong performance driven by great efforts by our team, coupled with stapled favorable market conditions. Here are some of the highlights. We welcome to 105 IPOs of Nasdaq during the period which represents the highest number of IPOs for quarter on a U.S. exchange in the past decade. Conviction by investors to increase exposure to Nasdaq\u2019s focus, semantic indexes, coupled with rigorous market performance continued to support our expanding index business. As a result, we saw the AUM in our index products achieve another quarter of record highs alongside high trading activity and Nasdaq license index derivatives. Our market infrastructure performed exceptionally well during the peaks of volatility we observed earlier this year, particularly in March and April. We continued to experience strong volumes across our equities and options businesses in the third quarter, and we've continued to invest to enable us to have capacity for future volatility as markets react to continually changing dynamics in the U.S. and globally. Our Data & Analytics business within information services as well as our market technology business continue to demonstrate their resilience with healthy growth in annualized recurring revenue or ARR market tech and targeted sales and new capabilities and products across our product suite. We were pleased to announce the launch of several new products during the period including the cloud-deployed Nasdaq Automated Investigator, or anti-money laundering or AML to SaaS solution for investigating financial crime for retail commercial banks and other financial institutions. And in our licensed index futures business, we announced together with CME Group two innovative index products; a new futures contracts on the Nasdaq 100 volatility index known as \u201cVOLQ\u201d and the first ever water index futures based on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index. Early in October, we also announced an expansion of our partnership with Invesco for our Nasdaq 100 products suite, including a new Nasdaq next-gen 100 index ETF. Our results for the third quarter highlights the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offerings and business model while operating in a unique capital markets environments in 2020. Our ability to execute against the significant demand and logistical challenges of COVID-19 enabled us to continue on our strategic journey and bring these new and innovative technology and index solutions to our clients. Now I will turn to our strong results for the third quarter of 2020. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $715 million, an increase of $83 million, or 13% from the prior year period, driven almost entirely by an organic growth. Net revenues and our market services business grew 15% while revenues in our non-trading segments rose 12% from the prior year period. Operating leverage was particularly strong with non-GAAP operating margin expanding nearly 200 basis points to 52% and contributing to the non-GAAP EPS growth of 20%. Turning now to specific highlights from the third quarter, starting with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our market services segments saw net revenues of $259 million, a 15% increase from the prior year period led by 35% increase in cash equity net revenues, as well as strong growth in both the equity derivatives and trade management services businesses. While of course, industry volumes were a main contributor to this performance, I do want to bring attention to the strong competitive positioning that market services has established and which continued in the third quarter. In particular, we have enjoyed relatively stable market share in U.S. equities in areas where we feature the single largest liquidity pool with the Nasdaq stock market, the largest of our three equities exchanges. Additionally, our Nordic equity franchise with a 77% share on exchange trading was up nearly 500 basis points year-over-year. And in our U.S. options trading complex, we continue to lead the industry with a 37% share of mostly listed options. The elevated volumes we've experienced are the results of both high investor engagement and a multitude of macro and geopolitical uncertainties. While the activity levels can change quickly, we believe that the U.S. Presidential election remains a big focus for investors, and we anticipate our set of marketplaces are likely to continue to contribute at a high level as we progress through the final quarter of the year. Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenues of $132 million; a 6% increase boosted by new listing activity and continued demand for our governance and investor relations intelligence solutions. In our listings, and our listing services business Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 105 IPOs for 79% win rate for operating company listings and an overall win rate of 65% when including stocks. We are proud to welcome GoodRX, Li Auto, Jamf Holding Corp and nCino as just a few of the highlight listings from the quarter. Our quarterly win rate of Saas [ph] has also been rising from 30% in the second quarter to 51% in the third quarter. In addition, we were honoured to welcome to six companies who have switched their listings from the New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq during the period with an aggregate global market capitalization of $187 billion, including AstraZeneca and Keurig Dr. Pepper. This brings our cumulative exchange swiss market cap to over $1.8 trillion since 2005, with over $1 trillion of that value switching in just the last five years. When it came to their decision to switch exchanges, these issues, issuers identified strongly with the innovative spirit of Nasdaq's listing platform with the expanding community of listed issuers recognizing the opportunity to leverage our IR and governance solutions to improve how they engage with critical stakeholders. And lastly for the larger switches to potentially increase their representation in the Nasdaq family of indexes by qualifying for the Nasdaq 100. In the third quarter, corporate services revenue grew 6% with a balanced contribution from both governance and IR solutions. We are pleased that rising secular demand for insights that help companies better understand and engage the shareholders is more than offsetting the impact of spending reductions by companies and sectors more negatively impacted by COVID-19. We believe that our successes during the quarter underscore how Nasdaq continues to be the destination exchange and partner of choice for companies worldwide with unparalleled expertise across equity markets, investor relations and governance. Now let me turn to our information services and technology businesses. In our information services segment, we delivered net revenues of $238 million up $40 million, or 20% from the prior year period. Index AUM rose to $313 billion versus $207 billion in the prior year period up 51%. While contract volumes in the Nasdaq license index futures that trade on the CME rose by more than 90%. Each of these contributed meaningfully to the index revenue rising $30 million or 54% year-over-year. While the NASDAQ 100 family of indexes has had market appreciation materially above the broader market averages 30% -- 37% of the increase in AUM year-over-year came from positive organic investor inflows and we're working with our partners to meet rising investor interest in Nasdaq thematic indexes in several ways. For example, as I stated earlier in my remarks, just last week, Invesco introduced the QQQ Innovation Suite in partnership with Nasdaq, giving a wider population of investors access to the Nasdaq 100 index for a variety of investment structures, and providing exposure to the Nasdaq next-gen 100 index through a new ETF. Additionally, we launched VOLQ, a new futures contract on the Nasdaq 100 volatility index, and announced plans to launch a futures contract based on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index. Our investment data and analytics revenues increased 13% from the prior year period driven both by the incorporation of syllabus and the organic growth in our leading institutional asset allocation solutions. Market data rose 5% with contributions from across our North American and European proprietary products as well as the tape plan revenue. Growth during the period was driven by new sales and increased -- retail investor usage worldwide, particularly in new geographies, like Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition, this area of the business saw new customer expansion and new product launches driven by the launch of the Nasdaq cloud data service, a service that we believe provides significant technical cost reductions, and quick [Indiscernible] time for market for clients seeking real time data solutions. Lastly, our market technology segments delivered $86 million in revenue and sized $84 million in new order intake. ARR in the quarter was $278 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. However, total revenue rose only nominally in the third quarter compared to prior year as the growth in the more stable SaaS subscription and recurrent licensing fees that comprise our ARR was offset by lower non-recurring revenues associated with new service implementations and change requests. As we stated earlier in 2020, service implementation change request projects, new order intake levels and funding for new markets and new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by the pandemic related factors. We continue to expect to see in the short term mostly logistical growth headwinds that underpin the risk of market technology being below the bottom of our medium term growth objectives for the current year. We have taken actions that we hope will mitigate pressures on our non-recurring market technology revenues in the coming period. For example, we've developed new ways in improving execution for important project phases in a completely virtual environment. And we've increased hiring and technology staff as part of an effort to quicken the pace of our full slate of existing implementations to their production phases. To increase technology faster, manage large projects and deliver projects, it's had an impact on the short term margins and we are managing this expense increase carefully as we continue to be focused on driving margin expansion as the business continues to grow. Taking a step back and the near term impact of the pandemic, our conviction has not changed about the medium to long term opportunity for market technology. A major component of this strategy is our commitment to operating and providing best-in-class stock solutions across the transaction lifecycle. Our marketplace services platform, which launched in June gives clients the complete transaction lifecycle functionality on a single platform and we've seen positive response in growth and demand for the platform over the quarter. In 2020 year-to-date, we've increased the count of sales to entirely new clients, the vast majority of which have chosen to implement our next generation SaaS enabled services. Specifically, we signed eight new market infrastructure operator clients through our SaaS offerings and we've signed 12 new trade surveillance clients so far this year. We've also had solid success in expanding our existing client relationships in our trade surveillance business. We look forward to updating you both in addressing the near term challenges we're navigating as well as our progress and ramping adoption of our next generation products and services in the coming period. Now, let me take a moment to address today's announcements as Mike will be retiring in early 2021 after a very distinguished 30-year financial services career. Michael joined Nasdaq in 2016 as CFO to lead a dynamic team responsible for Finance, Treasury, Strategy, Investor Relations facilities and risk management. His extensive operational expertise and industry reputation for strategic thinking, creative resource management, and managing through a competitive and evolving landscape made him a perfect fit for us during what has been an especially important phase in our growth as a company. Michael has been an invaluable member of the executive leadership team during this time at Nasdaq. He played a particularly important role in our management team strategic review of our business in 2017 after which we realigned our vision, mission and corporate strategy to embrace our core strengths in data analytics and technology, our strategic pivot as we refer to it. Michael has since played an instrumental role in the execution of that strategic pivot. For example, he worked closely with me to establish a clear, consistent capital deployment and return framework, including an annual review of our business portfolio, and effectively manage the balance sheet to improve liquidity and lower borrowing costs. Michael has been a wonderful partner to our business unit leaders, bringing creative ideas as well as a structured approach across business unit initiatives. He has worked extensively with our business units to evaluate and execute on organic and inorganic opportunities, and he oversaw the launch and development of our Venture Investment Group. Michael has been an outstanding CFO bringing focus, drive, creativity and determination to his role every day. And on behalf of the entire team at Nasdaq and the board of directors, I want to thank you Michael for his leadership and dedication to our company into our values. When Michael retires at the end of February next year, I'm very pleased to announce that Ann Dennison, who currently serves as Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ann join Nasdaq in 2015 and since 2017, she's been leading an extensive multi-year modernization of the company's financial operations infrastructure. These efforts include Nasdaq's migration to a modern financial consolidation and reporting system leveraging workday financials, the introduction of a new enterprise resource planning platform and surrounding systems and the development of a corporate data strategy and intelligent automation programs that are delivering interesting insights and powerful efficiencies. Additionally, Ann added to her responsibilities in 2017, when she took on leadership with a financial planning and analysis team, which partners with the business units and expertise to develop to maintain our detailed forecasts and budgets. And as a dedicated leader with a deep understanding of our business and our long term vision, she has made significant contributions to Nasdaq's financial soundness in her five years with the company, and her diligence and expertise will be important factors in our growth strategy. With her combination of experience and leadership skills, as well as her thorough knowledge of Nasdaq's business and financial operations, and is the obvious and best choice to become assets next CFO. I'm excited for our analysts and investors to meet Ann in the coming months as Michael and Ann work together to transition the role between now and the end of February. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that we are very pleased with the strong results we delivered in the third quarter and we've remained focused on advancing our strategic mission. Our results highlight the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model, capitalizing both on opportunities presented by this year's unique capital markets backdrop, including elevated trading volumes, rising index valuations and strong IPO issuance. We believe that our ability to execute against the significant demand and the logistical challenges of COVID-19 has enabled us to continue on our journey, while prudently advancing as a technology and analytics provider. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank you, Adena for those kinds of remarks, and good morning everyone. I will first provide comments on the quarter and then a few remarks about my decision to retire. My commentary on the quarter will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in our file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance as shown on page three of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages four and 14. The $83 million increase in reported net revenue of $715 million is a net result of organic growth of $70 million, including 13% organic increase in market services, and 10% organic growth in the non-trading segments, a $4 million positive impact from acquisitions and a $9 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with information services, which as reflected on pages five and 14 saw a $40 million or 20% increase in revenue, excluding a positive $3 million impact from the acquisition of Solovis and a $1 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic revenue growth during this period was 18%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and positive contributions from each of the investment data and analytics and market data businesses. Operating margin of 65% increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. Market technology revenue as shown on pages six and 14 increased $2 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting a positive $3 million impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. On our organic basis, revenue decreased by $1 million, or 1% as the increase in software as a surveillance service -- surveillance revenues were more than offset by lower software delivery and support revenues and lower change requests and advisory revenues. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. Operating margin of 10% in the period was down eight percentage points from 18% in the prior year, putting margin into a 12-month context, which eliminates quarter-to-quarter volatility from seasonality and other factors the trailing 12-month margin is 16% in line with full year 2019 level. As Adena noted, progress has been impacted by the pandemic induced near term growth headwinds. However, we continue to expect margin improvement as the business expands over time. Turning to Corporate Services on pages seven and 14, revenues increased $8 million, or 6%. Organic revenue growth was $6 million or 5%, reflecting an increase in U.S. listings revenues and increases in both governance solutions and IR intelligence revenues. The operating margin of 39% for the segment was up 300 basis points from the prior year period. Market services net revenues on pages eight and 14 saw $33 million or 15% increase. Excluding the positive $4 million impact for favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, the organic revenue increase was $29 million or 13%. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash, equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. The operating margin of 59% for the segment increased two percentage points year-over-year. Turning to pages nine and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $29 million to $346 million. The increase reflects a $17 million or 5% organic increase, a $7 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $5 million increase from an unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The organic growth and expenses primarily reflects higher compensation expense, professional fees and infrastructure costs partially offset by lower travel and event spending. Turning to slide 10, we are adjusting our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.36 billion to $1.37 billion, up from $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion previously. The revised range is driven by two factors; first, changes in foreign exchange rates, and particularly the weakening of the U.S. dollar as manifested in a $10 million increase in the top end of our guidance range. Second, as we've continued to deliver especially strong organic growth in both of our trading and non-trading segments, higher expenses, including accruals of performance based compensation, make us increasingly likely to end up at the high end of our expense guidance range. That's a full year context. The $1.37 billion high end of our revised expense guidance range implies a 4% organic increase in expenses. While in the first nine months of 2020, the company delivered organic revenue growth of 12%. And moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $54 million in the third quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 52% compared to 50% in the prior year period. Net interest expense was $24 million in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26% for the third quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2020 was $256 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, compared to $212 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to slide 11, debt increased by $89 million versus June 30, primarily due to an increase in the Euro bonds book value caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period of 2.4 times and changed from 2.4 times at the end of Q2. During the third quarter of 2020, the company paid a dividend in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $34 million. The company has repurchased $186 million year-to-date through September 30, largely completing our objective to use share repurchases to offset deletion of equity compensation, and other sources of gross issuances. And before I turn it back for the Q&A session, a few comments about my decision to retire. Why was the decision I've contemplated for a while now, it certainly comes with mixed emotions. It has been such an honor and a privilege to work for Adena, the board and this incredible company. And I am extremely excited about the vision and strategy and the great opportunities that we have ahead of us to continue to grow and expand as a technology company, serving the capital markets and beyond. Most importantly, I'm fortunate to work with colleagues who are enormously intelligent, innovative driven, and are just good people that consistently exemplify Nasdaq's values of integrity and teamwork. However, I've been in an exchange industry now for a long time going back to the 90s when exchanges were mutual broker owned not for profits. And while I can't say for certain, I do believe, I hold the record for the most consecutive quarterly conference calls as CFO of an exchange group, with this call being my 72nd in a row. And that's why the decision was so difficult. For those of you who like me are Canadian, I'm sure you'll recall the ubiquitous early retirement inducing freedom 55 commercials; I will undoubtedly understand the indelible target that left on my psyche. In finance, we forecast macroeconomics, revenues and earnings. But the one thing that no one can forecast and COVID has certainly been a great reminder of this is the time and capability will be given to enjoy the fruits of our labors. Thankfully, I have no current health concerns, but the point is, you just never know. So despite the temptation to stay and partake in the exciting initiatives and growth we have in front of us here at Nasdaq, I've decided to stick with the five year timeframe that I shared with Adena and importantly my family, when I first accepted this position. What does make my decision easier is that my knowledge of the strength of the team I am leaving behind, and I could not be more pleased that Ann Dennison will be taking on the CFO role. Ann has been a key member of my management team per technical expertise, proven ability to drive change through innovation and her collaborative approach to problem solving make her the ideal candidate for this position. She's also an absolute pleasure to work with and is always focused on doing what's best for the organization. I am confident that she's the right person to help drive Nasdaq. So there will be plenty of time next quarter to say proper thank yours, to the board and to Adena, to all my colleagues past and present and to you, the investors and analysts. At this point, I will just say it has been an honor and privilege to work for and with all of you. So now I like to just drop the mic and walk away. But I think we have to turn to Q&A session now. So I'll turn it back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Michael and Michael. Michael, despite that elegant explanation, you're still too young to retire, we think. No, I'm kidding. Congrats, and you've done a great job. Anyway, so my question is first, on the information services on the index revenue, some nice upside surprise. I guess Adena or Michael, can you give us a better feel for how the breakout, we see that the revenue grew by more than 50%. But the futures and options volumes grew almost double. So can you just give some more colors, how we can model this a little bit better, given your agreements with the CMA, and also the license, AUM that grew by over 50% as well. So how do you sort of model this a little bit better than what we have?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So thanks Rich. I think that the first thing I noticed. We've kind of given you a little bit of a guidance in the past to say that, that the index futures revenue kind of ranges from 10% to 20% of the overall revenues for the index business. And it's obviously ebbs and flows based on volume. So it's not we can't give you a precise percentage every quarter, but this quarter, it was 21%. So it's just at the top end of that or just above the top end of that range. And I think that that shows you the strength of the fact that we have a great relationship with CME and I think that we have a long term partnership with them and, and the indexes that we have to -- 100 for CME is particularly strong index this year, and one where we see a lot of investor appetite to invest in ETFs and the products as well as to use the futures markets to help hedge and manage their portfolios.\nRich Repetto: Okay, that's my, I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping again you could expand upon your comments on the market tech side, obviously, the short term dynamics around some of the headwinds with revenue. But if we think about the 4Q sequential build that typically happens in that segment, how we should think about in the context of this year?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I think that it can kind of break down what we were trying to convey. The first is that they are ARR growth, which is really the recurring revenue streams that comes from our newer offerings that are SaaS oriented as well as trade [ph] for balanced business which is SaaS oriented. When those continue to see, you're seeing continued growth at 9% growth and we can continue to see that that will be a strong part of our franchise. And I think that we should recognize also that, that those types of implementations are more simple. They're just, they don't take as long to, to put a bring a company into the market, whether it's the marketplace services platform, or to bring them on to our trade surveillance or market surveillance platform. It's a, it's a bigger project, where we still do significant on-prem deliveries, where this year, we've definitely seen more of an impact of that. And if you think about it is there's a lot of collaboration that needs to go on between us and the client on so that particularly in the post trade deliveries, and we have several post rate deliveries that we're working on at the moment. And the pandemic made it harder to have that collaboration and it kind of created some, some challenges in terms of keeping up the pace of the original delivery schedule. And we've gotten, we've gotten better at that as we've gone through the year. And the clients also have gotten more used to it as well. But that I think definitely created some challenges. And then also just making sure that in order for us to make sure we're managing the pace of those, we have been making some increases in the tech team to make sure that we can deliver against that in this kind of constrained environment. And those are, those are short term issues. And those are the types of revenues that are non-recurring because they are delivery revenues. But they are, they continue to be an important part of the business. And then on change requests, it's really a matter of our ability. We actually have the capacity to implement change requests when the clients are looking for them. But when they're not, we obviously apply those people to the implementation projects. But we also are finding that clients are making change requests for sure, but just have a lower demand for those this year, because they're managing through other issues in their own organization. So I think you should assume those are shorter term trends that are really driven by the current environment, against the nice long term trend in terms of us increasing the percentage of sales that we're getting through SaaS, as well as continuing to move more of our products into a more flexible delivery mode with NFS. So I think I'm hoping that gives you an enough backdrop.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeremy Campbell with Barclays. Your line is open.\nJeremy Campbell: Hey, thanks. And Michael, just want to say congratulations. I know you still have a few months left, but it\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. And best of luck. You know, quick question on asset manager consolidation. It seems it\u2019s up a bit over the past year, and reportedly the pipeline is pretty active right now. I know asset managers are kind of a major client base of Nasdaq in different parts of the ecosystem. But how should we think about the pluses and minuses of asset manager consolidation as it relates to your non-recurring revenue stream at Nasdaq, and could like some of this post deal integration be another potential near term headwinds from market tech?\nAdena Friedman: Well, on the asset manager\u2019s side, we don't actually have a lot of asset managers and clients in the market tech business. We tend to really focus in on market infrastructure operators, as well as broker dealers. And we do have a small business that we've been growing in the surveillance business formed by clients. So I think market tech won't, asset manager consolidation will be a significant issue there. And then if you look over in the information services business, we have thousands of asset manager clients. And so you are seeing, an occasional combination and that's where we also work with them to figure out if they're, let's say, both of the clients are investment clients, then we'll work with them to figure out well, what is the overall enterprise value going forward, that they should, they should, that we should be able to charge for investment on a combined basis versus a single basis. It's really a matter of us working with the clients on that. And certainly, if the client, one client is an investment client and the other one is not, then we have a chance of actually increasing our penetration in that client as they combine. So I think that's the way to look at it for the investment business. And same with areas like [Indiscernible] and others were which are still very small and growing. There's just a huge sea, as you know, of asset managers out there, it's for us to appeal to. On the trading side of the business, I don't anticipate that that will have a real impact because they're basically just managing more AUM with their trading organization, and that shouldn't have a significant impact on how much they're trading and how they're managing their portfolio. So I don't see an impact on the trading side.\nJeremy Campbell: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey, good morning, everyone. This may be better for the investor day, but I do want to ask about M&A. You have clearly established a pretty strong track record here over the last years partially helped by Michael and you obviously as well, but if I look into next year, rates are low, 2021 is going to face a really tough comp on the trading side and on the index side. And your multiple has expanded substantially. So I'm just wondering, is this -- are you thinking differently about maybe bigger deals in the space? And if so, to what degree would you actually look at something that has a little bit more transactional revenues with it? And where there could be more of a cost driven value proposition? So maybe a broad update on M&A would be great here. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. We will spend a little bit more time on that in the Investor Day, Alex. So I think it is an area that will at least give you a sense of our focus areas. But I'll give you a little bit rough preview. I think what we've said all along is that we look at acquisitions as part of fitting into our strategy. So we don't just look at every acquisition out there. Optimistically, we have really developed a strategic nexus around where we want to grow and how we want to grow, and where we think that we can do everything organically and where we might benefit from acquisition sector to catalyze growth and/or expand our clientele. And I think that the areas that we have been primarily focused on, we've said this many times, is an expanding our Architect business and expanding our Information Services business in terms of growth to you're part of the sector of the industry. And then on the on the marketplace -- in the marketplaces, I think that we would make targeted acquisitions if it really makes sense in terms of both synergies on the cost side. And so therefore the ability to generate scale, but also that it furthers our strategy in the asset classes where we're really strong. But -- and all I can say is that, we looked at a lot of things. We do always put them within the strategic framework, so that we also stop looking at things on pretty quickly if it doesn't really fit in. And we will certainly not shy away from doing the right transactions that further our strategy. But that hasn't changed. We aren't not shifting our strategy from what we've been seeing over the last few years. So we'll spend a little more time on that at the Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. And Congrats, Michael also. And we'll talk to you for another quarter, but I just want to say, congrats. So just on the sustainability of that Information Services revenue, extremely strong this quarter. Looks like it's easy for you to now exceed the top of the 5% to 7% range even with the softness in Market Tech. But as we look at that Info Services moving into the fourth quarter and into next year, obviously, depending on volumes at T&E in your contracts and ETF, AUM levels, but it seems like there would still be an upward trajectory in that line. So just maybe some commentary about that? And to what extent, any audit fees positively impacted the market data. And then just thoughts about market data revenue coming into 2021, with consolidation, say in the online brokerage industry, for example, with Schwab and Ameritrade, and your ability to recoup that cost?\nAdena Friedman:\n,: So, we do think that there's just a strong secular interest and appetite among investors to invest in the Nasdaq-100, the Biotech index, Semiconductor, other automatic indexes, in addition to our smart beta franchise. And then, we've seen that through both this kind of upward market swing, but also even in March, the largest inflow week that we had was the toughest market week, as the markets were declining the most, that's when we saw something like $4 million or $5 million of inflows into the Nasdaq-100. So, we just think that the indexes that we have are more align with long term themes. But I also would say, there is obviously some beta components there and on the trading. We are making sure that we continue to generate growth there by launching new products and making sure we gathering AUM into those products as well. And that will be a testament to our ability to do that over the next several years to continue to expand that franchise. With regard to the market data business, we are continuing -- I think the one thing that this year is shown, it's a very resilient business. And we have done a nice job of diversifying the clientele, which earlier in the year, we mentioned, could create some challenges just in terms of clients who are -- some of the newer clients in other parts of the world. But actually, we found that we continue to see really strong demand from those clients to continue to provide and expand the data that they're providing to investors around the world. So that's showing up in the numbers. And in fact, our audit revenue this quarter is significantly down from last year third quarter. And our audit revenue for the year is down from last year. So we're actually not collecting as much on the backfilling. We're really driving the growth that we're seeing this quarter is really just from pure new customers, and obviously, the expansion of our current clients. In terms of the consolidation and the impact from the online brokers, there will be some impact from that. And we've been -- we've known that for a long time. The nice thing is that it takes a long time of close these deals. So we've had a lot of time to work with this clients and continue to make sure that they're taking all the products that they can take from us as they become a combined organization. But we do also see continued strong demand coming from New FinTech clients. And so, I think that there's a nice balance there. But we've always said that that is a low to medium term -- I mean, low to mid single digit grower because it's a more mature part of our business. So hopefully that gives you more context.\nMichael Ptasznik: And Brian, the audit number was $2 million in the quarter compared to as an unusually high quarter of nine in Q3 of 2019.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you so much for all the color. Really appreciate it.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Good quarter. Just wanted to get an update on regulation. Given the DOJ [ph] working with the SEC on some areas like big market data. Just wanted to get your take on particularly from a process standpoint on how this is potentially different versus typical SEC process, meeting what to expect? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, to be honest, we're reading about that the same way you are. So, I hope that you must to understand that there's nothing that -- we're reading at the same time you're reading it. So I think that the things -- that is the one thing I would like to say. And secondly, I think that we've been able to demonstrate multiple times over a decade, that we have a highly competitive market model that our products are subject to competition in the data space. And that we provide a great value for investors and participants alike in the market data that we provide. And I think we do it in a very responsible way. And I think we've proven that both to our customers. And we do have a very good relationship with our customers on the market data front despite some of the things that you see in the paper. But I have to say, behind the scenes, we continue to have very strong relationships across our clientele. As well as the fact that and in addition to that, we've had to defend ourselves several times now, both in a court like situation. And I think we've done. We've been able to prove ourselves over and over again, that this is a competitive space that we price our products competitively, and that we create great value for those people who use those data. So I think that, we remain very confident, Mike, in the way that we manage the business, as well as how we deliver products. And we're happy to engage with whoever wants to talk to us about that.\nMike Carrier: Okay. Make sense. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Okay. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So first of all, best of luck in the future and Deltas, Mike.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank you very much.\nOwen Lau: Yes. So for my question, could you please give us an update on the Nasdaq private market? Does and will spec impact the private market and change the way you look at this space? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: That's the first I've got that question. So first of all, Nasdaq private market continues to have solid activity this year. It has been lower this year in terms of the overall level of tenders that have been issued in the private market this year. But generally speaking, we continue to have good clientele and a strong service that we offer the private companies, and they're still taking advantage of managing their liquidity in the private space. But it's been a little bit, I would say, decelerated a little bit this year just based on, I think, really the volatility and understanding, and the way that people are entering their businesses. But if you're asking, I think, a broader question is, because of all of the different alternative ways that companies can now tap into the public market, are they going to continue to stay private longer? And I think that's a good longer term question that we're going to have to see play out. So, our company is going to tap into the public markets earlier in their lifecycle, which may make it so that they have less of a demand to tenders. I don't think we can know the answer to that right now. I think that we are obviously seeing a lot of growth companies, but still quite mature, quite full on in terms of their overall ability to tap the public markets. I mean, we're still seeing high valuations and strong performance companies coming into the public markets both respects and through a traditional IPOs, and it's been a very active year. But I also think that there are just thousands of private companies that will continue to mature in the private space before they tap the public markets. And so, I personally think that the private market will continue to have a huge opportunity. We're really frankly, barely scratching the surface of private company's liquidity right now. And so, we have a lot more we can do there. But it is a good question as to whether more companies will come out to the public market sooner, and I just don't know the answer yet.\nOwen Lau: That's very helpful. Thank you, Adena.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. Question for you around Market Tech again. So, understanding the near term margin dynamics could sort of fluctuate, but I was hoping you could spend a minute just kind of walking us through the framework for margin from an opportunity here over time. And what I'm really kind of trying to get it, it's kind of what's the incremental margin on the ARPs [ph] instead of the revenue growth that you've seen there? What's the incremental margin on some of the on-prem initiatives that you guys have? And really just kind of incremental margin on the new order intake? Not sure if those are the best three kind of buckets to tackle it, but something along those lines will be helpful? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I don't know, if I'll be able to answer that in detail today something, but we'll take it back and try to figure out how we can help with that as we get into Investor Day. I think that in terms of the margin dynamics, I think what we've been saying all along continues to be very much the case, which is, the more that we can move our clients into a SaaS offering. So whether it's market -- our market surveillance offering, as we've launched SaaS offering this year and we've seen strong pick up there. And that -- and our trade surveillance offering has always been SaaS. And those offerings definitely allow us to have a higher overall margin just because the implementation time is shorter. And it's a recurring revenue stream. And so it's just a different composition of revenue that delivers a stronger margin for us. Whereas with the on-prem implementations, we obviously manage to the margin that we think is the right way to go. But we do often do fixed price contracts there. So sometimes if implementation ends up being longer and more complex, it can make it like -- it can make it so that we end up having to put more resources to it, and that can have some margin impact in the short term on the implementation. And that's what's happening this year. But over time, I think the more we can show that we're -- the new sales for generating our NFS, which is a much more flexible platform, and SaaS driven and/or because some of the NFS deliveries are still on-prem, some are in are SaaS, as well as our surveillance business is all SaaS. So the more we can drive to that higher margin. And so it's up to us to show you that shift in the order intake and the type of order in take that we're taking in. And that's something that we want to make sure that we provide more context around at Investor Day in a few weeks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: Great. Thanks. Do you think the paradigm has changed for trading in U.S. equities and options? And really, I guess what I'm wondering is, whether you think the volumes that we're seeing in these markets are going to be sustainable? And why if so?\nAdena Friedman: I think that they're two key factors that in our opinion are taking volumes to different levels this year. One is just overall volatility and uncertainty. And that always makes it so that you've got investors that have more different opinions, right? So when there are investors that have different views on what could happen next and how the economy is going to progress, you have more volatility, because those opinions all get expressed in the market and that drives our volumes. But at the same time, we also have a lot more younger retail investors coming into the markets as well. And so, I think that has to do with the fact that we do have more engagement around from retail investors. And those retail investors coming into the market, also drive volume stock. Now, the question is, are those retail investors as stainable trends? And I think that as we've been listening to the online brokers speak about it. And we've been talking to our own clients about it. I think that there's a view that there is a new wave of investors that have come in on the backs of zero commissions, which takes down the friction in the market, and therefore increases overall access, as well as the fact that the macro environment has created some really strong investment opportunities for retail investors. And I think that that is a longer term trend and a healthy one and an exciting one. But I don't think every one of those retail investors will be here over the long term. But I think we are seeing a secular shift in getting more younger investors engaged in the market. And I think that could create a more sustainably higher trading environment than what we saw in 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe. But I think that time will tell. But that's our -- I think that's our overall view, just speaking with industry professionals who really understand the nature of the investors coming in.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. And just on the listings business, I know you cited the strong IPO market and some switches as well in the quarter. I guess, it's still a little bit surprising that revenues grew by $5 million sequentially given those initial listing fees are amortized over several years. So first part of the question, is there anything else to note that drove the increase there that's more one time in nature, or should this be sustainable? And the second part of the question, you're still priced below the NYC for certain tiers within that listings business, given the strength and the momentum, you're seeing in the business? And I know, you'd probably say, it's not necessarily because of low fees, because the value proposition. Just wondering, do you see potential for pricing tweaks as you look out over the next year or so? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, one thing just to note is that the amortization of the initial listing fees is really the fees that get amortized. That amortization schedule did change a bit a few years, a couple years ago. So it's a little shorter than it used to be. But you're right, that the initial listing fees do get amortized. And I think, Michael, its for IPOs, its still over two years or two to three.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes, it depends. It's two to four years is the timeframe. Yes. But we also did -- we also did have a -- there was some pricing that was taken at the beginning of the year on the sustaining fees as well. And that's flowing through. It's been flowing through all the quarters so far this year.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And so I would just say that, first of all, there are no kind of one time fees that are creating that increase in the quarter. It is really -- it just the nature of the strength of new issuance market coupled with the strength in our corporate solutions business. And those are recurring revenue streams. So I do -- I think that's important thing to say. But I think that because of the fact that new issuances have been high throughout the year, you're starting to see that compounding effect of that as we get more and more issuance -- issuers in the market. And then they then start to generate annual listing fees, which will then create a list going into 2021. So that's the good news is it is kind of really just coming from the strength of new issuances. I just wanted to make sure you know that the amortization schedule is a little different than it was a few years ago.\nKyle Voigt: Fair enough. And then just on the potential for pricing tweaks?\nAdena Friedman: Alright. Yes. So we are very prudent in the way that we manage our fees. We're very proud of the fact that we deliver a really strong value to our clients. And we never want to give our top clients any reason to even consider an alternative. And fees do play a role in that. I wouldn't say that it's -- you're right, it's not the reason they switched to Nasdaq. But it can be a door opener for them to consider. They're paying $500,000 to list on your and they're paying $160,000 to list here. And they're getting frankly, in our opinion a far superior service here. Then it allows us to open the door to a conversation and then work with them on all the other aspects of our value proposition to have them move over. So I would have to say, the key differential is a catalyst to conversations on switches. And for IPOs, we think that we offer fee structure that is a strong reflection of the value that we give to our clients. And I think its -- so, we feel good about how we tear our fees in the max that we charge. And we'll continue to make pricing changes periodically to reflect the increased investments we're making in the business. But we don't see a reason frankly, to make a big change in our fees at the top end.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey. Yes, my follow up was actually just answered on the listings. But very quickly, then maybe on index and other numbers question. You gave the, I guess, the trading contribution. Can you also give the AUM contribution, the exact number for this quarter?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I know it's -- Michael, you might have it more readily available. But I know within any given quarters, like 60% to 65%.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes. That's what the answer is 65%. I don't know, do you have the exact number for this quarter. But I think it's in that range.\nAdena Friedman: I think it's in that range, Alex. But probably towards the lower end, since the futures towards the high end.\nMichael Ptasznik: Right.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. And just to make up the difference is the data. So we should say, the index data, index AUM, and the futures volumes of the three components of the index systems.\nAlex Kramm: Yep. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow up from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Hi, Adena. couldn't let the call go by without asking about financial transaction tax.\nAdena Friedman: Yes.\nRich Repetto: So, I guess the question is, what are you doing to prepare? Are you having discussions with legislators? I know, certainly, there's been a lot in the press about potentially moving. Is that really possible? So what are your thoughts on all this debate on the financial transaction -- or a financial transaction tax?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So I think the first thing to say is, we're heavily engaged with the New Jersey Legislature and the Governor. We also have been receiving inbound calls from governors from other states to certainly would welcome us as a data center operator or a company that uses data centers in their states as well. The nice thing about the way that we manage our infrastructure is that we don't actually own any of our data centers. We work with Equinix as our partner today. And so, we do have flexibility. We've moved our data centers in the past. So we used to operate out of Trumbull, Connecticut. We moved Carteret several years ago. And then also, we used to be in Ashburn, Virginia for our backup or now in Chicago. So we do have experienced moving data centers. We've also moved our data centers in Sweden. So we are familiar with what that takes. And I think that obviously, in this particular context, it's not just us, we have to work very, very closely with our clients, because our clients are all embedded in our data centers, as well. And they've built infrastructure to support connections between Chicago and New Jersey. So there is an investment that would need to be made in order for us as an ecosystem to choose to go to a different state. But it is absolutely feasible to do it. I think that what we've made clear is that, we certainly operate well in New Jersey. And we have a well established ecosystem here. And if we don't think there's a risk of a tax, then that's something that would obviously be our first choice. But if we believe that the state could impose a tax, just because our data centers happen to be located in their state, and that tax creates friction in the market, that then lessens participation from investors, particularly retail investors, then widen spreads and lowers liquidity, we have to do the responsible thing and find an environment that doesn't introduce oppression. And in every other cases you know, Rich, that transaction taxes have been implemented in other countries, they've seen really negative effects on liquidity and spreads. And so, we have a lot of proof points to say, friction matters, taxes create a friction, and it will have a negative impact, right at a time when given the volatility we really needed to maximize liquidity in the market. So we are like serious about it. And we are heavily engaged with New Jersey and other states to understand the best long term path for it.\nRich Repetto: Thank you. And just, I think there is a coalition among the exchanges to sort of represent your position. And I think Nasdaq is part of it. But I haven't heard as much outside about it, I guess?\nAdena Friedman: I would just say that there's a wide range of participants, market resistance and exchanges involved and understanding the -- and involved in speaking with the legislature on this issue. Just quickly to get back out to Alex Kramm's question. The specific percentage of revenue coming from AUM in the quarter within our indexes was 63%.\nRich Repetto: And just to add to that Adena, it was about 24% on the index licensing side -- on the futures licensing side?\nAdena Friedman: Oh, it's 24, not 21. Okay. Thank you.\nRich Repetto: Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. So, Rich, I hope that answers your question. Thank you.\nRich Repetto: Sure does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nKen Hill: Hey, good morning. First, I just want to say congrats to Michael and Ann [ph] on the transition there. My questions on the Q's innovation suite you guys launched. I know, I was just curious from an economic perspective to Nasdaq. Are there new products being rolled out? Do this have any different pricing or any different economics for Nasdaq given maybe like a lower cost product? I know you're rolling out with the Q's, or an alternative type of product there. And then I guess, just thinking forward, are there any other additional products, you might be looking to slice and dice a little bit differently here within the index suite?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So on the first point, we don't tend to talk specifically about how we structure theses with each individual partner. But I would say that we're very comfortable with how we've built this partnership with Invesco, and to make sure that we are getting properly compensated for the value of the indexes. And so, I think we feel comfortable that if the clients choose the new products, so they choose the current products, we're very happy with the fee rate that we're getting. In terms of other new products, that's actually the most fun part of the index team. They're always considering new strategies and new ways that we can look at both our benchmark like the Nasdaq-100 and Biotech as well as more thematic indexes to bring creativity to investors. And so, we are constantly working with our index partners to find new ways to slice and dice it. So for instance, I think it was a Victory, where we also have implemented the Nasdaq-250, which is the next 50 stocks below the Nasdaq-100. So we have kind of different ways that people can choose to participate in the broader Nasdaq franchise for different partners.\nKen Hill: Okay. Thanks for the color there.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for the follow up. Just on the U.S. cash equities market in terms of pricing and revenue captures. We sort of moving into the end of the year. Two dynamics going on there. Obviously, one, we're seeing more volume getting executed off exchange. I suspect that's a part of the retail dynamic and market maker dynamic. Maybe if you could just talk about that? And whether there's any interest in pricing initiatives to capture more of that share. And then, any sort of thoughts on members exchange. And that was seems like that was delayed a little bit. But in terms of pricing, whether you would be doing any pre-emptive pricing against that exchange coming into the fourth quarter?\nAdena Friedman: Okay. So with cash equities pricing, the first thing I would say is, as you all know, it's something that we work on very dynamically, and we make small changes pricing almost monthly actually within their cash equities business. And so, I would say that we're always watching that and working with our clients to understand how we can bring attractive flow into the Nasdaq exchanges. And in terms of the retail trying to get more of the retail to come on to exchange from off exchange. You are correct, that the retail trend has driven a higher level off exchange volumes. And so those orders are not getting subject to the price discovery that we have on market. We'd love to get -- capture more of that. But we also reflect on the fact that the intermediaries have a flow scheme that's different than our exchange fee scheme. So we have to work within the exchange fee structure that we're allowed to operate in. And that will limit our ability to kind of bring in a lot of that new retail office that's going off exchange. But we are always talking to them about on the margins, how can we get more of the retail flow to come through to the exchange. I think that in terms of OMX [ph], and the way that we're managing that, we are highly engaged with our clients we have been now ever since they announced that they were forming OMX. And we take every competitor seriously. And to the extent that we see changes in behaviors among our clients, we will first on to make sure that we are maximizing and optimizing our platform. And we're having those that dialogue all the time. So I wouldn't say that you're going to see dramatic things, but more an ongoing effort from a pricing perspective to manage to that, competitor to the extent that they have early success.\nBrian Bedell: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman for any closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you very much. Well, I just want to thank you all. And I do want to again, thank Michael, for just an amazing time together. I mean we've had, we've really are great partners. And he's also done a spectacular job of preparing Ann for the role. He's sponsored her and mentored her. I've had a chance to work very closely with Ann over the years. And so I just can't be more excited to say that, despite the fact that we're very sad to see Michael leave, we're excited for him in his next step. And we are just thrilled that we have such a strong internal candidate to come in and take the role of CFO. And of course, you get to see Michael a lot over the next few months, including at our investor day, which is on November 10. And we hope that you all join us either virtually or in person and we look forward to that. So thank you all very much and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, you may now disconnect everyone. Have a great day.",

            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to report NASDAQ's financial results for the third quarter of 2020. With our strategic ambitions as our guide, we have been consistently focused on delivering results for our clients while creating sustainable value for our stakeholders. Our global workforce has demonstrated their nimbleness and ability to remain highly productive and available to our clients throughout this period. That focus is reflected in today's strong results where we are seeing significant contributions from across our franchise. My remarks today will focus on business unit highlights and strategic initiatives from the third quarter. I will then touch on today's announcement about Michael's decision to retire and then Michael will cover the financials. Nasdaq delivered another quarter of strong performance driven by great efforts by our team, coupled with stapled favorable market conditions. Here are some of the highlights. We welcome to 105 IPOs of Nasdaq during the period which represents the highest number of IPOs for quarter on a U.S. exchange in the past decade. Conviction by investors to increase exposure to Nasdaq's focus, semantic indexes, coupled with rigorous market performance continued to support our expanding index business. As a result, we saw the AUM in our index products achieve another quarter of record highs alongside high trading activity and Nasdaq license index derivatives. Our market infrastructure performed exceptionally well during the peaks of volatility we observed earlier this year, particularly in March and April. We continued to experience strong volumes across our equities and options businesses in the third quarter, and we've continued to invest to enable us to have capacity for future volatility as markets react to continually changing dynamics in the U.S. and globally. Our Data & Analytics business within information services as well as our market technology business continue to demonstrate their resilience with healthy growth in annualized recurring revenue or ARR market tech and targeted sales and new capabilities and products across our product suite. We were pleased to announce the launch of several new products during the period including the cloud-deployed Nasdaq Automated Investigator, or anti-money laundering or AML to SaaS solution for investigating financial crime for retail commercial banks and other financial institutions. And in our licensed index futures business, we announced together with CME Group two innovative index products; a new futures contracts on the Nasdaq 100 volatility index known as \u201cVOLQ\u201d and the first ever water index futures based on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index. Early in October, we also announced an expansion of our partnership with Invesco for our Nasdaq 100 products suite, including a new Nasdaq next-gen 100 index ETF. Our results for the third quarter highlights the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offerings and business model while operating in a unique capital markets environments in 2020. Our ability to execute against the significant demand and logistical challenges of COVID-19 enabled us to continue on our strategic journey and bring these new and innovative technology and index solutions to our clients. Now I will turn to our strong results for the third quarter of 2020. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $715 million, an increase of $83 million, or 13% from the prior year period, driven almost entirely by an organic growth. Net revenues and our market services business grew 15% while revenues in our non-trading segments rose 12% from the prior year period. Operating leverage was particularly strong with non-GAAP operating margin expanding nearly 200 basis points to 52% and contributing to the non-GAAP EPS growth of 20%. Turning now to specific highlights from the third quarter, starting with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our market services segments saw net revenues of $259 million, a 15% increase from the prior year period led by 35% increase in cash equity net revenues, as well as strong growth in both the equity derivatives and trade management services businesses. While of course, industry volumes were a main contributor to this performance, I do want to bring attention to the strong competitive positioning that market services has established and which continued in the third quarter. In particular, we have enjoyed relatively stable market share in U.S. equities in areas where we feature the single largest liquidity pool with the Nasdaq stock market, the largest of our three equities exchanges. Additionally, our Nordic equity franchise with a 77% share on exchange trading was up nearly 500 basis points year-over-year. And in our U.S. options trading complex, we continue to lead the industry with a 37% share of mostly listed options. The elevated volumes we've experienced are the results of both high investor engagement and a multitude of macro and geopolitical uncertainties. While the activity levels can change quickly, we believe that the U.S. Presidential election remains a big focus for investors, and we anticipate our set of marketplaces are likely to continue to contribute at a high level as we progress through the final quarter of the year. Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenues of $132 million; a 6% increase boosted by new listing activity and continued demand for our governance and investor relations intelligence solutions. In our listings, and our listing services business Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 105 IPOs for 79% win rate for operating company listings and an overall win rate of 65% when including stocks. We are proud to welcome GoodRX, Li Auto, Jamf Holding Corp and nCino as just a few of the highlight listings from the quarter. Our quarterly win rate of Saas [ph] has also been rising from 30% in the second quarter to 51% in the third quarter. In addition, we were honoured to welcome to six companies who have switched their listings from the New York Stock Exchange Nasdaq during the period with an aggregate global market capitalization of $187 billion, including AstraZeneca and Keurig Dr. Pepper. This brings our cumulative exchange swiss market cap to over $1.8 trillion since 2005, with over $1 trillion of that value switching in just the last five years. When it came to their decision to switch exchanges, these issues, issuers identified strongly with the innovative spirit of Nasdaq's listing platform with the expanding community of listed issuers recognizing the opportunity to leverage our IR and governance solutions to improve how they engage with critical stakeholders. And lastly for the larger switches to potentially increase their representation in the Nasdaq family of indexes by qualifying for the Nasdaq 100. In the third quarter, corporate services revenue grew 6% with a balanced contribution from both governance and IR solutions. We are pleased that rising secular demand for insights that help companies better understand and engage the shareholders is more than offsetting the impact of spending reductions by companies and sectors more negatively impacted by COVID-19. We believe that our successes during the quarter underscore how Nasdaq continues to be the destination exchange and partner of choice for companies worldwide with unparalleled expertise across equity markets, investor relations and governance. Now let me turn to our information services and technology businesses. In our information services segment, we delivered net revenues of $238 million up $40 million, or 20% from the prior year period. Index AUM rose to $313 billion versus $207 billion in the prior year period up 51%. While contract volumes in the Nasdaq license index futures that trade on the CME rose by more than 90%. Each of these contributed meaningfully to the index revenue rising $30 million or 54% year-over-year. While the NASDAQ 100 family of indexes has had market appreciation materially above the broader market averages 30% -- 37% of the increase in AUM year-over-year came from positive organic investor inflows and we're working with our partners to meet rising investor interest in Nasdaq thematic indexes in several ways. For example, as I stated earlier in my remarks, just last week, Invesco introduced the QQQ Innovation Suite in partnership with Nasdaq, giving a wider population of investors access to the Nasdaq 100 index for a variety of investment structures, and providing exposure to the Nasdaq next-gen 100 index through a new ETF. Additionally, we launched VOLQ, a new futures contract on the Nasdaq 100 volatility index, and announced plans to launch a futures contract based on the Nasdaq Veles California Water Index. Our investment data and analytics revenues increased 13% from the prior year period driven both by the incorporation of syllabus and the organic growth in our leading institutional asset allocation solutions. Market data rose 5% with contributions from across our North American and European proprietary products as well as the tape plan revenue. Growth during the period was driven by new sales and increased -- retail investor usage worldwide, particularly in new geographies, like Asia Pacific and Latin America. In addition, this area of the business saw new customer expansion and new product launches driven by the launch of the Nasdaq cloud data service, a service that we believe provides significant technical cost reductions, and quick [Indiscernible] time for market for clients seeking real time data solutions. Lastly, our market technology segments delivered $86 million in revenue and sized $84 million in new order intake. ARR in the quarter was $278 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. However, total revenue rose only nominally in the third quarter compared to prior year as the growth in the more stable SaaS subscription and recurrent licensing fees that comprise our ARR was offset by lower non-recurring revenues associated with new service implementations and change requests. As we stated earlier in 2020, service implementation change request projects, new order intake levels and funding for new markets and new markets initiatives have been adversely impacted by the pandemic related factors. We continue to expect to see in the short term mostly logistical growth headwinds that underpin the risk of market technology being below the bottom of our medium term growth objectives for the current year. We have taken actions that we hope will mitigate pressures on our non-recurring market technology revenues in the coming period. For example, we've developed new ways in improving execution for important project phases in a completely virtual environment. And we've increased hiring and technology staff as part of an effort to quicken the pace of our full slate of existing implementations to their production phases. To increase technology faster, manage large projects and deliver projects, it's had an impact on the short term margins and we are managing this expense increase carefully as we continue to be focused on driving margin expansion as the business continues to grow. Taking a step back and the near term impact of the pandemic, our conviction has not changed about the medium to long term opportunity for market technology. A major component of this strategy is our commitment to operating and providing best-in-class stock solutions across the transaction lifecycle. Our marketplace services platform, which launched in June gives clients the complete transaction lifecycle functionality on a single platform and we've seen positive response in growth and demand for the platform over the quarter. In 2020 year-to-date, we've increased the count of sales to entirely new clients, the vast majority of which have chosen to implement our next generation SaaS enabled services. Specifically, we signed eight new market infrastructure operator clients through our SaaS offerings and we've signed 12 new trade surveillance clients so far this year. We've also had solid success in expanding our existing client relationships in our trade surveillance business. We look forward to updating you both in addressing the near term challenges we're navigating as well as our progress and ramping adoption of our next generation products and services in the coming period. Now, let me take a moment to address today's announcements as Mike will be retiring in early 2021 after a very distinguished 30-year financial services career. Michael joined Nasdaq in 2016 as CFO to lead a dynamic team responsible for Finance, Treasury, Strategy, Investor Relations facilities and risk management. His extensive operational expertise and industry reputation for strategic thinking, creative resource management, and managing through a competitive and evolving landscape made him a perfect fit for us during what has been an especially important phase in our growth as a company. Michael has been an invaluable member of the executive leadership team during this time at Nasdaq. He played a particularly important role in our management team strategic review of our business in 2017 after which we realigned our vision, mission and corporate strategy to embrace our core strengths in data analytics and technology, our strategic pivot as we refer to it. Michael has since played an instrumental role in the execution of that strategic pivot. For example, he worked closely with me to establish a clear, consistent capital deployment and return framework, including an annual review of our business portfolio, and effectively manage the balance sheet to improve liquidity and lower borrowing costs. Michael has been a wonderful partner to our business unit leaders, bringing creative ideas as well as a structured approach across business unit initiatives. He has worked extensively with our business units to evaluate and execute on organic and inorganic opportunities, and he oversaw the launch and development of our Venture Investment Group. Michael has been an outstanding CFO bringing focus, drive, creativity and determination to his role every day. And on behalf of the entire team at Nasdaq and the board of directors, I want to thank you Michael for his leadership and dedication to our company into our values. When Michael retires at the end of February next year, I'm very pleased to announce that Ann Dennison, who currently serves as Senior Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer will become Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ann join Nasdaq in 2015 and since 2017, she's been leading an extensive multi-year modernization of the company's financial operations infrastructure. These efforts include Nasdaq's migration to a modern financial consolidation and reporting system leveraging workday financials, the introduction of a new enterprise resource planning platform and surrounding systems and the development of a corporate data strategy and intelligent automation programs that are delivering interesting insights and powerful efficiencies. Additionally, Ann added to her responsibilities in 2017, when she took on leadership with a financial planning and analysis team, which partners with the business units and expertise to develop to maintain our detailed forecasts and budgets. And as a dedicated leader with a deep understanding of our business and our long term vision, she has made significant contributions to Nasdaq's financial soundness in her five years with the company, and her diligence and expertise will be important factors in our growth strategy. With her combination of experience and leadership skills, as well as her thorough knowledge of Nasdaq's business and financial operations, and is the obvious and best choice to become assets next CFO. I'm excited for our analysts and investors to meet Ann in the coming months as Michael and Ann work together to transition the role between now and the end of February. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that we are very pleased with the strong results we delivered in the third quarter and we've remained focused on advancing our strategic mission. Our results highlight the strength of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model, capitalizing both on opportunities presented by this year's unique capital markets backdrop, including elevated trading volumes, rising index valuations and strong IPO issuance. We believe that our ability to execute against the significant demand and the logistical challenges of COVID-19 has enabled us to continue on our journey, while prudently advancing as a technology and analytics provider. And with that, I will turn it over to Michael to review the financial details. Sure. So thanks Rich. I think that the first thing I noticed. We've kind of given you a little bit of a guidance in the past to say that, that the index futures revenue kind of ranges from 10% to 20% of the overall revenues for the index business. And it's obviously ebbs and flows based on volume. So it's not we can't give you a precise percentage every quarter, but this quarter, it was 21%. So it's just at the top end of that or just above the top end of that range. And I think that that shows you the strength of the fact that we have a great relationship with CME and I think that we have a long term partnership with them and, and the indexes that we have to -- 100 for CME is particularly strong index this year, and one where we see a lot of investor appetite to invest in ETFs and the products as well as to use the futures markets to help hedge and manage their portfolios. Thank you, Rich. Sure. I think that it can kind of break down what we were trying to convey. The first is that they are ARR growth, which is really the recurring revenue streams that comes from our newer offerings that are SaaS oriented as well as trade [ph] for balanced business which is SaaS oriented. When those continue to see, you're seeing continued growth at 9% growth and we can continue to see that that will be a strong part of our franchise. And I think that we should recognize also that, that those types of implementations are more simple. They're just, they don't take as long to, to put a bring a company into the market, whether it's the marketplace services platform, or to bring them on to our trade surveillance or market surveillance platform. It's a, it's a bigger project, where we still do significant on-prem deliveries, where this year, we've definitely seen more of an impact of that. And if you think about it is there's a lot of collaboration that needs to go on between us and the client on so that particularly in the post trade deliveries, and we have several post rate deliveries that we're working on at the moment. And the pandemic made it harder to have that collaboration and it kind of created some, some challenges in terms of keeping up the pace of the original delivery schedule. And we've gotten, we've gotten better at that as we've gone through the year. And the clients also have gotten more used to it as well. But that I think definitely created some challenges. And then also just making sure that in order for us to make sure we're managing the pace of those, we have been making some increases in the tech team to make sure that we can deliver against that in this kind of constrained environment. And those are, those are short term issues. And those are the types of revenues that are non-recurring because they are delivery revenues. But they are, they continue to be an important part of the business. And then on change requests, it's really a matter of our ability. We actually have the capacity to implement change requests when the clients are looking for them. But when they're not, we obviously apply those people to the implementation projects. But we also are finding that clients are making change requests for sure, but just have a lower demand for those this year, because they're managing through other issues in their own organization. So I think you should assume those are shorter term trends that are really driven by the current environment, against the nice long term trend in terms of us increasing the percentage of sales that we're getting through SaaS, as well as continuing to move more of our products into a more flexible delivery mode with NFS. So I think I'm hoping that gives you an enough backdrop. Well, on the asset manager's side, we don't actually have a lot of asset managers and clients in the market tech business. We tend to really focus in on market infrastructure operators, as well as broker dealers. And we do have a small business that we've been growing in the surveillance business formed by clients. So I think market tech won't, asset manager consolidation will be a significant issue there. And then if you look over in the information services business, we have thousands of asset manager clients. And so you are seeing, an occasional combination and that's where we also work with them to figure out if they're, let's say, both of the clients are investment clients, then we'll work with them to figure out well, what is the overall enterprise value going forward, that they should, they should, that we should be able to charge for investment on a combined basis versus a single basis. It's really a matter of us working with the clients on that. And certainly, if the client, one client is an investment client and the other one is not, then we have a chance of actually increasing our penetration in that client as they combine. So I think that's the way to look at it for the investment business. And same with areas like [Indiscernible] and others were which are still very small and growing. There's just a huge sea, as you know, of asset managers out there, it's for us to appeal to. On the trading side of the business, I don't anticipate that that will have a real impact because they're basically just managing more AUM with their trading organization, and that shouldn't have a significant impact on how much they're trading and how they're managing their portfolio. So I don't see an impact on the trading side. Sure. Yes. We will spend a little bit more time on that in the Investor Day, Alex. So I think it is an area that will at least give you a sense of our focus areas. But I'll give you a little bit rough preview. I think what we've said all along is that we look at acquisitions as part of fitting into our strategy. So we don't just look at every acquisition out there. Optimistically, we have really developed a strategic nexus around where we want to grow and how we want to grow, and where we think that we can do everything organically and where we might benefit from acquisition sector to catalyze growth and/or expand our clientele. And I think that the areas that we have been primarily focused on, we've said this many times, is an expanding our Architect business and expanding our Information Services business in terms of growth to you're part of the sector of the industry. And then on the on the marketplace -- in the marketplaces, I think that we would make targeted acquisitions if it really makes sense in terms of both synergies on the cost side. And so therefore the ability to generate scale, but also that it furthers our strategy in the asset classes where we're really strong. But -- and all I can say is that, we looked at a lot of things. We do always put them within the strategic framework, so that we also stop looking at things on pretty quickly if it doesn't really fit in. And we will certainly not shy away from doing the right transactions that further our strategy. But that hasn't changed. We aren't not shifting our strategy from what we've been seeing over the last few years. So we'll spend a little more time on that at the Investor Day. ,: So, we do think that there's just a strong secular interest and appetite among investors to invest in the Nasdaq-100, the Biotech index, Semiconductor, other automatic indexes, in addition to our smart beta franchise. And then, we've seen that through both this kind of upward market swing, but also even in March, the largest inflow week that we had was the toughest market week, as the markets were declining the most, that's when we saw something like $4 million or $5 million of inflows into the Nasdaq-100. So, we just think that the indexes that we have are more align with long term themes. But I also would say, there is obviously some beta components there and on the trading. We are making sure that we continue to generate growth there by launching new products and making sure we gathering AUM into those products as well. And that will be a testament to our ability to do that over the next several years to continue to expand that franchise. With regard to the market data business, we are continuing -- I think the one thing that this year is shown, it's a very resilient business. And we have done a nice job of diversifying the clientele, which earlier in the year, we mentioned, could create some challenges just in terms of clients who are -- some of the newer clients in other parts of the world. But actually, we found that we continue to see really strong demand from those clients to continue to provide and expand the data that they're providing to investors around the world. So that's showing up in the numbers. And in fact, our audit revenue this quarter is significantly down from last year third quarter. And our audit revenue for the year is down from last year. So we're actually not collecting as much on the backfilling. We're really driving the growth that we're seeing this quarter is really just from pure new customers, and obviously, the expansion of our current clients. In terms of the consolidation and the impact from the online brokers, there will be some impact from that. And we've been -- we've known that for a long time. The nice thing is that it takes a long time of close these deals. So we've had a lot of time to work with this clients and continue to make sure that they're taking all the products that they can take from us as they become a combined organization. But we do also see continued strong demand coming from New FinTech clients. And so, I think that there's a nice balance there. But we've always said that that is a low to medium term -- I mean, low to mid single digit grower because it's a more mature part of our business. So hopefully that gives you more context. Sure. Sure. Well, to be honest, we're reading about that the same way you are. So, I hope that you must to understand that there's nothing that -- we're reading at the same time you're reading it. So I think that the things -- that is the one thing I would like to say. And secondly, I think that we've been able to demonstrate multiple times over a decade, that we have a highly competitive market model that our products are subject to competition in the data space. And that we provide a great value for investors and participants alike in the market data that we provide. And I think we do it in a very responsible way. And I think we've proven that both to our customers. And we do have a very good relationship with our customers on the market data front despite some of the things that you see in the paper. But I have to say, behind the scenes, we continue to have very strong relationships across our clientele. As well as the fact that and in addition to that, we've had to defend ourselves several times now, both in a court like situation. And I think we've done. We've been able to prove ourselves over and over again, that this is a competitive space that we price our products competitively, and that we create great value for those people who use those data. So I think that, we remain very confident, Mike, in the way that we manage the business, as well as how we deliver products. And we're happy to engage with whoever wants to talk to us about that. That's the first I've got that question. So first of all, Nasdaq private market continues to have solid activity this year. It has been lower this year in terms of the overall level of tenders that have been issued in the private market this year. But generally speaking, we continue to have good clientele and a strong service that we offer the private companies, and they're still taking advantage of managing their liquidity in the private space. But it's been a little bit, I would say, decelerated a little bit this year just based on, I think, really the volatility and understanding, and the way that people are entering their businesses. But if you're asking, I think, a broader question is, because of all of the different alternative ways that companies can now tap into the public market, are they going to continue to stay private longer? And I think that's a good longer term question that we're going to have to see play out. So, our company is going to tap into the public markets earlier in their lifecycle, which may make it so that they have less of a demand to tenders. I don't think we can know the answer to that right now. I think that we are obviously seeing a lot of growth companies, but still quite mature, quite full on in terms of their overall ability to tap the public markets. I mean, we're still seeing high valuations and strong performance companies coming into the public markets both respects and through a traditional IPOs, and it's been a very active year. But I also think that there are just thousands of private companies that will continue to mature in the private space before they tap the public markets. And so, I personally think that the private market will continue to have a huge opportunity. We're really frankly, barely scratching the surface of private company's liquidity right now. And so, we have a lot more we can do there. But it is a good question as to whether more companies will come out to the public market sooner, and I just don't know the answer yet. Sure. I don't know, if I'll be able to answer that in detail today something, but we'll take it back and try to figure out how we can help with that as we get into Investor Day. I think that in terms of the margin dynamics, I think what we've been saying all along continues to be very much the case, which is, the more that we can move our clients into a SaaS offering. So whether it's market -- our market surveillance offering, as we've launched SaaS offering this year and we've seen strong pick up there. And that -- and our trade surveillance offering has always been SaaS. And those offerings definitely allow us to have a higher overall margin just because the implementation time is shorter. And it's a recurring revenue stream. And so it's just a different composition of revenue that delivers a stronger margin for us. Whereas with the on-prem implementations, we obviously manage to the margin that we think is the right way to go. But we do often do fixed price contracts there. So sometimes if implementation ends up being longer and more complex, it can make it like -- it can make it so that we end up having to put more resources to it, and that can have some margin impact in the short term on the implementation. And that's what's happening this year. But over time, I think the more we can show that we're -- the new sales for generating our NFS, which is a much more flexible platform, and SaaS driven and/or because some of the NFS deliveries are still on-prem, some are in are SaaS, as well as our surveillance business is all SaaS. So the more we can drive to that higher margin. And so it's up to us to show you that shift in the order intake and the type of order in take that we're taking in. And that's something that we want to make sure that we provide more context around at Investor Day in a few weeks. I think that they're two key factors that in our opinion are taking volumes to different levels this year. One is just overall volatility and uncertainty. And that always makes it so that you've got investors that have more different opinions, right? So when there are investors that have different views on what could happen next and how the economy is going to progress, you have more volatility, because those opinions all get expressed in the market and that drives our volumes. But at the same time, we also have a lot more younger retail investors coming into the markets as well. And so, I think that has to do with the fact that we do have more engagement around from retail investors. And those retail investors coming into the market, also drive volume stock. Now, the question is, are those retail investors as stainable trends? And I think that as we've been listening to the online brokers speak about it. And we've been talking to our own clients about it. I think that there's a view that there is a new wave of investors that have come in on the backs of zero commissions, which takes down the friction in the market, and therefore increases overall access, as well as the fact that the macro environment has created some really strong investment opportunities for retail investors. And I think that that is a longer term trend and a healthy one and an exciting one. But I don't think every one of those retail investors will be here over the long term. But I think we are seeing a secular shift in getting more younger investors engaged in the market. And I think that could create a more sustainably higher trading environment than what we saw in 2017, 2018, 2019 timeframe. But I think that time will tell. But that's our -- I think that's our overall view, just speaking with industry professionals who really understand the nature of the investors coming in. Sure. Well, one thing just to note is that the amortization of the initial listing fees is really the fees that get amortized. That amortization schedule did change a bit a few years, a couple years ago. So it's a little shorter than it used to be. But you're right, that the initial listing fees do get amortized. And I think, Michael, its for IPOs, its still over two years or two to three. Yes. And so I would just say that, first of all, there are no kind of one time fees that are creating that increase in the quarter. It is really -- it just the nature of the strength of new issuance market coupled with the strength in our corporate solutions business. And those are recurring revenue streams. So I do -- I think that's important thing to say. But I think that because of the fact that new issuances have been high throughout the year, you're starting to see that compounding effect of that as we get more and more issuance -- issuers in the market. And then they then start to generate annual listing fees, which will then create a list going into 2021. So that's the good news is it is kind of really just coming from the strength of new issuances. I just wanted to make sure you know that the amortization schedule is a little different than it was a few years ago. Alright. Yes. So we are very prudent in the way that we manage our fees. We're very proud of the fact that we deliver a really strong value to our clients. And we never want to give our top clients any reason to even consider an alternative. And fees do play a role in that. I wouldn't say that it's -- you're right, it's not the reason they switched to Nasdaq. But it can be a door opener for them to consider. They're paying $500,000 to list on your and they're paying $160,000 to list here. And they're getting frankly, in our opinion a far superior service here. Then it allows us to open the door to a conversation and then work with them on all the other aspects of our value proposition to have them move over. So I would have to say, the key differential is a catalyst to conversations on switches. And for IPOs, we think that we offer fee structure that is a strong reflection of the value that we give to our clients. And I think its -- so, we feel good about how we tear our fees in the max that we charge. And we'll continue to make pricing changes periodically to reflect the increased investments we're making in the business. But we don't see a reason frankly, to make a big change in our fees at the top end. Sure. I know it's -- Michael, you might have it more readily available. But I know within any given quarters, like 60% to 65%. I think it's in that range, Alex. But probably towards the lower end, since the futures towards the high end. Sure. And just to make up the difference is the data. So we should say, the index data, index AUM, and the futures volumes of the three components of the index systems. Yes. Sure. So I think the first thing to say is, we're heavily engaged with the New Jersey Legislature and the Governor. We also have been receiving inbound calls from governors from other states to certainly would welcome us as a data center operator or a company that uses data centers in their states as well. The nice thing about the way that we manage our infrastructure is that we don't actually own any of our data centers. We work with Equinix as our partner today. And so, we do have flexibility. We've moved our data centers in the past. So we used to operate out of Trumbull, Connecticut. We moved Carteret several years ago. And then also, we used to be in Ashburn, Virginia for our backup or now in Chicago. So we do have experienced moving data centers. We've also moved our data centers in Sweden. So we are familiar with what that takes. And I think that obviously, in this particular context, it's not just us, we have to work very, very closely with our clients, because our clients are all embedded in our data centers, as well. And they've built infrastructure to support connections between Chicago and New Jersey. So there is an investment that would need to be made in order for us as an ecosystem to choose to go to a different state. But it is absolutely feasible to do it. I think that what we've made clear is that, we certainly operate well in New Jersey. And we have a well established ecosystem here. And if we don't think there's a risk of a tax, then that's something that would obviously be our first choice. But if we believe that the state could impose a tax, just because our data centers happen to be located in their state, and that tax creates friction in the market, that then lessens participation from investors, particularly retail investors, then widen spreads and lowers liquidity, we have to do the responsible thing and find an environment that doesn't introduce oppression. And in every other cases you know, Rich, that transaction taxes have been implemented in other countries, they've seen really negative effects on liquidity and spreads. And so, we have a lot of proof points to say, friction matters, taxes create a friction, and it will have a negative impact, right at a time when given the volatility we really needed to maximize liquidity in the market. So we are like serious about it. And we are heavily engaged with New Jersey and other states to understand the best long term path for it. I would just say that there's a wide range of participants, market resistance and exchanges involved and understanding the -- and involved in speaking with the legislature on this issue. Just quickly to get back out to Alex Kramm's question. The specific percentage of revenue coming from AUM in the quarter within our indexes was 63%. Oh, it's 24, not 21. Okay. Thank you. Okay. So, Rich, I hope that answers your question. Thank you. Sure. So on the first point, we don't tend to talk specifically about how we structure theses with each individual partner. But I would say that we're very comfortable with how we've built this partnership with Invesco, and to make sure that we are getting properly compensated for the value of the indexes. And so, I think we feel comfortable that if the clients choose the new products, so they choose the current products, we're very happy with the fee rate that we're getting. In terms of other new products, that's actually the most fun part of the index team. They're always considering new strategies and new ways that we can look at both our benchmark like the Nasdaq-100 and Biotech as well as more thematic indexes to bring creativity to investors. And so, we are constantly working with our index partners to find new ways to slice and dice it. So for instance, I think it was a Victory, where we also have implemented the Nasdaq-250, which is the next 50 stocks below the Nasdaq-100. So we have kind of different ways that people can choose to participate in the broader Nasdaq franchise for different partners. Okay. So with cash equities pricing, the first thing I would say is, as you all know, it's something that we work on very dynamically, and we make small changes pricing almost monthly actually within their cash equities business. And so, I would say that we're always watching that and working with our clients to understand how we can bring attractive flow into the Nasdaq exchanges. And in terms of the retail trying to get more of the retail to come on to exchange from off exchange. You are correct, that the retail trend has driven a higher level off exchange volumes. And so those orders are not getting subject to the price discovery that we have on market. We'd love to get -- capture more of that. But we also reflect on the fact that the intermediaries have a flow scheme that's different than our exchange fee scheme. So we have to work within the exchange fee structure that we're allowed to operate in. And that will limit our ability to kind of bring in a lot of that new retail office that's going off exchange. But we are always talking to them about on the margins, how can we get more of the retail flow to come through to the exchange. I think that in terms of OMX [ph], and the way that we're managing that, we are highly engaged with our clients we have been now ever since they announced that they were forming OMX. And we take every competitor seriously. And to the extent that we see changes in behaviors among our clients, we will first on to make sure that we are maximizing and optimizing our platform. And we're having those that dialogue all the time. So I wouldn't say that you're going to see dramatic things, but more an ongoing effort from a pricing perspective to manage to that, competitor to the extent that they have early success. Great. Thank you very much. Well, I just want to thank you all. And I do want to again, thank Michael, for just an amazing time together. I mean we've had, we've really are great partners. And he's also done a spectacular job of preparing Ann for the role. He's sponsored her and mentored her. I've had a chance to work very closely with Ann over the years. And so I just can't be more excited to say that, despite the fact that we're very sad to see Michael leave, we're excited for him in his next step. And we are just thrilled that we have such a strong internal candidate to come in and take the role of CFO. And of course, you get to see Michael a lot over the next few months, including at our investor day, which is on November 10. And we hope that you all join us either virtually or in person and we look forward to that. So thank you all very much and have a great day."

            "name": "Michael Ptasznik",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena for those kinds of remarks, and good morning everyone. I will first provide comments on the quarter and then a few remarks about my decision to retire. My commentary on the quarter will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in our file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter revenue performance as shown on page three of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages four and 14. The $83 million increase in reported net revenue of $715 million is a net result of organic growth of $70 million, including 13% organic increase in market services, and 10% organic growth in the non-trading segments, a $4 million positive impact from acquisitions and a $9 million favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I will start with information services, which as reflected on pages five and 14 saw a $40 million or 20% increase in revenue, excluding a positive $3 million impact from the acquisition of Solovis and a $1 million positive impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic revenue growth during this period was 18%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and positive contributions from each of the investment data and analytics and market data businesses. Operating margin of 65% increased 100 basis points compared to the prior year period. Market technology revenue as shown on pages six and 14 increased $2 million, or 2%, primarily reflecting a positive $3 million impact from favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. On our organic basis, revenue decreased by $1 million, or 1% as the increase in software as a surveillance service -- surveillance revenues were more than offset by lower software delivery and support revenues and lower change requests and advisory revenues. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. Operating margin of 10% in the period was down eight percentage points from 18% in the prior year, putting margin into a 12-month context, which eliminates quarter-to-quarter volatility from seasonality and other factors the trailing 12-month margin is 16% in line with full year 2019 level. As Adena noted, progress has been impacted by the pandemic induced near term growth headwinds. However, we continue to expect margin improvement as the business expands over time. Turning to Corporate Services on pages seven and 14, revenues increased $8 million, or 6%. Organic revenue growth was $6 million or 5%, reflecting an increase in U.S. listings revenues and increases in both governance solutions and IR intelligence revenues. The operating margin of 39% for the segment was up 300 basis points from the prior year period. Market services net revenues on pages eight and 14 saw $33 million or 15% increase. Excluding the positive $4 million impact for favorable changes in foreign exchange rates, the organic revenue increase was $29 million or 13%. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash, equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. The operating margin of 59% for the segment increased two percentage points year-over-year. Turning to pages nine and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $29 million to $346 million. The increase reflects a $17 million or 5% organic increase, a $7 million increase from the impact of acquisitions and a $5 million increase from an unfavorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. The organic growth and expenses primarily reflects higher compensation expense, professional fees and infrastructure costs partially offset by lower travel and event spending. Turning to slide 10, we are adjusting our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.36 billion to $1.37 billion, up from $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion previously. The revised range is driven by two factors; first, changes in foreign exchange rates, and particularly the weakening of the U.S. dollar as manifested in a $10 million increase in the top end of our guidance range. Second, as we've continued to deliver especially strong organic growth in both of our trading and non-trading segments, higher expenses, including accruals of performance based compensation, make us increasingly likely to end up at the high end of our expense guidance range. That's a full year context. The $1.37 billion high end of our revised expense guidance range implies a 4% organic increase in expenses. While in the first nine months of 2020, the company delivered organic revenue growth of 12%. And moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $54 million in the third quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 52% compared to 50% in the prior year period. Net interest expense was $24 million in the third quarter of 2020, a decrease of $2 million versus the prior year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26% for the third quarter of 2020. For the full year 2020, we continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rate to be between 26% and 27%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2020 was $256 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, compared to $212 million or $1.27 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to slide 11, debt increased by $89 million versus June 30, primarily due to an increase in the Euro bonds book value caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period of 2.4 times and changed from 2.4 times at the end of Q2. During the third quarter of 2020, the company paid a dividend in the aggregate of $81 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $34 million. The company has repurchased $186 million year-to-date through September 30, largely completing our objective to use share repurchases to offset deletion of equity compensation, and other sources of gross issuances. And before I turn it back for the Q&A session, a few comments about my decision to retire. Why was the decision I've contemplated for a while now, it certainly comes with mixed emotions. It has been such an honor and a privilege to work for Adena, the board and this incredible company. And I am extremely excited about the vision and strategy and the great opportunities that we have ahead of us to continue to grow and expand as a technology company, serving the capital markets and beyond. Most importantly, I'm fortunate to work with colleagues who are enormously intelligent, innovative driven, and are just good people that consistently exemplify Nasdaq's values of integrity and teamwork. However, I've been in an exchange industry now for a long time going back to the 90s when exchanges were mutual broker owned not for profits. And while I can't say for certain, I do believe, I hold the record for the most consecutive quarterly conference calls as CFO of an exchange group, with this call being my 72nd in a row. And that's why the decision was so difficult. For those of you who like me are Canadian, I'm sure you'll recall the ubiquitous early retirement inducing freedom 55 commercials; I will undoubtedly understand the indelible target that left on my psyche. In finance, we forecast macroeconomics, revenues and earnings. But the one thing that no one can forecast and COVID has certainly been a great reminder of this is the time and capability will be given to enjoy the fruits of our labors. Thankfully, I have no current health concerns, but the point is, you just never know. So despite the temptation to stay and partake in the exciting initiatives and growth we have in front of us here at Nasdaq, I've decided to stick with the five year timeframe that I shared with Adena and importantly my family, when I first accepted this position. What does make my decision easier is that my knowledge of the strength of the team I am leaving behind, and I could not be more pleased that Ann Dennison will be taking on the CFO role. Ann has been a key member of my management team per technical expertise, proven ability to drive change through innovation and her collaborative approach to problem solving make her the ideal candidate for this position. She's also an absolute pleasure to work with and is always focused on doing what's best for the organization. I am confident that she's the right person to help drive Nasdaq. So there will be plenty of time next quarter to say proper thank yours, to the board and to Adena, to all my colleagues past and present and to you, the investors and analysts. At this point, I will just say it has been an honor and privilege to work for and with all of you. So now I like to just drop the mic and walk away. But I think we have to turn to Q&A session now. So I'll turn it back to the operator. And Brian, the audit number was $2 million in the quarter compared to as an unusually high quarter of nine in Q3 of 2019. Thank you very much. Yes, it depends. It's two to four years is the timeframe. Yes. But we also did -- we also did have a -- there was some pricing that was taken at the beginning of the year on the sustaining fees as well. And that's flowing through. It's been flowing through all the quarters so far this year. Yes. That's what the answer is 65%. I don't know, do you have the exact number for this quarter. But I think it's in that range. Right."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2020 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn over the call to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I would like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I am of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients and the communities in which we live during these last few months. With the second quarter being our first full period with a vast majority of our global workforce working remotely, I could not be more proud with the results that we have delivered for our stakeholders amid what is still a very unprecedented time. The executive leadership team and I are acutely aware that our colleagues, clients and so many of our stakeholders are tackling work, family and health responsibilities simultaneously. We are in the fortunate position that our business can operate in a remote working environment globally. And we've remained highly productive and available to our clients throughout this period. That said, we also recognize that some of our team members prefer the opportunity to work in an office environment. And over the long-term, we believe that there are social and creativity benefits that come from working together physically. Therefore, we are working to reopen our offices in a deliberate way as the virus subsides to specific cities and countries where we operate. And we are taking a very measured approach to the reopening of our offices that prioritizes our employees\u2019 health and safety. In that regard, we will continue to make it completely voluntary until at least year-end 2020 for our employees to choose to return to our offices. The second quarter was marked not only by the deepening impact of the global health crisis, but by the escalation and recognition of the social injustices across many communities around us. We are committed to creating lasting, positive change and I'll highlight two examples. Last month, we announced immediate actions to strengthen our continued commitment to diversity and inclusion. In addition to our $5 million first quarter pledge to COVID-19 relief, in the second quarter we pledged an additional $3 million in cash donations to organizations serving underserved minority communities and fighting the impacts of the health crisis. In addition, as we look at Nasdaq\u2019s broader purpose in the communities where we operate, particularly as a proponent of inclusive growth and prosperity, we see the Nasdaq Foundation as a core component of our societal mission. As a result, in addition to committing to an annual contribution to the Foundation of approximately one quarter of a percent of operating profit starting in 2021, we also made a one-time capital injection in Q2 of this year of $10 million to improve the funded position of the Foundation and to support its refined mission. We will update the market as we announce specific campaigns designed to support our Foundation's objectives. There's also a lot of momentum inside of Nasdaq to improve and accelerate our efforts to advance our culture. Therefore, we're increasing our internal resources devoted to programs focused on diversity-oriented professional development, employee experience and talent acquisition. Our ultimate ambition is for the Nasdaq team to reflect the diversity of the populations of each of the countries where we operate, and to provide a performance-driven culture that demonstrates respect and belonging for all of our employees. We are fully committed to taking the necessary steps in the months and years ahead to achieve this ambition.  This starts with publishing our diversity statistics from countries where we are permitted to collect that data, which we will start to do by the end of the third quarter. These will serve as an honest assessment of where we are and how far we need to progress. Nasdaq has always had a strong commitment to all three elements of ESG, environmental, social and governance practices. We believe our societal efforts will further enhance our position as a leader that is continuously striving to improve.  Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $699 million, an increase of $76 million, or 12% from the prior year period, driven almost entirely by organic growth. I'm incredibly proud to report that once again each of our four business segments delivered positive organic growth during the quarter, a testament to the resiliency of our business and the dedication of the Nasdaq team under the new remote working environment.  Net revenues in our Market Services business grew 22% while revenues in our non-trading segments grew 7% from the prior period. On an organic basis, revenues across the non-trading segments increased 6% year-over-year, with growth from acquisitions contributing 1% to total growth. Operating leverage was particularly strong as expenses were up slightly during the period resulting in the non-GAAP operating margin expanding nearly 500 basis points to 53% and contributing to non-GAAP EPS growth of 26%.  Turning now to the specific highlights from the second quarter, I will also briefly address the evolving industry and client dynamics we're observing and how we see these influencing our performance for the remainder of 2020. I will begin with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $276 million, a 22% increase from the prior year period. This was led by higher cash equity trading and equity derivatives revenue amidst the continued surge in volumes for cash equities and equity linked derivatives. These elevated volumes were driven not only by evolving expectations around the pandemic\u2019s implications, but by the way the pandemic seems to be accelerating certain long-term dynamics that have spurred significant sector rotations in the market. We said last quarter that the volume outlooks set up constructively due to both this pandemic's uncertainties and the fact that 2020 finishes with the U.S. presidential elections. A quarter later, we increasingly expect that the current economic and political backdrop will continue to support elevated volumes during the latter half of the year.  Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenues of $126 million, a 2% increase, boosted by a return in newly -- new listing activity and continued demand for our Investor Relations intelligence solutions, as well as higher revenues from corporate governance solutions. After returning to organic growth in 2019, our IR and governance businesses saw an acceleration in the first half of this year driving 8% organic growth in Corporate Solutions in the second quarter, excluding a 2% impact due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Our IR advisory services including our relatively new ESG advisory solution were top contributors in the period. We believe the restructured and repositioned Corporate Solutions product suite has a much stronger alignment with the secular trends that are driving our corporate clients\u2019 interactions with their investing community, and other stakeholders.  That said, we did experience reduced demand from corporate clients in sectors that are highly impacted by the effects of the pandemic, such as travel, retail, energy and financials where focus on expense control has become a priority. Additionally, prospect engagement in a vortical environment has created longer sales cycles for some of our corporate services. Recognizing that these impacts could change quarter-to-quarter, we have endeavoured to provide our clients with near term savings opportunities within the context of what are meant to be continued and eventually rebounding long-term relationships. In our Listing segment Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 42 IPOs for a 67% win rate. For the first six months of 2020, we welcomed 69 IPOs, representing 69% of all US-IPOs. Our IPOs have raised $17.4 billion, which represents 66% of total IPO capital raised in the United States. Excluding SPAC, we have welcomed 55 operating company IPOs for an 85% win rate in the first half of the year. Listing highlights from the second quarter include three of the top four largest IPOs by capital raise, including Royalty Pharma, the largest U.S. IPO of 2020 to-date; Warner Music Group; and ZoomInfo, the largest technology IPO of the year. Notable SPAC listings during the period included DraftKings and Nikola Motor Company. The reopening of the IPO window is very encouraging. We have seen a steady inflow of listings from technology and healthcare, industries illustrative of the kinds of companies innovating to solve some of society's most pressing challenges, which are finding a very receptive audience with investors. Companies are also responding positively to Nasdaq\u2019s virtual experience during IPOs reflecting -- reflected in our market leading win rate. Feedback from newly listed companies and also importantly from the investment banking and underwriting communities have been tremendous.  Our partners appreciate the seamless manner in which we transitioned our IPO first trade process once we changed our operation to remote environment in March. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we see a very healthy pipeline of companies looking to tap public markets with many intending to execute again ahead of the November U.S. presidential election.  Now let me turn to our technology and analytics businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $84 million in revenue and signed $38 million in new order intake. Our annualized recurring revenue in the quarter was $268 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. New order intake overall was moderate during the period as client decision making around large scaled technology projects has slowed during the pandemic. Looking within the product offerings, we note that we had strong new order intake in Nasdaq trade surveillance, a SaaS offering focused on our broker dealer clients. And we signed 5 new marketplace technology customers, all of which were signed after virtual sales process and all of whom selected our SaaS delivered market technology solutions. We were also excited to announce during the second quarter the launch of Nasdaq\u2019s Marketplace Services platform to provide our market technology clients with seamless access to standard cloud-based infrastructure component and full trade lifecycle capabilities as they move to the next phase of their digitalization. This service was announced alongside signing of our first client LEX Markets, which will leverage our cloud masking services to power their trading platform for commercial real estate securities. There is heightened interest in the ways that our next generation technology, particularly the SaaS capabilities that we have built into both market infrastructure and surveillance products can help our clients deal with heightened scalability and flexibility challenges that the pandemic brings. These examples also highlight how we've made significant strides in adapting the ways that our technologists are performing in a more remote work environment. Still implementation projects, new order intake levels and funding for new markets initiatives have been modestly impacted by pandemic-related factors. We continue to expect to see the short-term mostly logistical growth headwinds that increase the risk of the market technology being below the bottom of our medium term growth objectives for the current year. Turning to our Information Services segment, we delivered net revenues of $213 million, up $19 million or 10% from the prior year period. Index AUM rose to $272 billion at the end of the period, up 34% versus the prior year, and eclipsing a previous quarter end high of $233 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Index revenue was $68 million, up 24% year-over-year, with contributions driven primarily by the increase in ETP licensed product AUM and secondarily from fees generated from trading of licensed futures. We're incredibly pleased with the strength and resilience of our flagship index products during the quarter. We believe that the Nasdaq Composite and the NASDAQ-100 performance reflects investor interest in the companies that are supporting the modern infrastructure for tomorrow's economy, workforce and workplace. Year-to-date, AUM in all ETPs licensed to Nasdaq\u2019s indices are up over $40 billion and almost 26% of that increase or $64 -- $26 billion, sorry, of that increase or 64% came from net investor inflows to the products, with the remainder from market performance during the year.  While this segment is sensitive to what can be reversals in exogenous market beta and futures volume trends, there's no ignoring that the second quarter\u2019s positive results put us in a better position for a full year performance. Our Investment Data & Analytics revenues increased 13% from the prior year period, including the contribution of Solovis which we acquired in March. While 2020 organic growth of eVestment is seeing some impact from budget tightening on the part of the buy side, the addition of Solovis\u2019 real time performance and risk modelling gives us more opportunities to catalyze allocation decisions on the part of asset owners, decisions that in turn are higher usage of eVestments -- of leading asset manager research and selection tools.  Revenue in Market Data saw modest organic growth during the period and continues to deliver consistent results. We've seen relatively stable performance and expectations in our Market Data products.  And finally for the third quarter -- for the third consecutive quarter, the majority of our revenues in the Information Services business came from the index licensing and investment in analytics products are a direct result of focusing our investments into expanding our capabilities in higher growth areas within Information Services.  So, after reviewing each business, collectively, what does this mean from our investors\u2019 perspective? Well, overall, we continue to benefit from a business model that delivers well during challenging times, due to the resilient and diversified nature of our business. With our diversity of offerings and customers, we benefit from certain segments, bolstering our results when others face some short-term pressures. That has been the story of Nasdaq for many years now, and overall it provides for more stability and predictability than many of our direct peers. We continue to see 2020 as an elevated risk environment related to the pandemic\u2019s implications, and related changes to client purchasing behaviors could continue building in some portions of the business as the year progresses. But we also recognize that the strong performance for our index business and the rebound in demand for IPOs has us feeling directionally more optimistic than we were three months ago.  On the last quarter call we referenced our long-term outlook of 5% to 7% annualized growth in our non-trading businesses. As we experienced the early days of the pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy, we communicated that we saw risks in our ability to achieve the lower end of that growth range in 2020. Given the strength of our second quarter performance, we believe that the risks have moderated somewhat. Therefore, there's -- unless there's a sharp reversal in the current environment, our confidence has increased in our ability to achieve the lower end of our 5% to 7% organic revenue growth range collectively across our non-trading businesses for the full year of 2020. We will continue to provide updates on our growth progress as we address our third quarter results in October.  In addition to the strong results from our businesses this quarter, we also saw positive developments on the regulatory front in the period. In June, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled decisively against the SEC on two issues that were very important to us. First, the court\u2019s rule that the SEC exceeded its legal authority by creating a process to review fees long after they\u2019ve taken effect. The rule vacated or invalidated the SEC\u2019s actions in October 2018, when it overturned the ruling of its own administrative law judge that proprietary data prices were properly regulated and constrained by competition and mandated the review of hundreds of other fees. Second, the court\u2019s rule that the SEC\u2019s excess fee pilot was on unauthorized because the SEC lacks the authority to adopt rules and impose obligations if their sole purpose is to gather data. For the commission to regulate, it must identify a problem and justify its proposed solutions with sufficient economic analysis of the cost, benefits and possible alternatives. The pilot would have subjected thousands of U.S. issuers to a multi-year experiment to determine what might happen if liquidity incenting rebates and exchanges were restricted or eliminated.  We continue to believe that the U.S. stock markets are the envy of the world delivering unmatched liquidity and resiliency at extremely low cost in a highly competitive environment. We hope that as the SEC moves forward in its efforts to find ways to improve the markets, they do so with the utmost thoughtfulness to ensure that reforms fully deliver benefits across a wide range of issuers, intermediaries and investors that depend on them. Going forward, we urge the SEC to adopt a more inclusive approach to developing consensus around rule proposals and significant rule changes, particularly when those changes are wide ranging and carry a significant risk of unintended consequences.  As we look to the second half of 2020 and beyond, we now know that we will be navigating a world and economy characterized by the pandemic\u2019s effects for longer than we were expecting. We've also learned important lessons during this period that bolsters our confidence in our longer term strategy to maximize opportunities as a leading technology and analytics provider while maintaining our foundational marketplace focused businesses.  Importantly, we observed several key trends that underscore the flexibility of our strategic ambitions to serve markets everywhere. For example, we're now able to reach a new set of clients and finalize deals in our Market Technology business using our SaaS-based solutions, which provide more turnkey and scalable market capabilities for our clients in a fast changing economic environment.  While our index business will always be subject to cyclical beta related impacts due to the nature of its revenue model, we have seen a new appreciation for the thematic approaches that characterize majority of Nasdaq's index franchise. And of course, the good fortune to be in the right thematic for a world that is changing in ways that make technology and healthcare more important to everyone's lives than ever.  Additionally, our institutional investor clients are increasingly turning to a data-driven decision making in a volatile and unpredictable environment, which underscores the value of our data analytics offering. And lastly, over recent years, there's been a growing urgency among companies globally to make a positive contribution to the environment and to focus on governance practices. This year, the focus on the pandemic and its impact on our society and in particular on our underserved communities, has elevated a commitment from the private sector to key areas of social responsibility as well. As a result, we're starting to be rewarded for our efforts to expand our offerings, addressing corporate issuers and other clients\u2019 rising ESG needs.  As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that Nasdaq remains sharply focused on advancing our strategic mission. Our global team has demonstrated their seamless adjustment to the remote nature of our current operating environment. And our team's ability to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients has demonstrated in our strong results this past quarter.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. My commentary will be primarily focused on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as any file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages 4 and 14. The $76 million increase in reported net revenue of $699 million is a net result of organic growth of $75 million including 22% organic increase in Market Services and 6% organic growth in the non-trading segments, a $3 million positive impact from acquisitions, and a $2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which as reflected on pages 5 and 14 saw a $19 million or 10% increase in revenue. Organic revenue growth during the period was 9%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and then smaller but positive contributions from each of the Investment Data & Analytics and Market Data businesses. Operating margin of 62% declined about 1 point compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of Solovis. Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 14, increased $5 million, or 6%, with organic growth of $4 million, or 5%. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in Software-as-a-Service surveillance revenues. As Adena noted, annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. Operating margin of 18% was up 8 points from 10% in the prior year period, and year-to-date margin of 14% for the segment is up 4 points.  Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $3 million or 2%. Organic revenue growth was 3% or $4 million, reflecting an increase in U.S. Listings revenues and increases in both IR intelligence revenues and governance solutions revenues. This was partially offset by lower event related revenues at the Nasdaq MarketSite and lower Nasdaq Private Market program activity, both mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19. The operating margin of 39% for the segment was up 3 points from the prior period. Market Services net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $49 million or 22% increase. Excluding the negative $1 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange, the organic revenue increase of $50 million, also 22%. The organic increase driven in the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. The operating margin of 64% for the segment remains elevated due to the high volume environment.  Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses were $327 million in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $5 million or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019. This reflects a $7 million increase from the impact of acquisitions, as well as higher compensation expense, infrastructure costs and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower corporate travel expenses, event spending and changes in foreign exchange rates.  Turning to Slide 10, we are taking our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range to $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion. While we've experienced reduced levels of travel and event spending, it is important to note that we plan to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to support the current and potential for even greater activity on our platforms. In addition, we're also continuing to allocate the capital and resources to deliver on our longer term growth initiatives and our full year expense guidance range reflects these investments in the second half of the year.  Based on our latest internal expense forecast, which takes into account the impact of the relatively strong organic growth has on variable compensation, as well as the latest foreign exchange rates, as we stand here today, we see ourselves as most likely to be in the top half of our updated expense guidance range. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the second quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 53% compared to 48% in the prior year period. The nearly 500 basis point increase in the margin year-over-year reflects strong operating leverage, particularly in Market Services business as well as multi-year efforts to enhance the company\u2019s scalability. So, we would expect some near term reversion should market volumes moderate.  Net interest expense was $25 million in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $3 million versus the prior year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.4% for the second quarter of 2020. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rates to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2020 was $256 million, or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $203 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Let me now turn to the balance sheet. As we\u2019re taking steps from the first quarter of 2020 to increase cash reserves and eliminate near term maturities, in the second quarter, Nasdaq took advantage of a receptive credit environment and issued a $500 million 30 year bond. Then, as the short-term credit environment continued to improve, we became more comfortable with reducing our cash position to more normal levels and used the proceeds from our debt offering and the excess cash on hand to redeem outstanding commercial paper and to repay all the borrowers on our revolver. As a result, the company returned to lower leverage while enhancing available liquidity.  Turning to slide 11, the net of these actions is that debt decreased by $626 million versus March 31st, primarily due to $1.1 billion of aggregate net payments on revolver borrowings and commercial paper that I mentioned a moment ago. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4 times, down from 3 times in the first quarter of 2020. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9 times, down from 2.3 times in the first quarter of 2020. Also, during the second quarter of 2020, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $80 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $30 million. Year-to-date, through June 30th, the company has repurchased common stock in the amount of $152 million, largely completing our objective to use share repurchases to offset dilution of equity compensation and other sources of gross issuances to ensure investors benefit from a stable share count. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto : You seem like you're in the sweet spot right now, given your exposure to equity trading and equity options as well as having the high percentage of recurring revenue. So, I guess this -- my question is, with so much volume now going into, from retail, the TRF percentage up in the low 40 percentage. Are we missing anything? I'm trying to look at the unintended consequences of having so much off-exchange volume. Your revenue capture actually went up in equity, which I didn't understand. But just trying to see how -- given that you're in the sweet spot, make sure we're catching all the reflections here or are all the possibilities?\nAdena Friedman : Sure. Well, I would agree that retail participation in the markets, but the equities markets and the equity options markets has been -- certainly has been elevated this year. And you are right, that it is resulting in more off-exchange volume occurring. I think that what we've been really focused on is, for the volume that does, that come to the exchanges, what can we do to maximize our position? And so we've been working really hard right on a few fronts. One is, certainly just overall customer service and availability. Second is, just the scalability of our business and ability to handle these really large volume days, particularly like the Russell and the S&P 500 rebalance days. Third is that we continue to improve the performance of our systems with tech improvements and things that we're doing to make sure that we optimize the performance of our markets. And then the last thing is making sure that we really educate our customers on how to use all the elements of our markets, like our M-ELO orders and other things like that to capture as much volume as we can, but the retail volume generally gets internalized. And then of course turns into secondary volume that comes to the exchanges. So we do benefit from the overall elevated environment, but we do find that the level of internalization is something that we watch pretty carefully. Because you don't want there to be a diminishment of the price discovery that's occurring in the market by having too much of the volume go [off-exchange]. So it's something that we certainly are focused on. I think the one thing that we are focused on, Rich, is just making sure retail investors are educated as they're coming into the markets. The online retail brokers do a really good job of that. FINRA does a really good job of that. So we're just partnering with them to make sure that we're helping them with their educational efforts with the retail investors. \nRich Repetto: Anything on the revenue capture, that was part of the question -- the one question.\nAdena Friedman: So the revenue capture, it's really a function of a lot of things. So one is just which markets are they leveraging to come into the market and therefore what's our capture rate. I think we also are -- we're very careful in looking at how much volume is coming into the auctions. We did have two very large auctions in the quarter -- at the end of the quarter with the S&P500. I think that was 1.2 billion shares. And the Russell rebalance was 1.5 billion shares. And there's obviously Craigslist as well in terms of the options versus the intraday trading.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. Quick one on COVID and the current pandemic. You talked about how -- obviously there's some negative impacts on the revenues, but also positive on expenses. Anything to note positive on the revenues? I mean, are there new business wins or anything that have come out, new use case that your clients have seen where you may be benefiting coming out of this? Or is it too early to tell?\nAdena Friedman: No, actually, I think a couple of areas, Alex, I think it is actually relevant. So the first is how the demand for more of our SaaS-based technology is actually elevated during this period, because I think more and more the clients are realizing that to have the scalability and the flexibility they want to be able to have what I would take has to be on demand, to be able to manage their infrastructure remotely. All of those things really benefit from a SaaS market structure, SaaS market technology. And certainly as they've moved a lot of their compliance and surveillance teams remotely, there's even more demand for our surveillance solutions, because they want to make sure that they're able to propagate this across the firm. So I think those things actually have benefited from the need for people to be more flexible about where people work and having less reliance on their kind of homegrown infrastructure. And so all five of the new clients in the market operators that we signed in the quarter of were SaaS based solution to their all our next generation solutions, both in surveillance and market -- and upgrading. And I think that, in general, our overall demand for those types of services has gone up.  I think the second thing is on the index side. We are continuing to have a lot of great dialogue with our index partners about new products that we can bring to market that do play into the long-term changes in the economy, and making sure that we deliver indexes that investors feel like they can invest in over the coming decades, that will have a positive trend around them. So I think that's another area that we're really focused on Alex that's more COVID related. And then I guess the last thing is on our data analytics platform of Quandl. We are seeing more demand for certain elements of alternative data, because they're trying to get ahead of government data, for instance. So there's really trying to get much better insights into demand and how it's changing and shifting in the world. And I do think that a lot of our Quandl products are relevant there. So those are the things that we're seeing Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\nKen Hill: Hi, good morning. I was hoping to ask about Nasdaq Marketplace Services Platform. So I know you guys launched this at the end of June. You have some detail on the website. And I was hoping you could help me kind of narrow the focus a little bit because it seems to have all -- a lot of great buzzwords in there and have a huge focus which can do a lot of things that a lot of fintechs and exchanges want to do. So I'm hoping to understand maybe how you see it specifically positioned within there? Secondly, you mentioned some early months with LEX there, but then may be who the natural customer base is for this and maybe the addressable market for it here over time?\nAdena Friedman: Yes, no problem. So I think it was funny, we always joke with our marketing department on the buzzwords. So -- but I think that -- let me just kind of break it down. As we think about what we've been investing in over the last several years in market tech, the first thing is, is what we call Nasdaq financial framework, which is really the platform, the core platform that allows for micro service architecture. And what that means is you have this like common data layer, common data management capability, common security layer, a common code based across everything you're building. And that's kind of the core platform regardless of what functionality you put on top of it, and what capabilities you build, it's the common platform that all of our market tech solutions now are built on top of. And then on top of that, you then build capabilities like functionality, trading, prepaid risk management, post trade, processing, settlement, surveillance, things like that. What we've done with the Marketplace Services Platform is essentially completed the trade life cycle in a micro service architecture, so that you can basically deploy a market much faster in the cloud. So everything is fully cloud-native. And you can go and it's a much more kind of a turnkey solution for new markets. So the primary clients for the marketplace services platform are new markets. They could be existing clients that want to launch new markets, they want to launch a resource market or they want to launch something that's in the financial instruments themselves, crypto markets and things like that as well, or it can also be used for these -- kinds of new market concepts that we've been talking about in terms of outside the traditional capital markets. LEX Markets is a real estate securities platform, it\u2019s a really a new construct. And we think that their marketplace services platform is kind of a perfect use case for that. And so it's just really creating a full trade life cycle. Our first iteration of it was the matching engine itself. And now we have a full trade life cycle in that micro service architecture. So, hopefully that helps kind of break down a bit.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open\nBrian Bedell : Let me just shift gears to the expense outlook and appreciate your comment on that Mike. Just kind of -- yes, obviously a very good performance with the operating margin, either continuing to grow and higher here and it looks like the -- about 300 basis points of operating leverage so far, halfway through the year with 6% non-trading revenue growth and 3% op expense. So, maybe as we move into the second half of the year, do you think we can still have that type of operating leverage? And maybe just to throw in a comment on the non-trading revenue growth side, new market technology with a little bit of a [spin] on the new order intake, does that mostly depend on that sales trajectory improvement a little bit in second half? Sorry for all the bundled questions.\nAdena Friedman: That\u2019s okay. So, we\u2019ve got discuss of operating leverage and the discussion of order intake and market tech. So, I just want to make sure Michael, do you have any comments on operating leverage that you want to start with?\nMichael Ptasznik: Well, I think we\u2019ve covered it to some degree in the remarks, Adena, so obviously, the operating leverage is getting the benefit from the additional revenue that we\u2019re receiving on the trading activity and that side of the business. And we continue to, as we said in my remarks, invest in the business. And so we do think that there -- for the full year the overall expense guidance is around that 3% range. So, that's what we're targeting and that's what -- when you look at that, in my remarks we said sort of the mid to the upper end of the range with respect to that expense guidance. That's where we come in around 3% for the full year. And then on the revenue side it's really with respect to what happens with respect to the operating or the revenue activities we have on the trading side, which is what the real driver as to whether it's in a -- stay where it is, increases or decreases, it\u2019s dependent somewhat in the short-term based on the trading activity.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, and then on the order intake question from market tech, I think the question is, are we dependent on the same kinds of order intake for us to thrive our year -- our current year results. And I would say Brian that we certainly continue to see a good pipeline of opportunity with order intake. As I said before, I think that we are seeing a little bit more moderated order intake this year because of the fact that bigger technology decisions are taking longer. So, that kind of chunky big order intakes that we tend to get from our larger clients are taking longer as they're managing through their own situation before making significant changes to their system or launching new things within their markets. But I would say that we do continue to see a healthy pipeline. And as we said before, we do see some risk to our ability to reach the lower end of the growth target for our market tech business this year, just because of some of the challenges in terms of time to sales and the way that we're implementing in a remote environment. But overall, the overall health of that business continues to be really strong and demand for our services continue to be really strong. So, I don't have a specific answer to your question about order intake relative to revenue. I'm hoping that we've given you guys enough understanding of the dynamics we're seeing, for you to look at, to get at the right conclusion there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open. \nMike Carrier: Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're more comfortable on the low end of the non-transactional revenue growth range this year, but expecting some client activity in corporate and tech to be slower, which makes sense. I'm just curious, if you were using this scenario for a longer time period, I think, are you seeing clients -- and obviously I think Nasdaq is but it\u2019d would happy enough that you could eventually see a pickup in orders if we\u2019re in some of this type of environment for a longer period of time? And then Michael if either that is the case and we don't see it pickup in activity, what areas would you have on kind of the expense side for flexibility? \nAdena Friedman: Sure. So I do think that clients are adapting. It's kind of they first had to get through really a surge in volume and a complete change in their operating model. And so they obviously put certain decisions on hold. And then you have the second thing, which is, okay, now we've got to deal with this new normal. And what does it mean for our business? And so how much -- how far are we going to lean in on new enhancements or new products, new markets? I think though, however, there was just an enormous amount of kind of momentum and demand coming into the year for new markets to launch, for people to try, to put more instruments on their platforms and for them to really thrive for frankly a more flexible infrastructure. And so I don't think there's decisions that are really put on hold forever. Mike I think that a lot of them are just taking a little bit longer, so they know exactly how they're going to make that capital allocation decisions while they manage through a longer term environment. The other thing I would say is obviously the exchange world in general has done -- has performed well. And the -- obviously the markets have performed well. I think that the volume activity is not just here in the United States, but it's in other countries as well. And so the overall resilience of the business models of our customers make it so that those types of decisions might take a little longer but obviously be made because they definitely see the benefit of modernizing their infrastructure. On the broker dealer side, I think that a lot of -- some of the sales have been more on those immediate needs, and that's why our surveillance sales have been really strong. But over time, broker dealers also want to optimize their infrastructure. They're going to prioritize things that where they're making money, and they are making money in trading. So we do think that those are opportunities also in the long-term to revert back to where we were seeing demand before. And then I'll turn it over to Michael on the question on expenses. \nMichael Ptasznik : Yes, I think, it's just a bit of an extension of what Adena was saying with respect to. We look at the expenses in the context of the revenue. And so if we're in a period where this is continuing, and then obviously along with that there's good chance for uncertainty. So we'll be seeing good revenue or activity on the transactional side of the business. So that goes through really the resiliency of the business, but obviously in an environment that we're sitting in, we are seeing the benefit of reduced levels of spending on some of the discretionary spend or things like travel, our marketing events have moved online, and so you save some of the in-person costs and the cost of hosting those events and we have moved those online, but then there are some savings that's related to that. So we obviously always look at our discretionary spend and we'll look at the non-essential initiatives that we're looking at as an organization that you do over the longer term, but we're definitely going to and I want to make sure, we're clear about this in continuation of my remarks that we're continuing to invest in the capacity and the infrastructure to meet the markets' demands. In addition to that, we will continue to invest in the long-term growth initiatives for the business. And so we will look to manage expenses where we can and where possible, but we will continue to invest for the future. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. \nChris Harris : So there was a decent sized drop in the U.S. options capture rate in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on there and then is this a good run rate would you say for U.S. options capture? \nAdena Friedman : Sure. So the U.S. options capture is really a function of the level of retail that's come into the options markets, because they -- those types of orders tend to gravitate towards the price time market as opposed to the floor-based markets or the complex markets like we have in ISE. So that -- and as you know the price time markets tend to have a lower capture. So I do think it's much more of a trend of retail. Now whether or not that trend will continue over the long-term is something that we all we'd like to see in general, because while the capture is lower, the volumes are up, right? So you have to kind of look at it, it's a balance there. And so, in general, we feel that having more participation in the market, more varied participation in the markets and more democratization of the market, these are all good things for the capital markets in general. And so I would say we just firstly just have to -- we'll have to see how much, how resilient the retail is. But I would say that you should look at it more as a function of that as opposed to concrete or discrete decisions that we've made. It's more just where the volume is going. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. \nAlex Blostein : I was hoping to get to the Infra Services segment for a second. Could you guys talk a little bit about sources of growth particularly around the U.S. prop business this quarter as well as the pickup in investment in data products that there also seems like to be pretty nice pickup sequentially. So maybe a little bit more color there would be helpful? \nAdena Friedman : Sure. Yes. Sure. So on the prop products, our proprietary products, we are continuing to find demand for our products particularly as frankly the retail investing dynamic continues to increase. I think that more and more of the retail brokerage firms and those firms that are really geared towards retail investors want to have access to real-time information and we offered in a really flexible way. And so and we worked very hard to be highly competitive with our peers, in terms of offering us superior products at a great price. So that has been an area of growth for us as we've continued to expand the usage of our data across the broader capital markets ecosystem. I think that in terms of the data and analytics business, it's been driven by couple of things. First, we still continue to have good growth in eVestment, although, it's somewhat moderated from last year, because we've been really working very hard to really solidify the core value proposition that we have for clients. We changed our pricing model last year and it's actually really benefiting the resiliency of that business this year, the usage of our data and analytics this year on eVestment. And it's kind of setting us up to really continue to drive new -- growth for new product delivery. So we've had actually a 39% increase in the usage of eVestment this year over last year and that's really because more and more of the C-Suite of the asset managers are really picking up and leveraging the eVestment data to make more strategic decisions around how they want to launch products or allocate their assets to different investment strategies. And I think that will give us a really good position to grow and expand the product base there. We also have the benefit of Solovis coming in and also driving growth. They've had, they have strong demand for their services. And we signed our first kind of Solovis client on the back of being an eVestment client. So we are opening doors through our eVestment relationships for the Solovis product. So I think all of those things are the reasons why we're seeing healthy growth in that business, but we're also shoring up the resiliency of the business with the change in the pricing. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open. \nKyle Voigt : So maybe just one on the index business. I wonder if you can update on how much of that index revenue line is driven by AUM base fees now. I think, last update was around 60%. And I'm wondering if you could help us understand the average fees on assets benchmark to that NASDAQ-100. I think primarily the Qs where the AUM is up 54% year-over-year versus the total AUM up 34%. Just wondering if there is some favorable mix shift going on there on top of the really strong growth?  A - Adena Friedman  So in general and I just want to make sure, we've been looking at this in terms of percentage of our revenue in the index business that comes from AUM-driven revenue versus the futures volumes and the data revenue. And about 60% to 65% of the revenue in the index business comes from AUM and that's kind of an average over the last -- or a range that we've experienced over the last few years. And somewhere in the range of kind of 10% to 20% comes from the futures volumes. It really just depends on the quarter in terms of the level of activity there. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of a sense of the scale. In terms of the fee base, we don't publish fees specifically to index businesses or our specific indexes that we launch with our clients, but I would say that the NASDAQ-100 Index program, in the way that the partners that we have with Invesco is a long standing evergreen partnership. So that the fee base within the NAS-100 has been the same for a long time. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. \nAri Ghosh : So Adena just circling back to your comments on the index business. If I look at the recent performance, it's especially noteworthy given that even outside of market beta organic net flow growth, I believe is accelerated to around 15% range and is outpacing industry trends. So could you just talk about some of the differentiating factors and notes around your index business versus some of the larger index players in the industry? And then looking ahead just curious where you see the most room for product innovation. Is it around the smart beta, ESG or some other white space out there where you see the most opportunities? Yes, just as we think about, you're looking at avenues not to hit that medium-term growth targets in the index business. \nAdena Friedman : Sure. So I think that first thing, I would say is, the NASDAQ-100 and the Nasdaq Biotech Indexes are just great foundational franchises for us. And then we have a very, I think, actually a great cadre of smart beta indices that also have done quite well in terms of just leaning into overall thematic trends. So I just think that we've been pretty good at selecting the types of themes that we want to launch in our index business. We're little bit more, I would say, of a niche type of player. We don't do every index that you can possibly imagine. We really do, work very closely with our partners to launch products that we think will have really strong investor demand, but also playing to trend. So the trends that we've seen has been highly successful are trends around technology, cloud indices, IT security indices, biotech indices and obviously the flagship NASDAQ-100, which is a -- which has a lot of waiting towards the technology sector in general, but it is actually a broad-based index that has a lot of sectors in there, but technology is obviously the most prevalent. So I think it's just that, our market as well as the indices that we build around our market trends are I think just playing into the next generation of our economy. And I think as a result of that we've had -- this resilience. And even you know in other down periods like in 2018 in the fourth quarter, we did not have as much reduction AUM, because even if the market performance was down for the quarter, we saw a lot of inflows coming in which offsets, obviously drops the market performance. In this particular case that's why we noted in my remarks that over 60% of the increase in AUM was actually from inflows not just market performance, because it does tell you that we're leaning into a lot of long-term trends with our indexes. So hopefully that answers your question, Ari, on that. \nOperator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up from Alex Kramm from UBS. Your line is open. \nAlex Kramm : Quick one, maybe -- maybe not. You mentioned -- Adena, you mentioned ESG three times in your prepared remarks today. So just curious if you can give us a little bit more color, which is obviously a super fast growing macro trend. And so any idea how big ESG is for you today, how fast it's been growing and where you see how much of an impact you can make in the future in terms of potential growth here? \nAdena Friedman : Sure. Yes. And that actually goes to Ari's second question which I didn't answer, which is, where do we see the bigger trends going forward in the index business. And ESG is certainly one of the big macro trends, and it is an area that we want to make sure that we again, in a very specific way that we are also playing into the ESG trend. We're trying to make sure that we do, for instance ESG versions of the OMXS30. We have other ESG thematic indexes that we're launching with our partners. So that's one area of ESG that we're definitely focused on, but it's still very small for us, Alex. I think that -- the other is actually in our corporate services business, where we did make a very small acquisition in a company called OneReport, but that is really catalyzed demand from our corporate clients. So I think our largest near-term opportunity, but still coming off of, we just launched the ESG advisory service like 18 months ago. So this is still pretty new. It's really helping our customers navigate a very complex environment around ESG reporting, making it easier for them to report their information by putting it into one place and having one repository that we then translate and map out to all the metrics providers.  Ultimately, we're going to want to expand that. So we can actually map that directly into institutional investors\u2019 databases. And then additionally making sure that we capture this -- that information and make it so we can provide our corporate clients with more reports on their own trending, how they're trending against peers things like that. So that they can get more intelligence from all of the work they're doing around ESG. And I think that, so we see that as kind of a short-term in terms of really building up our consulting capabilities as well as our technology service to make it easier for them to review the reporting and then long term as we really create even more intelligence for our corporate clients and for institutional investors on overall trends in that. And then the last area of ESG that we're focused on, but again it's still very small from a revenue perspective, but we definitely see a lot of growing demand for it, is in the Nasdaq sustainability bond index, I'm sorry Nasdaq sustainable bond index -- network, which is really kind of -- in Europe it's a sustainable bond market where they list their bonds and make them available to investors in Europe. In the U.S., it's not yet a market, but it's essentially a listing venue for people to come in and we do a lot of work to make sure we invest in the bonds and other financing instruments around sustainability and confirm that they are, in fact, meeting sustainability needs and giving those companies access to the markets through those sustainability bond network, sorry, but that's still again small. So if I were to rank, order them in terms of near-term opportunity I would say that corporate products that we're launching are definitely the highest near-term opportunities, but all three of them have good long-term opportunities for growth for us, Alex. \nAlex Kramm : Okay, but too early to give any sort of corporate-wide ESG metrics or revenues like some of your information services PSR are already doing. \nAdena Friedman : Yes. No, I would say it's too early for us. And they are kind of embedded in different segments. So it's not something we pull together as one number. \nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn it back to Ms. Adena Friedman for closing remarks. \nAdena Friedman : Okay, great. Well thank you all very much for your time today. We are very pleased to see that our businesses are delivering strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. Guided by our strategic direction, we have a clear focus to finish 2020 strong as we re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow, and we are committing to executing our plans diligently while keeping our employees safe and set up for success while in the remote environment. So, but thank you very much and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. I would like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I am of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients and the communities in which we live during these last few months. With the second quarter being our first full period with a vast majority of our global workforce working remotely, I could not be more proud with the results that we have delivered for our stakeholders amid what is still a very unprecedented time. The executive leadership team and I are acutely aware that our colleagues, clients and so many of our stakeholders are tackling work, family and health responsibilities simultaneously. We are in the fortunate position that our business can operate in a remote working environment globally. And we've remained highly productive and available to our clients throughout this period. That said, we also recognize that some of our team members prefer the opportunity to work in an office environment. And over the long-term, we believe that there are social and creativity benefits that come from working together physically. Therefore, we are working to reopen our offices in a deliberate way as the virus subsides to specific cities and countries where we operate. And we are taking a very measured approach to the reopening of our offices that prioritizes our employees' health and safety. In that regard, we will continue to make it completely voluntary until at least year-end 2020 for our employees to choose to return to our offices. The second quarter was marked not only by the deepening impact of the global health crisis, but by the escalation and recognition of the social injustices across many communities around us. We are committed to creating lasting, positive change and I'll highlight two examples. Last month, we announced immediate actions to strengthen our continued commitment to diversity and inclusion. In addition to our $5 million first quarter pledge to COVID-19 relief, in the second quarter we pledged an additional $3 million in cash donations to organizations serving underserved minority communities and fighting the impacts of the health crisis. In addition, as we look at Nasdaq's broader purpose in the communities where we operate, particularly as a proponent of inclusive growth and prosperity, we see the Nasdaq Foundation as a core component of our societal mission. As a result, in addition to committing to an annual contribution to the Foundation of approximately one quarter of a percent of operating profit starting in 2021, we also made a one-time capital injection in Q2 of this year of $10 million to improve the funded position of the Foundation and to support its refined mission. We will update the market as we announce specific campaigns designed to support our Foundation's objectives. There's also a lot of momentum inside of Nasdaq to improve and accelerate our efforts to advance our culture. Therefore, we're increasing our internal resources devoted to programs focused on diversity-oriented professional development, employee experience and talent acquisition. Our ultimate ambition is for the Nasdaq team to reflect the diversity of the populations of each of the countries where we operate, and to provide a performance-driven culture that demonstrates respect and belonging for all of our employees. We are fully committed to taking the necessary steps in the months and years ahead to achieve this ambition.  This starts with publishing our diversity statistics from countries where we are permitted to collect that data, which we will start to do by the end of the third quarter. These will serve as an honest assessment of where we are and how far we need to progress. Nasdaq has always had a strong commitment to all three elements of ESG, environmental, social and governance practices. We believe our societal efforts will further enhance our position as a leader that is continuously striving to improve.  Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the second quarter of 2020. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $699 million, an increase of $76 million, or 12% from the prior year period, driven almost entirely by organic growth. I'm incredibly proud to report that once again each of our four business segments delivered positive organic growth during the quarter, a testament to the resiliency of our business and the dedication of the Nasdaq team under the new remote working environment.  Net revenues in our Market Services business grew 22% while revenues in our non-trading segments grew 7% from the prior period. On an organic basis, revenues across the non-trading segments increased 6% year-over-year, with growth from acquisitions contributing 1% to total growth. Operating leverage was particularly strong as expenses were up slightly during the period resulting in the non-GAAP operating margin expanding nearly 500 basis points to 53% and contributing to non-GAAP EPS growth of 26%.  Turning now to the specific highlights from the second quarter, I will also briefly address the evolving industry and client dynamics we're observing and how we see these influencing our performance for the remainder of 2020. I will begin with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $276 million, a 22% increase from the prior year period. This was led by higher cash equity trading and equity derivatives revenue amidst the continued surge in volumes for cash equities and equity linked derivatives. These elevated volumes were driven not only by evolving expectations around the pandemic's implications, but by the way the pandemic seems to be accelerating certain long-term dynamics that have spurred significant sector rotations in the market. We said last quarter that the volume outlooks set up constructively due to both this pandemic's uncertainties and the fact that 2020 finishes with the U.S. presidential elections. A quarter later, we increasingly expect that the current economic and political backdrop will continue to support elevated volumes during the latter half of the year.  Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenues of $126 million, a 2% increase, boosted by a return in newly -- new listing activity and continued demand for our Investor Relations intelligence solutions, as well as higher revenues from corporate governance solutions. After returning to organic growth in 2019, our IR and governance businesses saw an acceleration in the first half of this year driving 8% organic growth in Corporate Solutions in the second quarter, excluding a 2% impact due to unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Our IR advisory services including our relatively new ESG advisory solution were top contributors in the period. We believe the restructured and repositioned Corporate Solutions product suite has a much stronger alignment with the secular trends that are driving our corporate clients' interactions with their investing community, and other stakeholders.  That said, we did experience reduced demand from corporate clients in sectors that are highly impacted by the effects of the pandemic, such as travel, retail, energy and financials where focus on expense control has become a priority. Additionally, prospect engagement in a vortical environment has created longer sales cycles for some of our corporate services. Recognizing that these impacts could change quarter-to-quarter, we have endeavoured to provide our clients with near term savings opportunities within the context of what are meant to be continued and eventually rebounding long-term relationships. In our Listing segment Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 42 IPOs for a 67% win rate. For the first six months of 2020, we welcomed 69 IPOs, representing 69% of all US-IPOs. Our IPOs have raised $17.4 billion, which represents 66% of total IPO capital raised in the United States. Excluding SPAC, we have welcomed 55 operating company IPOs for an 85% win rate in the first half of the year. Listing highlights from the second quarter include three of the top four largest IPOs by capital raise, including Royalty Pharma, the largest U.S. IPO of 2020 to-date; Warner Music Group; and ZoomInfo, the largest technology IPO of the year. Notable SPAC listings during the period included DraftKings and Nikola Motor Company. The reopening of the IPO window is very encouraging. We have seen a steady inflow of listings from technology and healthcare, industries illustrative of the kinds of companies innovating to solve some of society's most pressing challenges, which are finding a very receptive audience with investors. Companies are also responding positively to Nasdaq's virtual experience during IPOs reflecting -- reflected in our market leading win rate. Feedback from newly listed companies and also importantly from the investment banking and underwriting communities have been tremendous.  Our partners appreciate the seamless manner in which we transitioned our IPO first trade process once we changed our operation to remote environment in March. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we see a very healthy pipeline of companies looking to tap public markets with many intending to execute again ahead of the November U.S. presidential election.  Now let me turn to our technology and analytics businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $84 million in revenue and signed $38 million in new order intake. Our annualized recurring revenue in the quarter was $268 million, a 9% increase year-over-year. New order intake overall was moderate during the period as client decision making around large scaled technology projects has slowed during the pandemic. Looking within the product offerings, we note that we had strong new order intake in Nasdaq trade surveillance, a SaaS offering focused on our broker dealer clients. And we signed 5 new marketplace technology customers, all of which were signed after virtual sales process and all of whom selected our SaaS delivered market technology solutions. We were also excited to announce during the second quarter the launch of Nasdaq's Marketplace Services platform to provide our market technology clients with seamless access to standard cloud-based infrastructure component and full trade lifecycle capabilities as they move to the next phase of their digitalization. This service was announced alongside signing of our first client LEX Markets, which will leverage our cloud masking services to power their trading platform for commercial real estate securities. There is heightened interest in the ways that our next generation technology, particularly the SaaS capabilities that we have built into both market infrastructure and surveillance products can help our clients deal with heightened scalability and flexibility challenges that the pandemic brings. These examples also highlight how we've made significant strides in adapting the ways that our technologists are performing in a more remote work environment. Still implementation projects, new order intake levels and funding for new markets initiatives have been modestly impacted by pandemic-related factors. We continue to expect to see the short-term mostly logistical growth headwinds that increase the risk of the market technology being below the bottom of our medium term growth objectives for the current year. Turning to our Information Services segment, we delivered net revenues of $213 million, up $19 million or 10% from the prior year period. Index AUM rose to $272 billion at the end of the period, up 34% versus the prior year, and eclipsing a previous quarter end high of $233 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019. Index revenue was $68 million, up 24% year-over-year, with contributions driven primarily by the increase in ETP licensed product AUM and secondarily from fees generated from trading of licensed futures. We're incredibly pleased with the strength and resilience of our flagship index products during the quarter. We believe that the Nasdaq Composite and the NASDAQ-100 performance reflects investor interest in the companies that are supporting the modern infrastructure for tomorrow's economy, workforce and workplace. Year-to-date, AUM in all ETPs licensed to Nasdaq's indices are up over $40 billion and almost 26% of that increase or $64 -- $26 billion, sorry, of that increase or 64% came from net investor inflows to the products, with the remainder from market performance during the year.  While this segment is sensitive to what can be reversals in exogenous market beta and futures volume trends, there's no ignoring that the second quarter's positive results put us in a better position for a full year performance. Our Investment Data & Analytics revenues increased 13% from the prior year period, including the contribution of Solovis which we acquired in March. While 2020 organic growth of eVestment is seeing some impact from budget tightening on the part of the buy side, the addition of Solovis' real time performance and risk modelling gives us more opportunities to catalyze allocation decisions on the part of asset owners, decisions that in turn are higher usage of eVestments -- of leading asset manager research and selection tools.  Revenue in Market Data saw modest organic growth during the period and continues to deliver consistent results. We've seen relatively stable performance and expectations in our Market Data products.  And finally for the third quarter -- for the third consecutive quarter, the majority of our revenues in the Information Services business came from the index licensing and investment in analytics products are a direct result of focusing our investments into expanding our capabilities in higher growth areas within Information Services.  So, after reviewing each business, collectively, what does this mean from our investors' perspective? Well, overall, we continue to benefit from a business model that delivers well during challenging times, due to the resilient and diversified nature of our business. With our diversity of offerings and customers, we benefit from certain segments, bolstering our results when others face some short-term pressures. That has been the story of Nasdaq for many years now, and overall it provides for more stability and predictability than many of our direct peers. We continue to see 2020 as an elevated risk environment related to the pandemic's implications, and related changes to client purchasing behaviors could continue building in some portions of the business as the year progresses. But we also recognize that the strong performance for our index business and the rebound in demand for IPOs has us feeling directionally more optimistic than we were three months ago.  On the last quarter call we referenced our long-term outlook of 5% to 7% annualized growth in our non-trading businesses. As we experienced the early days of the pandemic's impact on the economy, we communicated that we saw risks in our ability to achieve the lower end of that growth range in 2020. Given the strength of our second quarter performance, we believe that the risks have moderated somewhat. Therefore, there's -- unless there's a sharp reversal in the current environment, our confidence has increased in our ability to achieve the lower end of our 5% to 7% organic revenue growth range collectively across our non-trading businesses for the full year of 2020. We will continue to provide updates on our growth progress as we address our third quarter results in October.  In addition to the strong results from our businesses this quarter, we also saw positive developments on the regulatory front in the period. In June, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled decisively against the SEC on two issues that were very important to us. First, the court's rule that the SEC exceeded its legal authority by creating a process to review fees long after they've taken effect. The rule vacated or invalidated the SEC's actions in October 2018, when it overturned the ruling of its own administrative law judge that proprietary data prices were properly regulated and constrained by competition and mandated the review of hundreds of other fees. Second, the court's rule that the SEC's excess fee pilot was on unauthorized because the SEC lacks the authority to adopt rules and impose obligations if their sole purpose is to gather data. For the commission to regulate, it must identify a problem and justify its proposed solutions with sufficient economic analysis of the cost, benefits and possible alternatives. The pilot would have subjected thousands of U.S. issuers to a multi-year experiment to determine what might happen if liquidity incenting rebates and exchanges were restricted or eliminated.  We continue to believe that the U.S. stock markets are the envy of the world delivering unmatched liquidity and resiliency at extremely low cost in a highly competitive environment. We hope that as the SEC moves forward in its efforts to find ways to improve the markets, they do so with the utmost thoughtfulness to ensure that reforms fully deliver benefits across a wide range of issuers, intermediaries and investors that depend on them. Going forward, we urge the SEC to adopt a more inclusive approach to developing consensus around rule proposals and significant rule changes, particularly when those changes are wide ranging and carry a significant risk of unintended consequences.  As we look to the second half of 2020 and beyond, we now know that we will be navigating a world and economy characterized by the pandemic's effects for longer than we were expecting. We've also learned important lessons during this period that bolsters our confidence in our longer term strategy to maximize opportunities as a leading technology and analytics provider while maintaining our foundational marketplace focused businesses.  Importantly, we observed several key trends that underscore the flexibility of our strategic ambitions to serve markets everywhere. For example, we're now able to reach a new set of clients and finalize deals in our Market Technology business using our SaaS-based solutions, which provide more turnkey and scalable market capabilities for our clients in a fast changing economic environment.  While our index business will always be subject to cyclical beta related impacts due to the nature of its revenue model, we have seen a new appreciation for the thematic approaches that characterize majority of Nasdaq's index franchise. And of course, the good fortune to be in the right thematic for a world that is changing in ways that make technology and healthcare more important to everyone's lives than ever.  Additionally, our institutional investor clients are increasingly turning to a data-driven decision making in a volatile and unpredictable environment, which underscores the value of our data analytics offering. And lastly, over recent years, there's been a growing urgency among companies globally to make a positive contribution to the environment and to focus on governance practices. This year, the focus on the pandemic and its impact on our society and in particular on our underserved communities, has elevated a commitment from the private sector to key areas of social responsibility as well. As a result, we're starting to be rewarded for our efforts to expand our offerings, addressing corporate issuers and other clients' rising ESG needs.  As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that Nasdaq remains sharply focused on advancing our strategic mission. Our global team has demonstrated their seamless adjustment to the remote nature of our current operating environment. And our team's ability to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients has demonstrated in our strong results this past quarter.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details. Sure. Well, I would agree that retail participation in the markets, but the equities markets and the equity options markets has been -- certainly has been elevated this year. And you are right, that it is resulting in more off-exchange volume occurring. I think that what we've been really focused on is, for the volume that does, that come to the exchanges, what can we do to maximize our position? And so we've been working really hard right on a few fronts. One is, certainly just overall customer service and availability. Second is, just the scalability of our business and ability to handle these really large volume days, particularly like the Russell and the S&P 500 rebalance days. Third is that we continue to improve the performance of our systems with tech improvements and things that we're doing to make sure that we optimize the performance of our markets. And then the last thing is making sure that we really educate our customers on how to use all the elements of our markets, like our M-ELO orders and other things like that to capture as much volume as we can, but the retail volume generally gets internalized. And then of course turns into secondary volume that comes to the exchanges. So we do benefit from the overall elevated environment, but we do find that the level of internalization is something that we watch pretty carefully. Because you don't want there to be a diminishment of the price discovery that's occurring in the market by having too much of the volume go [off-exchange]. So it's something that we certainly are focused on. I think the one thing that we are focused on, Rich, is just making sure retail investors are educated as they're coming into the markets. The online retail brokers do a really good job of that. FINRA does a really good job of that. So we're just partnering with them to make sure that we're helping them with their educational efforts with the retail investors. So the revenue capture, it's really a function of a lot of things. So one is just which markets are they leveraging to come into the market and therefore what's our capture rate. I think we also are -- we're very careful in looking at how much volume is coming into the auctions. We did have two very large auctions in the quarter -- at the end of the quarter with the S&P500. I think that was 1.2 billion shares. And the Russell rebalance was 1.5 billion shares. And there's obviously Craigslist as well in terms of the options versus the intraday trading. No, actually, I think a couple of areas, Alex, I think it is actually relevant. So the first is how the demand for more of our SaaS-based technology is actually elevated during this period, because I think more and more the clients are realizing that to have the scalability and the flexibility they want to be able to have what I would take has to be on demand, to be able to manage their infrastructure remotely. All of those things really benefit from a SaaS market structure, SaaS market technology. And certainly as they've moved a lot of their compliance and surveillance teams remotely, there's even more demand for our surveillance solutions, because they want to make sure that they're able to propagate this across the firm. So I think those things actually have benefited from the need for people to be more flexible about where people work and having less reliance on their kind of homegrown infrastructure. And so all five of the new clients in the market operators that we signed in the quarter of were SaaS based solution to their all our next generation solutions, both in surveillance and market -- and upgrading. And I think that, in general, our overall demand for those types of services has gone up.  I think the second thing is on the index side. We are continuing to have a lot of great dialogue with our index partners about new products that we can bring to market that do play into the long-term changes in the economy, and making sure that we deliver indexes that investors feel like they can invest in over the coming decades, that will have a positive trend around them. So I think that's another area that we're really focused on Alex that's more COVID related. And then I guess the last thing is on our data analytics platform of Quandl. We are seeing more demand for certain elements of alternative data, because they're trying to get ahead of government data, for instance. So there's really trying to get much better insights into demand and how it's changing and shifting in the world. And I do think that a lot of our Quandl products are relevant there. So those are the things that we're seeing Alex. Yes, no problem. So I think it was funny, we always joke with our marketing department on the buzzwords. So -- but I think that -- let me just kind of break it down. As we think about what we've been investing in over the last several years in market tech, the first thing is, is what we call Nasdaq financial framework, which is really the platform, the core platform that allows for micro service architecture. And what that means is you have this like common data layer, common data management capability, common security layer, a common code based across everything you're building. And that's kind of the core platform regardless of what functionality you put on top of it, and what capabilities you build, it's the common platform that all of our market tech solutions now are built on top of. And then on top of that, you then build capabilities like functionality, trading, prepaid risk management, post trade, processing, settlement, surveillance, things like that. What we've done with the Marketplace Services Platform is essentially completed the trade life cycle in a micro service architecture, so that you can basically deploy a market much faster in the cloud. So everything is fully cloud-native. And you can go and it's a much more kind of a turnkey solution for new markets. So the primary clients for the marketplace services platform are new markets. They could be existing clients that want to launch new markets, they want to launch a resource market or they want to launch something that's in the financial instruments themselves, crypto markets and things like that as well, or it can also be used for these -- kinds of new market concepts that we've been talking about in terms of outside the traditional capital markets. LEX Markets is a real estate securities platform, it's a really a new construct. And we think that their marketplace services platform is kind of a perfect use case for that. And so it's just really creating a full trade life cycle. Our first iteration of it was the matching engine itself. And now we have a full trade life cycle in that micro service architecture. So, hopefully that helps kind of break down a bit. That's okay. So, we've got discuss of operating leverage and the discussion of order intake and market tech. So, I just want to make sure Michael, do you have any comments on operating leverage that you want to start with? Yes, and then on the order intake question from market tech, I think the question is, are we dependent on the same kinds of order intake for us to thrive our year -- our current year results. And I would say Brian that we certainly continue to see a good pipeline of opportunity with order intake. As I said before, I think that we are seeing a little bit more moderated order intake this year because of the fact that bigger technology decisions are taking longer. So, that kind of chunky big order intakes that we tend to get from our larger clients are taking longer as they're managing through their own situation before making significant changes to their system or launching new things within their markets. But I would say that we do continue to see a healthy pipeline. And as we said before, we do see some risk to our ability to reach the lower end of the growth target for our market tech business this year, just because of some of the challenges in terms of time to sales and the way that we're implementing in a remote environment. But overall, the overall health of that business continues to be really strong and demand for our services continue to be really strong. So, I don't have a specific answer to your question about order intake relative to revenue. I'm hoping that we've given you guys enough understanding of the dynamics we're seeing, for you to look at, to get at the right conclusion there. Sure. So I do think that clients are adapting. It's kind of they first had to get through really a surge in volume and a complete change in their operating model. And so they obviously put certain decisions on hold. And then you have the second thing, which is, okay, now we've got to deal with this new normal. And what does it mean for our business? And so how much -- how far are we going to lean in on new enhancements or new products, new markets? I think though, however, there was just an enormous amount of kind of momentum and demand coming into the year for new markets to launch, for people to try, to put more instruments on their platforms and for them to really thrive for frankly a more flexible infrastructure. And so I don't think there's decisions that are really put on hold forever. Mike I think that a lot of them are just taking a little bit longer, so they know exactly how they're going to make that capital allocation decisions while they manage through a longer term environment. The other thing I would say is obviously the exchange world in general has done -- has performed well. And the -- obviously the markets have performed well. I think that the volume activity is not just here in the United States, but it's in other countries as well. And so the overall resilience of the business models of our customers make it so that those types of decisions might take a little longer but obviously be made because they definitely see the benefit of modernizing their infrastructure. On the broker dealer side, I think that a lot of -- some of the sales have been more on those immediate needs, and that's why our surveillance sales have been really strong. But over time, broker dealers also want to optimize their infrastructure. They're going to prioritize things that where they're making money, and they are making money in trading. So we do think that those are opportunities also in the long-term to revert back to where we were seeing demand before. And then I'll turn it over to Michael on the question on expenses. Sure. So the U.S. options capture is really a function of the level of retail that's come into the options markets, because they -- those types of orders tend to gravitate towards the price time market as opposed to the floor-based markets or the complex markets like we have in ISE. So that -- and as you know the price time markets tend to have a lower capture. So I do think it's much more of a trend of retail. Now whether or not that trend will continue over the long-term is something that we all we'd like to see in general, because while the capture is lower, the volumes are up, right? So you have to kind of look at it, it's a balance there. And so, in general, we feel that having more participation in the market, more varied participation in the markets and more democratization of the market, these are all good things for the capital markets in general. And so I would say we just firstly just have to -- we'll have to see how much, how resilient the retail is. But I would say that you should look at it more as a function of that as opposed to concrete or discrete decisions that we've made. It's more just where the volume is going. Sure. Yes. Sure. So on the prop products, our proprietary products, we are continuing to find demand for our products particularly as frankly the retail investing dynamic continues to increase. I think that more and more of the retail brokerage firms and those firms that are really geared towards retail investors want to have access to real-time information and we offered in a really flexible way. And so and we worked very hard to be highly competitive with our peers, in terms of offering us superior products at a great price. So that has been an area of growth for us as we've continued to expand the usage of our data across the broader capital markets ecosystem. I think that in terms of the data and analytics business, it's been driven by couple of things. First, we still continue to have good growth in eVestment, although, it's somewhat moderated from last year, because we've been really working very hard to really solidify the core value proposition that we have for clients. We changed our pricing model last year and it's actually really benefiting the resiliency of that business this year, the usage of our data and analytics this year on eVestment. And it's kind of setting us up to really continue to drive new -- growth for new product delivery. So we've had actually a 39% increase in the usage of eVestment this year over last year and that's really because more and more of the C-Suite of the asset managers are really picking up and leveraging the eVestment data to make more strategic decisions around how they want to launch products or allocate their assets to different investment strategies. And I think that will give us a really good position to grow and expand the product base there. We also have the benefit of Solovis coming in and also driving growth. They've had, they have strong demand for their services. And we signed our first kind of Solovis client on the back of being an eVestment client. So we are opening doors through our eVestment relationships for the Solovis product. So I think all of those things are the reasons why we're seeing healthy growth in that business, but we're also shoring up the resiliency of the business with the change in the pricing. Sure. So I think that first thing, I would say is, the NASDAQ-100 and the Nasdaq Biotech Indexes are just great foundational franchises for us. And then we have a very, I think, actually a great cadre of smart beta indices that also have done quite well in terms of just leaning into overall thematic trends. So I just think that we've been pretty good at selecting the types of themes that we want to launch in our index business. We're little bit more, I would say, of a niche type of player. We don't do every index that you can possibly imagine. We really do, work very closely with our partners to launch products that we think will have really strong investor demand, but also playing to trend. So the trends that we've seen has been highly successful are trends around technology, cloud indices, IT security indices, biotech indices and obviously the flagship NASDAQ-100, which is a -- which has a lot of waiting towards the technology sector in general, but it is actually a broad-based index that has a lot of sectors in there, but technology is obviously the most prevalent. So I think it's just that, our market as well as the indices that we build around our market trends are I think just playing into the next generation of our economy. And I think as a result of that we've had -- this resilience. And even you know in other down periods like in 2018 in the fourth quarter, we did not have as much reduction AUM, because even if the market performance was down for the quarter, we saw a lot of inflows coming in which offsets, obviously drops the market performance. In this particular case that's why we noted in my remarks that over 60% of the increase in AUM was actually from inflows not just market performance, because it does tell you that we're leaning into a lot of long-term trends with our indexes. So hopefully that answers your question, Ari, on that. Sure. Yes. And that actually goes to Ari's second question which I didn't answer, which is, where do we see the bigger trends going forward in the index business. And ESG is certainly one of the big macro trends, and it is an area that we want to make sure that we again, in a very specific way that we are also playing into the ESG trend. We're trying to make sure that we do, for instance ESG versions of the OMXS30. We have other ESG thematic indexes that we're launching with our partners. So that's one area of ESG that we're definitely focused on, but it's still very small for us, Alex. I think that -- the other is actually in our corporate services business, where we did make a very small acquisition in a company called OneReport, but that is really catalyzed demand from our corporate clients. So I think our largest near-term opportunity, but still coming off of, we just launched the ESG advisory service like 18 months ago. So this is still pretty new. It's really helping our customers navigate a very complex environment around ESG reporting, making it easier for them to report their information by putting it into one place and having one repository that we then translate and map out to all the metrics providers.  Ultimately, we're going to want to expand that. So we can actually map that directly into institutional investors' databases. And then additionally making sure that we capture this -- that information and make it so we can provide our corporate clients with more reports on their own trending, how they're trending against peers things like that. So that they can get more intelligence from all of the work they're doing around ESG. And I think that, so we see that as kind of a short-term in terms of really building up our consulting capabilities as well as our technology service to make it easier for them to review the reporting and then long term as we really create even more intelligence for our corporate clients and for institutional investors on overall trends in that. And then the last area of ESG that we're focused on, but again it's still very small from a revenue perspective, but we definitely see a lot of growing demand for it, is in the Nasdaq sustainability bond index, I'm sorry Nasdaq sustainable bond index -- network, which is really kind of -- in Europe it's a sustainable bond market where they list their bonds and make them available to investors in Europe. In the U.S., it's not yet a market, but it's essentially a listing venue for people to come in and we do a lot of work to make sure we invest in the bonds and other financing instruments around sustainability and confirm that they are, in fact, meeting sustainability needs and giving those companies access to the markets through those sustainability bond network, sorry, but that's still again small. So if I were to rank, order them in terms of near-term opportunity I would say that corporate products that we're launching are definitely the highest near-term opportunities, but all three of them have good long-term opportunities for growth for us, Alex. Yes. No, I would say it's too early for us. And they are kind of embedded in different segments. So it's not something we pull together as one number. Okay, great. Well thank you all very much for your time today. We are very pleased to see that our businesses are delivering strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. Guided by our strategic direction, we have a clear focus to finish 2020 strong as we re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow, and we are committing to executing our plans diligently while keeping our employees safe and set up for success while in the remote environment. So, but thank you very much and have a great day."

            "name": "Michael Ptasznik",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. My commentary will be primarily focused on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as any file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages 4 and 14. The $76 million increase in reported net revenue of $699 million is a net result of organic growth of $75 million including 22% organic increase in Market Services and 6% organic growth in the non-trading segments, a $3 million positive impact from acquisitions, and a $2 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of the reporting segments. I will start with Information Services, which as reflected on pages 5 and 14 saw a $19 million or 10% increase in revenue. Organic revenue growth during the period was 9%, primarily reflecting very strong growth in our index business and then smaller but positive contributions from each of the Investment Data & Analytics and Market Data businesses. Operating margin of 62% declined about 1 point compared to the prior year period, primarily due to the inclusion of Solovis. Market Technology revenue, as shown on pages 6 and 14, increased $5 million, or 6%, with organic growth of $4 million, or 5%. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in Software-as-a-Service surveillance revenues. As Adena noted, annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. Operating margin of 18% was up 8 points from 10% in the prior year period, and year-to-date margin of 14% for the segment is up 4 points.  Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $3 million or 2%. Organic revenue growth was 3% or $4 million, reflecting an increase in U.S. Listings revenues and increases in both IR intelligence revenues and governance solutions revenues. This was partially offset by lower event related revenues at the Nasdaq MarketSite and lower Nasdaq Private Market program activity, both mainly due to the business impact of COVID-19. The operating margin of 39% for the segment was up 3 points from the prior period. Market Services net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $49 million or 22% increase. Excluding the negative $1 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange, the organic revenue increase of $50 million, also 22%. The organic increase driven in the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes. The operating margin of 64% for the segment remains elevated due to the high volume environment.  Turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses were $327 million in the second quarter of 2020, an increase of $5 million or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2019. This reflects a $7 million increase from the impact of acquisitions, as well as higher compensation expense, infrastructure costs and depreciation expense, partially offset by lower corporate travel expenses, event spending and changes in foreign exchange rates.  Turning to Slide 10, we are taking our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance range to $1.33 billion to $1.36 billion. While we've experienced reduced levels of travel and event spending, it is important to note that we plan to continue to invest in the infrastructure necessary to support the current and potential for even greater activity on our platforms. In addition, we're also continuing to allocate the capital and resources to deliver on our longer term growth initiatives and our full year expense guidance range reflects these investments in the second half of the year.  Based on our latest internal expense forecast, which takes into account the impact of the relatively strong organic growth has on variable compensation, as well as the latest foreign exchange rates, as we stand here today, we see ourselves as most likely to be in the top half of our updated expense guidance range. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $71 million in the second quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 53% compared to 48% in the prior year period. The nearly 500 basis point increase in the margin year-over-year reflects strong operating leverage, particularly in Market Services business as well as multi-year efforts to enhance the company's scalability. So, we would expect some near term reversion should market volumes moderate.  Net interest expense was $25 million in the second quarter of 2020, a decrease of $3 million versus the prior year. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.4% for the second quarter of 2020. For full year 2020, we continue to expect the non-GAAP tax rates to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2020 was $256 million, or $1.54 per diluted share compared to $203 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Let me now turn to the balance sheet. As we're taking steps from the first quarter of 2020 to increase cash reserves and eliminate near term maturities, in the second quarter, Nasdaq took advantage of a receptive credit environment and issued a $500 million 30 year bond. Then, as the short-term credit environment continued to improve, we became more comfortable with reducing our cash position to more normal levels and used the proceeds from our debt offering and the excess cash on hand to redeem outstanding commercial paper and to repay all the borrowers on our revolver. As a result, the company returned to lower leverage while enhancing available liquidity.  Turning to slide 11, the net of these actions is that debt decreased by $626 million versus March 31st, primarily due to $1.1 billion of aggregate net payments on revolver borrowings and commercial paper that I mentioned a moment ago. Our total debt-to-EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4 times, down from 3 times in the first quarter of 2020. Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.9 times, down from 2.3 times in the first quarter of 2020. Also, during the second quarter of 2020, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $80 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $30 million. Year-to-date, through June 30th, the company has repurchased common stock in the amount of $152 million, largely completing our objective to use share repurchases to offset dilution of equity compensation and other sources of gross issuances to ensure investors benefit from a stable share count. With that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Well, I think we've covered it to some degree in the remarks, Adena, so obviously, the operating leverage is getting the benefit from the additional revenue that we're receiving on the trading activity and that side of the business. And we continue to, as we said in my remarks, invest in the business. And so we do think that there -- for the full year the overall expense guidance is around that 3% range. So, that's what we're targeting and that's what -- when you look at that, in my remarks we said sort of the mid to the upper end of the range with respect to that expense guidance. That's where we come in around 3% for the full year. And then on the revenue side it's really with respect to what happens with respect to the operating or the revenue activities we have on the trading side, which is what the real driver as to whether it's in a -- stay where it is, increases or decreases, it's dependent somewhat in the short-term based on the trading activity. Yes, I think, it's just a bit of an extension of what Adena was saying with respect to. We look at the expenses in the context of the revenue. And so if we're in a period where this is continuing, and then obviously along with that there's good chance for uncertainty. So we'll be seeing good revenue or activity on the transactional side of the business. So that goes through really the resiliency of the business, but obviously in an environment that we're sitting in, we are seeing the benefit of reduced levels of spending on some of the discretionary spend or things like travel, our marketing events have moved online, and so you save some of the in-person costs and the cost of hosting those events and we have moved those online, but then there are some savings that's related to that. So we obviously always look at our discretionary spend and we'll look at the non-essential initiatives that we're looking at as an organization that you do over the longer term, but we're definitely going to and I want to make sure, we're clear about this in continuation of my remarks that we're continuing to invest in the capacity and the infrastructure to meet the markets' demands. In addition to that, we will continue to invest in the long-term growth initiatives for the business. And so we will look to manage expenses where we can and where possible, but we will continue to invest for the future."

At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Ed Ditmire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2020 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Michael Ptasznik, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on three areas: I will review Nasdaq's start to the year, in particular how we are adapting to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and our results for the first quarter of 2020. I will discuss how we are seeing the potential for our business in 2020 to be impacted by the pandemic and I will discuss the secular trends that have informed our long-term strategy and how we see them developing through and after the current pandemic crisis. I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are all navigating through an unprecedented moment in history as our global community fights the spread of COVID-19 and prepares for what will be a lasting impact on our daily life. I speak for the entire Nasdaq family when I say our thoughts are with those who are battling this virus, the families who have lost loved ones and those who are on the front lines of our economy and our society putting themselves at risk every day to care for us and our well-being. They include the millions of people who work extremely hard to make sure that we have food, power and other necessities. They are the many who are keeping critical stores open and shipping goods to our homes. They are the healthcare workers, who are putting their health and their family's health at risk to care for the sick and handle the heartbreaking loss of life. There are not enough words that can express our deep gratitude to the millions around the world who are enabling us to stay home and stay safe. The crisis has highlighted how the human spirit manifests itself and it has been truly awe-inspiring. To provide immediate assistance to those in our communities who are most at risk, we took action last month and committed $6 million in cash and in-kind donations to the COVID-19 response and relief efforts. In addition Nasdaq employees have been engaged in our philanthropic response including our double matching program which has raised more than $400,000 so far for charitable organizations fighting the pandemic. Turning to the Nasdaq community specifically from the start of the pandemic, we have been committed to the safety and well-being of the Nasdaq team as well as the broader needs of the Nasdaq client community. As COVID-19 spread across the world we moved quickly to transition our global workforce to a remote operating environment through a combination of work from home and split teams for critical on-site employees. At this time 98% of our global team are working from home to support the various country or statewide measures to flatten the curve. For those few staff around the world who are performing critical on-site functions, we're deploying extra precautions to ensure their safety. We remain deeply committed to serving our clients seamlessly while keeping our employees as safe as possible. I am so proud and impressed with the entire Nasdaq team and their commitment to our mission. In fact, our role in the economy in which we serve as a critical market operator has never been in sharper focus as it has been in the past six weeks. Additionally, our clients across the world have turned to us for technology expertise as well as insights and analytics to support their decision-making in this period of extreme challenge. We have invested and prepared for many years to be ready for what has transpired around the globe in the past several weeks. Across our markets in the U.S. and Europe, our teams across technology, operations, legal and client service are collaborating extremely well to provide a high-quality trading experience for our broker-dealer and investor clients during a period of unprecedented volatility and volume. Our market technology team, who provide strategic technology solutions to other exchanges around the world has been supporting our exchange clients with our technology expertise to support their own spikes and trading activity. Across corporate services, we are providing our corporate clients with critical insights regarding the drastic changes in their investor base and what it means for their equity relationships going forward. And in information services we are providing institutional investors with key insights into their funds positioning in relation to their peers and now with the addition of Solovis with deeper insights into their portfolios across private and public assets. These times of stress and uncertainty test us and I'm extremely grateful to the entire Nasdaq team for rising so successfully to the challenge while they also balance their own personal situations throughout this period. Turning next to our financial results. During the first quarter of this year, we set new quarterly highs of $701 million in net revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.50, up 11% and 23% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our market services business rose 21% and our non trading segments grew 7% from the prior year period. On an organic basis revenues in the non-trading segments increased 8% year-over-year. We also continue to make certain investments to advance our business acquiring ESG workflow provider OneReport and investments analytics firm Solovis during the quarter. These initiatives aligned with our disciplined strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider while sustaining our leadership position of our core marketplace franchise. Turning to the specific highlights in the first quarter, I will start first with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $281 million driven by higher cash equity and equity derivatives revenue as the business was able to handle the historic surge in quoting and execution volumes despite having to navigate the many business continuity challenges as the health crisis posed. While I believe in aggregate, the exchange industry, our broker dealer intermediaries and our regulators have responded strongly and successfully to the significant challenges that came with the enormous rampant activity, I'm particularly proud of how Nasdaq's marketplaces were able to fulfill their mission to the investment community, all while we took proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our staff providing critical market functions. Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenue of $128 million in the first quarter, a 6% increase boosted by year-over-year growth in our issuer base, particularly from larger cap issuers and increased demand for our investor relations intelligence and governance offerings. Nasdaq was extremely busy in the earlier portions of the first quarter. Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 27 IPOs, a 69% win rate. We listed six of the top 10 IPOs by dollars raised including PPD Inc. which provides drug and development services to the biopharmaceutical industry, the largest U.S. IPO year to date. Our acquisition of OneReport during the period will broaden our strategic engagement and collaboration with corporate clients who are seeking clarity and efficiency in their ESG reporting. We believe this solution will further strengthen our value with the thousands of clients who already rely on our team for counsel on a range of governance and sustainability related issues through solutions like our ESG advisory service and our board assessment and collaboration technology. Now let me turn to our technology and analytics businesses. In the first quarter, our market technology segment delivered $81 million in revenues and signed $80 million in new order intake. Our annualized recurring revenue in the quarter was $257 million, [indiscernible] increase year-over-year. I'm extremely impressed with how the multitude of exchange and broker-dealer customers of Nasdaq market technology business successfully responded to the challenges of running their franchises in the midst of both market turbulence and the human health crisis. And I'm proud that our resilient marketplace technology was able to support them meaningfully as they did so. Turning to our information services segment. We delivered net revenues of $211 million in the first quarter, up $18 million or 9% year-over-year. I would like to highlight that our index revenue saw double-digit growth as AUM in Nasdaq licensed ETPs rose 5% year-over-year meaningfully outperforming the declines in a broader -- in the broad market indices over the same period and volumes in Nasdaq license equity index futures set new highs in the quarter. The AUM was bolstered by continued inflows into our flagship index products. For instance, despite the sharp declines from the market peak on February 19, through the bottom experienced on March 20 for the Nasdaq 100 over that time the largest ETF globally that tracks in Nasdaq 100 which is the Invesco QQQ ETF, experienced $5.2 billion in net inflows. In fact total ETF industry AUM for the 12-month period ending March 31 was down 0.5% according to research provider ETF GI, while Nasdaq's ETF AUM increased by 5%. We are pleased with the resilience of our index products in a period of record volatility and extreme downward pressure in the broader market. I will also note that for the second quarter, the majority of Information Services revenue came from index licensing and investment analytics products, the result of years of investment into expanding our capabilities in these higher growth areas. Now that we've covered the first quarter results, I would like to talk about the changing industry dynamics we are observing. We are fortunate to have a particularly resilient operating and financial model at Nasdaq. We deliver many essential and increasingly strategic products and services to diverse ecosystem of clients. The balance of a trading franchise that performs best during periods of maximum uncertainty and a larger recurring revenue business across Information Services, Corporate Services and Market Technology delivers relative stability in aggregate over a wide range of macroeconomic environments. Focusing on our volume driven businesses, as we look forward to the remainder of the year it is very difficult to project the volume environment. We are currently focused on the following signals. First is the continued volume strength in April with $12.7 billion in average daily share volume in U.S. equities, which is a 92% increase over last April and nearly $25 million \u2013 I mean sorry $25 million in average daily contract volume in U.S. equity options, a 51% increase over the last April. Second is a myriad of economic unknowns that the COVID-19 virus carries with it as it continues its global spread. And third is the upcoming U.S. election which when coupled with the virus for providing ingredients for continued elevated volumes for our markets in the months ahead. The flipside impact of the volatility and economic uncertainty however is the effect on IPOs. In our Corporate Services franchise, we entered 2020 with incredibly strong momentum maintaining our U.S. listings leadership through what had been a very busy period for IPOs. In addition, we steadily grew the issuer base in Nasdaq's Nordic markets and in our Corporate Solutions sub-segment after many years of investing, restructuring and reposition, we saw growth reemerge. All of these factors will continue to benefit us. However, we are beginning to see the impacts of the pandemic influence corporate issuer behavior in the near term. While a number of corporate clients are turning to our IR intelligence team for short term mandates to understand the underlying activities in their stock and demand for our ESG advisory offering continues to have momentum, the vast majority of IPO candidates are waiting to see if market conditions stabilize. We are also seeing some companies delaying corporate solutions purchasing decisions and in some cases looking to reduce near-term discretionary spend. In our Market Technology business we're extremely fortunate to have a large diverse and well-established customer base across market infrastructure operators and banks and brokers with long term locked in contracts as the underpinning of the business. Therefore, our revenue base is very solid and we had a successful year in 2019 and signing up new clients and renewing some of our key existing clients. However, our early observations of the impact of the virus in 2020 makes us more cautious about our short-term growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Specifically, our clients are dealing with the twin challenges of a surge in trading volumes and the logistical challenges of the health crisis with their staff working remotely. As a result we're seeing clients take longer to make upgrades and new purchasing decisions. They are also extending implementation schedules and instituting temporary code freezes that will delay the timing of short-term change requests. Additionally, we continue to have great engagement prospects in our new market initiatives and we believe that our sales pipeline remains strong. However, we expect the purchase and market launch decisions will likely come under additional scrutiny and review while these prospects observe the economic impacts of the virus. In our Information Services business, the dynamics of the environment bring varied implications for each of the sub segments. At investment, we have not yet felt substantial impact from the pandemic and remain focused on expanding our capabilities in client and markets, but we could see short-term results impacted by some of the following COVID-19 related factors. On the positive side, when asset owners see more alpha opportunity in more volatile markets and become more interested in active and/or alternative asset management investments evaluation data and analytics become especially important. We also believe asset owners are more likely to demand the real time portfolio analytics delivered by Solovis and those that have them are more likely to respond by adjusting their allocations. On the risks to our near-term revenue growth, while we have not yet experienced a measurable change our clients behaviors, we will be watching to see if the pandemic leads to heightened client attrition through closures of small asset managers or consolidation, as well as the potential for moderated spend per client or delayed purchasing decisions by new client prospects. Our index franchisee so far is demonstrating strong resilience is bolstered by continued elevated volumes in the futures products. However, it's hard to predict, how the market performance of index products will develop as the economic impact of the virus continues to evolve. We're very pleased to see that the investment inflows mute the downward pressure on the AUM from the drop-end market values, which we also experienced in Q4, 2018 when the market had a different valuation dislocation. However, it is always difficult to predict future investor behavior. Our market data business has demonstrated resilience across prior recessionary periods but it is not completely immune when economic downturns are more protracted. Additionally, in recent years we have successfully diversified our clients outside our traditional U.S. markets but there could be some pullback from these clients if they view real-time data to be discretionary in a time of economic pressure as this period may represent. As you know, we do not issue short-term current year revenue growth guidance at Nasdaq. Our trading businesses are subject to significant external factors such as volatility and therefore we do not provide any revenue outlook for our market services segment. For our non-trading businesses with recurring revenues as their foundation, we have issued ranges describing where we expect organic growth in these segments to average over perspective rolling three to five year period, which we consider medium term. Since early 2018, we have targeted an organic compound annual revenue growth rate across these non-trading segments collectively of 5% to 7% over that medium term 3 to 5 years period. We also said that over short term -- shorter periods of time, we expect there to be data points above and below our communicated range, especially during the most impactful peaks and troughs of the economic cycle. Over each of the past two years, we have delivered organic growth from the non-trading segments at or above the top of that 5% to 7% medium-term outlook range and we continue to believe that same range is appropriate outlook looking forward over the next 3 to 5 year period. However, in the short term taking into considerations all of the dynamics that I've just described across our businesses, while we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our business overall we see increasing risks to reaching the lower end of that 5% to 7% range collectively across our non-trading segments for the full year of 2020. We will continue to provide updates in our growth progress for 2020 in upcoming quarterly calls, as we gain more knowledge and experience in the current environment. Overall, we are proud of the resilient and diversified nature of our business with a coupling of volume driven revenue and more stable recurring revenues serving as our foundation. With our diversity we benefit from certain segments bolstering our results when others face some short-term pressures. That has been the story of Nasdaq for many years now. And overall, it provides for more stability and predictability than many of our direct peers. As a result, while we remain a performance culture where individual employment decisions are still made on the basis of each of their efforts and contributions, we have made a commitment to our employees that we will not initiate any broad-based layoffs this year. We are proud to support our employees and help them feel secure in their professional lives, while they address the challenges of COVID-19 and its implications that they have on the personal and family situations. While we actively address the particular challenges of the pandemic and related economic impacts in the near term, we're also paying close attention to what the changing world tells us about the most important long-term secular dynamics in our industry, the changes that are most impacting our clients and where we have the largest opportunities to grow as we deliver against the opportunities they create. What we are seeing overwhelmingly is that the pandemic is in many ways reinforcing these longer-term dynamics. For example, we recognized during our strategic review in 2017 that the investment management industry is going through profound change including an enlarging passive investing trend on one end of the spectrum, a private market on the other end of the spectrum and an increasingly pressured traditional active management industry in the middle. During the pandemic induced downturn, we're seeing continued positive flows into ETF despite the market pullback, while private equity firms are raising new capital that might be put to work in particularly distressed industries. Among our traditional asset management clients, it's an increasingly competitive world with certain firms outperforming the market and drawing a new capital while others face significant outflows. We believe that how we partner with asset managers to launch new innovative ETFs that help them participate in the passive trends, how we assist private companies and private equity funds with the liquidity events through the private market and how we help active managers and private equity funds compete for flows with the investment will continue to be increasingly important. In market technology, with our next-generation trade lifecycle technology platform, we see the benefits of marketplace and surveillance solutions leveraging the cloud to be scalable to any level of activity and accessible by both users and operators from anywhere in the world. We view that to be even more critical in a world that likely considers a much wider spectrum of business continuity scenarios than it ever has before. And with our corporate issuers who are faced with increasing challenges that they have to meet to effectively navigate public ownership, we believe that the need for technology enabled and highly specialized consultative partner to assist with activities such as managing buy side interaction and governance and sustainability matters will be even more essential. Over the past three years, we have set a course for transformation of our business without sacrificing the quality of service we provide to our clients and while remaining focused on value creation for our stakeholders. The results we have delivered is a rewarding indication that this strategy is working. Yet we recognize that to maintain our momentum against a business backdrop that is still digesting the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic we must continue to challenge ourselves each and every day. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying our communities are adapting to the challenges of isolation and the uncertainty of what lies ahead. These times of stress and uncertainty test us and I am proud of what we have delivered for our clients and stakeholders this past quarter. We are looking out for each other and we are continuing to get the job done for those who rely on us. We are also incredibly grateful for and inspired by the collective compassion that has surfaced as a result of this crisis particularly demonstrated by frontline healthcare and other essential workers. Moving forward in 2020, we remain focused on advancing our strategic mission. As our teams have adjusted to the remote nature of daily life, I'm reminded by one of Nasdaq's founding principles that people do not need to be in the same physical place to be part of the same community. This founding principle continues to drive us as we face the unexpected and I believe we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction this year. And with that I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details.\nMichael Ptasznik: Thank You Adena. Good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages 4 and 14. The $67 million increase in reported net revenue of $701 million is the net result for organic growth of $81 million including a 22% organic increase in market services and an 8% organic growth in the non-trading segments. An $8 million net negative impacts from acquisitions and divestitures and a $6 million unfavorable impacts from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Information Services revenues which as reflected on pages 5 and 14 increased $18 million or 9%. Organic revenue growth during the period was also 9% reflecting growth in the index and investment data and analytics businesses. Included in index revenues is a $5 million collection of previously unpaid license usage fees. Market Technology revenue as shown on pages 6 and 14 increased $4 million or 5% with organic growth of $5 million or 6%. The organic increase was partially offset by a negative $2 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in software-as-a-service surveillance revenues and an increase in software delivery and support projects. As Adena mentioned annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. This increase was the net of an adverse impact from changes in foreign exchange rates which also affected the comparison to the preceding fourth quarter of 2019. Without that impact the year-over-year growth in ARR was 11%. Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $7 million or 6%. Organic revenue growth was also 6% or $7 million reflecting an increase in the total number of listed companies and annual renewal fees as well as higher governance solutions revenues and IR intelligence revenues. Market Services net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $48 million or 21% increase. Excluding the negative $3 million impact from unfavorable changes in Foreign Exchange the organic revenue increases was $51 million or 22%. Organic increase during the period primarily reflects an increase in cash equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to the higher industry trading volumes. Now turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $14 million to $336 million. The change reflects a $23 million or 7% organic increase, most of which was due to the impact of higher achievement within our performance-based compensation programs in relation to the higher organic growth. This is partially offset by $5 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a $4 million payroll impacts from changes in foreign exchange rates. Turning to slide 10. We are updating our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Adjusting largely for foreign exchange rates and the recent acquisitions of Solovis and OneReport, the midpoint of the expense range represents an approximate 3% organic increase year-over-year. This 3% organic increase is consistent with our medium-term 3% expectation and is unchanged from the three months ago when we reported fourth quarter results. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $53 million in the first quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 52% compared with 49% in the prior year period. The 300 basis point increase in the margin year-over-year reflects a strong operating leverage particularly in our Market Services business as well as multi-year efforts to enhance the company\u2019s scalability. Though we would expect some near-term reversion should market volumes moderate. Net interest expense was $24 million in the first quarter 2020, a decrease of $10 million primarily due to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2019. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.5% for the first quarter of 2020, for full year 2020 we expect a non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2020 was $251 million or $1.50 per diluted share compared to $204 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of Section 31 fees, which is a pass-through fees collected on behalf of the SEC, free cash flow in the first quarter of 2020 was $380 million. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet, where we've taken actions to strengthen our liquidity and cash position and address refinancing risks in response to the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 and related economic impacts. First, in February we took advantage of relatively low rates in the Euro bond market to refinance the $600 million 2021 Euro bond with a new 10 year, $600 million 2030 Euro bond, reducing our borrowing costs from 3.875% to 0.875% annually. This also eliminated near-term bond maturities until May of 2023. Then starting in March, we observe conditions in the market for tier 2 commercial paper issuers were deteriorated impacting both costs and actionable duration of CP issues. And so we borrowed under a revolving credit line to eliminate funding uncertainties. Among Nasdaq funding sources are revolver serves the principal purpose to provide liquidity and act as a backstop on our commercial paper program, so that if we encountered a time when issuing commercial paper was unavailable or unattractive, we would have the option of borrowing on a revolving credit line instead. We typically maintained around $400 million to $500 million in commercial paper and given the uncertainty in the debt market during March we decided to borrow approximately $800 million of our available liquidity on the revolver. The approximate $800 million provided the company the ability to repair commercial paper including the remaining $350 million as it comes due over the balance of Q2 plus create an additional cash cushion of approximately $300 million. Looking forward we expect to maintain this more conservative cash position in the near term and as always, we weigh funding alternatives which include utilizing our borrowings under the revolver, returning to the commercial paper markets if conditions are attractive or issuing long-term debt. Now turning to slide 11. The net of these actions is that at the end of Q1, 2020 debt increased by $721 million versus Q4 of 2019 primarily due to the net borrowing of approximately $800 million on revolver. This is partially offset by a net reduction in other debt instruments. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.0 times up 0.4 times versus the fourth quarter of 2019 but our net debt to EBITDA was 2.3 times unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2019. While adjusting our balance sheet positioning to enhance our liquidity brings slightly higher interest expense it has enabled us to have uninterrupted ability to continue executing our capital deployment plan. For example, during the first quarter of 2020 the company funded the two aforementioned tuck-in acquisitions Solovis and OneReport as well as continued funding of our important R&D initiatives such as our work to expand investment solutions set to serve private equity investors and the continued rollout of our SaaS market technology model. Also during the first quarter of 2020, the company paid a common dividend in the aggregate of $78 million and repurchase common stock in the amount of $122 million. With an additional $30 million of repurchases completed thus far in Q2, we have largely offset the dilution from our equity programs for 2020. Today the company also announced that our board has approved a 4% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.49 per share which takes into account our growth in income and cash flow over the last year but also the heightened uncertainties around the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic's future macroeconomic impacts. Looking forward, we plan to continue with our stated capital deployment priorities, of working to identify investment opportunities that meet our strategic and financial objectives, of maintaining our dividend policy with the intention to provide stockholders with regular and growing dividends over the long term as earnings and cash flow grow, of executing our buyback program to target a stable share count and to manage balance sheet leverage to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. With that I thank you for your time and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRichard Repetto: Good morning Adena and good morning Michael and Adena thanks for the review of the business segments and I guess the sensitivities to this, I guess changing and challenging environment. The one \u2013 and it helped very much. One question I'm getting from investors and sort of jumped out at me too was the new order intake in market technology. So it came down from the elevated levels for my 4Q but the ARR didn't materially change quarter-over-quarter. So I'm just trying to see that big number that you put up in 4Q. Could you review again how that could flow through and how you could see benefits in the market tech segment?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Thanks Rich. So we did have a high level of order intake in the fourth quarter and that obviously then had some impact on the amount of order intake we took in on the first quarter but as a reminder the order intake can come in three different groups. So one is renewing and in some cases expanding existing clients, the contracts so that's both extending out of the contract term and in some cases expanding the services they offer. The second is new client acquisitions for trading solutions and what I will call marketplace solutions and the third is the more staffs oriented revenue that's more immediately SaaS in our surveillance business and what you're finding is the order intake that took place in Q4 the way that it flows through ARR is in the SaaS, is kind of surveillance business that's currently SaaS and any new markets that are truly SaaS that can come in pretty quickly into the ARR in the following quarter but the vast majority of the order intake either is an expanding out of contracts so that it will then start to flow into ARR as our contracts are extended or with new clients where we have to develop the solution and then deploy it, the ARR will not -- it won't show up on ARR until we've deployed the solution because we don't count the billed on costs and the billed revenue oriented revenue as ARR. So in the vast majority of the cases for the fourth-quarter order intake it is requiring us to build out the solutions first before that'll show up in ARR so there is a delay.\nRichard Repetto: Got it, thank you very much and again thanks for the review of the business segments.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks a lot Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks and just a question again on market tech, thinking about some of the forward-looking implications you highlighted. The 1Q results were slightly below, we were looking for, so curious if you started to already see that play out in margin in the 1Q revenues? Are there other things that may be impacted that kind of potential first quarter results in terms of the slowdown and then also last quarter you mentioned margins improving on a year-over-year basis and that segment going forward given the forward look for revenues, I assume that's maybe not a doable but maybe talk about the margin profile for that segment given the changes you've been implementing for a while and the transition to SaaS and those things and how that might still play out from a margin perspective?\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. Thanks. So with regard to the 1Q results and looking at how they are developing as we go through the year, I think that we -- I would say that we didn't see a lot of impact of the COVID-19 situation on our 1Q results but some because remember a lot of our clients are in Asia and so they were earlier, hit much earlier by the virus than the rest of the world and so some of the works that we were doing in that region got delayed. So I would say that there was some impact in Q1. I think that now that it's become more of a global situation, we wanted to make sure we did give you a view into what we are seeing so that you can understand were there might be delays in work that we're working on. We are still for instance doing design studies but if they're doing, if we're doing design study remotely it just takes longer to get the design studies done. And so and we are still doing them. It's actually been really great to work with our clients that way but it does take longer to get through the design work when you're having to log in on Zoom together. And then in terms of some of the new enhancements that we are working on for our clients or frankly upgrades of their trading systems or other systems. They've asked for some short-term delays while they're managing through a remote working environment and so those are the types of things that we're starting to see. We're not seeing general underlying weakness in our clients or client relationships. It's really just showing that there are other diversions of their attention right now and that will have some short-term impact on how we can recognize revenue against project related work, a short-term change requests as well as new deliveries that we're working on. In terms of the margin we are as focus as you guys are on managing the margin in the business and so the way that we're looking at that balance is we wanted to be able to continue to develop and deploy our next gen technology stack and there's work that we're doing to really fill out our SaaS capabilities against that technology and we will, our goal is to continue to do that work. We also have to make sure we're managing to our client expectations in terms of managing workload we do have but we also have the ability to look at that in terms of making sure that we're making the right decisions around building out the teams and managing the teams so that we can try to manage to the shorter term margin issues. So we are still working towards showing an expansion of margin there but as you said it will be harder with lower growth this year.\nDan Fannon: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Thanks very much for your comments also Adena. Very helpful course of businesses. Maybe just to circle back on that in terms of that sounds like it's mostly from within the market tech segment in terms of the COVID-19 related slowdown but maybe if you can just sort of characterize what you think, the base revenue run rate is on a quarterly basis that would be -- that is guaranteed effectively through this period and then also if you can just comment on the index data that looked like it was very strong related in relation to the actual metrics. So just wondering how that the index data might play out in the second quarter given where the markets have been had turned?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So we don't communicate kind of that base revenue that you're looking for. We try to provide enough context for you to understand that we have a very broad and secure base of clients both across all of our businesses. So whether it's market technology, corporate solutions, information services and our markets business. We have active and engaged conversations and we have a very broad base of clients. So we have that the benefit of diversity and when I gave my comments I wanted you to see either what we're starting to see or what we could see as we understand this pandemic and its potential impact on our clients. But we don't provide a specific kind of revenue base number that you're looking for. We're just trying to make sure you understand how our growth could be impacted going forward through the year. In terms of our index business, the index business was impacted by three things. First, as Michael mentioned we did have a collection of unpaid invoices that we were able to secure in the quarter and that had a positive impact of $5 million but even without that we did have double-digit growth in the index business and that was driven by the fact that our AUM is up. So that's one. And that volumes in the futures of business as you know we have an agreement with CME on the futures volumes in the Nasdaq-100 index futures and those volumes were very, very high during the quarter which obviously helped supplement the growth in the business.\nBrian Bedell: Got it. That makes sense. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, thanks. Sorry to jump back into the index business real quick but can you actually be a little bit more specific and maybe this is for Michael then, on the pieces on the quarter-to-quarter basis because I feel like there's still something missing. So AUM, I think average AUM was up 5% quarter-over-quarter in ETPs and I think the volumes you mentioned on CME I think we're up 109% quarter-over-quarter. So maybe just in terms of dollars what the contributions were and also maybe on the subscription side if there was a big increase there? It just seems like there's, you're either doing a lot better than we thought or something else going on. So just curious if you can flesh out the pieces looks better.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So I think that a couple things and I'll also send it over to Michael to see if I miss anything. So the first thing is recognizing that the AUM is 5% growth in AUM but then also depends on where the AUM is coming from and in this particular case we saw strong, pretty strong reflection of AUM in our benchmark indices that tend to carry a slightly higher fee rate. So that's one to consider and then the second thing is on the futures volumes when I looked at last year, I looked at like all of last year and the future is volume revenue contributed about 12% of the overall revenue -- 12.5% of the overall revenue in the index business whereas in the first quarter it was 19%. So hopefully that will give you a sense of the scale of the change in the futures revenue but I don't know Michael if you have anything else.\nMichael Ptasznik: No, I think it's primarily within that futures revenue is -- we do have a new contract with CME and so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, any additional volumes, plus e-mini micros that they have when you take that all into account with the mix, etc. It adds up in the results that we're seeing plus in addition to $5 million Adena mentioned earlier and that I mentioned in my remarks.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Thanks. Those numbers from Adena were great. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nChris Allen: Yes. Morning everyone. I guess, I just want to ask quickly just on the taking down the revolver and maintaining the cash buffer. I get that you have to repay the CP in the second quarter, if the CP markets do not improve. I'm just wondering why you think it\u2019s necessary to maintain a notable cash buffer right now, just given the cash generation capabilities of your businesses and just where you are from a kind of leverage standpoint at present.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes. Thanks Chris. I think the simple answer is it's really built in suspenders as we're going through an unprecedented time something that comes along once every hundred years and you're in a situation when we were in March with the markets were very volatile. The short term funding markets obviously had have tightened up substantially and honestly in a position like this it's just a matter of having liquidity is a very good thing to have and it just allows us to sleep well at night. So there was no immediate need for that additional buffer. It honestly was just putting some additional cash on the balance sheet so that we had some protection for unforeseen circumstances again given just the uncertainty around the events. And as things settle down and things now with the government stimulus and the markets returning to normal we will take a look to see whether we need to maintain that additional $300 million or so and will pay down the revolver when we feel comfortable but it was really just like I said it built-in suspenders approach.\nChris Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Good morning and thanks for your update and taking the questions. Questions around the organic growth and I think for all the updates I think that was helpful and would be cautious this year but when you think about the low end of the range like in terms of determining that is it like kind of the depth of the recession and the impact from the pandemic or is it more the duration meaning if it lasts a long time? And then Michael just on the expenses related to the non-transaction and the non-trading part of the business, like how flexible is that and Adena, I think you mentioned on the organic growth like the longer term but like you go through like if you like this and a lot of customers kind of rethink businesses. So are there any parts of the business that you think you can actually see more demand for outsourcing and some of the services that you provide to your customers?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks a lot. So I'll start with the organic growth range. I think that we've been really evaluating 2020 and we also have been looking at it long term as I mentioned, so it's kind of like what's the immediate impact and how should we make sure that we're communicating at least what we're seeing and what we know about a great unknown right now. And then also looking longer-term, are we still playing into the right trends. Are we seeing those trends either develop as they have been or even accelerate. So taking both in order on 2020 I think that, we are trying to make sure that we recognize that if things kind of are able to return to a \u201cnew normal\u201d I'm going to call it that relatively in a sustainable way as we get through the first half of this year and into the second half of the year then I think that will find that IPO has come back in albeit slower than what we had experienced last year in the first quarter. We will also expect that we will continue to have great ability to provide intelligence solutions to our investment management clients and our corporate clients and then we also have a lot of projects and a lot of opportunities within market tech that we would expect that our clients will want to hop right back to it and get those going as they see their own worlds normalized to a degree. We do think there will be a new normal though. We don't expect all of our employees to come back to the office right away. We don't expect our clients employees to come back to the office right away and so it will be a hopefully a steady improvement in the environment as we get better testing as we hopefully implement some contact tracing and we can be better at managing and equipping our employees to work safely. So I think Mike that's a new normal that's something that we would like to see and I think that gives us -- that make \u2013 it plays right into what we're good at and what we can do but we also recognize that that's not necessarily the outcome. So we wanted to give you a sense of where are there the risks and those risks to the extent they continue to manifest will make it harder for us to reach the low end of the range this year and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of that, but when we look longer term we continue to be really optimistic about where we're investing and why what we're doing is important and I actually completely agree with your comment which is that as people look forward and they say okay what do I need to do myself and where can I find a partner who can do it for me or what do I need to do on-site and what can I put into a cloud environment to make it some not as dependent on my data center and the people there. I think that we have a lot of opportunity to partner with our clients on tech. I mean I really do. I think that they will be looking for more and more solutions that can scale up, that can be operated remotely, managed remotely, that make it so that they can operate in a more of a BCP environment and I believe that what we're building and what we're doing will play into that quite nicely. In terms of the expenses I'm going to send that over to Michael because I forgot what the question was.\nMichael Ptasznik: Yes. Thank Adena. The answer on the expenses and whether it's a trading or the non-trading expenses. I think Nasdaq has historically shown that it's very efficiency focused organization and we do look at our expenses on a very detailed basis across our different segments and depending on what's happening with respect to the nature of the business we do have some levers that we can affect. We obviously have some discretionary spend across our different programs. Number one we'll take a look at those and that includes things like marketing and travel and entertainment and other types of opportunities. In addition to that we do have our initiatives and there's \u2013 these initiatives that Adena referred to earlier in our R&D program but there's also a number of other underlying initiatives that as an organization you have the opportunity to either do faster or slow down depending on the nature of the environment that we're facing and then you can always continue to look at other elements within the cost space. We now have much more flexibility with respect to our working environment and so we'll take those things into account. So I think will be very cost-conscious and we will obviously observe the environment and adjust our expenses accordingly.\nMike Carrier: Thanks a lot.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Ghosh: Hey good morning everyone. Assuming this one for Adena, I appreciate all the color that you provided and apologies again but back to your comments around potential risk of hitting that 5% range in 2020. Just based on your early assessment and I know you've hit on this a little bit but again apologies if I missed it. Could you just talk about specific areas and segments that might be driving that? Because if I think about the trends that you saw early this quarter, info services, the solid friends there and then just overall in the business by those analytics surveillance, tech infrastructure those are sort of more essential and I imagine would be a little more sticky in the near term as well. So maybe can you just drill down by maybe high-level business and then specific either client segments or regions that you see right now that could potentially drive some of this weakness in the near term that could just help maybe sort of bring fences and brands for us to think about sort of how long this could last in terms of whether it's more near-term concern with the particular sub-client segment or maybe longer term nature? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Okay. So I'll try to be brief but it's a big question. So the first thing I would say is you are correct that we have a sticky client base and I think that we should recognize that and I hopefully I conveyed that in my prepared remarks that we have, we do provide critical services, critical technologies, critical information that allow our clients to navigate the capital markets or operate capital markets successfully. So you are very correct we have a sticky client base and so that gives us great confidence in the overall base and foundation of our business. But when we look at growth it's driven by obviously in upgrading or even increasing the relationships we have a certain customers or finding new customers or making changes in pricing. And I think we've made our normal course changes in prices this year and those are already being reflected and through the results but when we look at the other two, I think that when it comes to our current client base whether it's corporate clients, investment management clients, broker-dealer clients or exchanges they're very busy right now. So they will look for us, to us for immediate needs and we will be able to provide them to them like we help them through the surge and traffic and volumes through their systems. We've helped corporate clients really try to understand and do some new targeting work to help them understand how to attract new investors into their names. We certainly have done a lot of work with our investment management clients and we're doing a lot of analysis now on, business continuity planning and other things that help our investment management clients. So we have a lot of really interesting short-term work and I think some of that was well reflected in the quarter but also will continue to benefit us. I think where we just want to make sure we recognize is that with our existing clients they are quite-quite busy and so decisions get slowed down and they are also dealing with their own uncertainties and so they want to make sure they kind of understand where the world might sit certainly before they make big decisions but also even with some of the smaller ones it just takes longer to get things through the process. I think that the other thing is with new customers we've had, we have a very good pipeline frankly and we continue to have a good pipeline across our business but those clients also are thinking through their own kind of how quickly can they get it to market, how quickly can they get their new customers to test the system for instance, how quickly do they want to switch over to a new service when everyone's working from home. So to me those are delays in decisions but generally speaking in our recurring revenue segments we do find that we have strong base but we have some clients who are either liking their decisions or deferring them and then or they might they haven't yet but they might so we want to make sure that you're aware of that. And then I would say that in certain places and I did mention this in my comments where we have particularly in corporate clients where we have a range of clients across multiple segments they are going through different phases as some of the segments are quite secure like healthcare and technology and other segments are managing through significant disruptions and can make different decisions around any sort of what they would consider discretionary spend. Again we haven't seen a lot of that yet but that's a risk that we recognize in our business particularly if this situation continues over a longer period of time. So that's all within our non-trading businesses that I mentioned. Within our trading businesses as I mentioned also we don't try to predict volume. We try to long ago but we don't. It's not an easy thing to predict. So we try to make sure we maintain our business and manage our business through cycles and we benefit our shareholders when we have a cycle of high volumes but we definitely try to make sure that we don't take it, we don't commit ourselves to thinking that there's going to be a high volume environment forever. We just are looking at the signals that we're seeing right now and seeing a healthy volume environment right now. So that was what I was basically trying to convey to you. I hope that helped.\nAri Ghosh: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ken Hill with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\nKen Hill: Great. Yes. Thanks and good morning everyone. I wanted to ask yesterday you guys announced the launch of Nasdaq cloud data services. I was hoping you provide a little bit more detail on kind of what the enhanced flexibility does there? I mean obviously it seems like it allows you to kind of update the product more often, have a more tailored data set but is there anything tangible we should be thinking about from maybe an expense footprint perspective or the ability on the revenue side maybe that's happened to new customers or new clients who might not use the legacy products in the past. So just kind of wondering how to think about that candidly? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: So you nailed it. So we are looking at that cloud data service first of all it's not for the ultra-low latency clients but it is for the broader investor base out there in the world and for clients who tailor to investors around the world and because it's delivered in a millisecond environment. So it is truly real-time and that's pretty exciting to be able to deliver that out through a cloud infrastructure and that's some engineering work we did with our cloud partner. The second thing is that it's a really light touch in terms of what the client needs to do to take it. It's a very easy API for them to ingest and to build out front-end capabilities against. So it's got this, it's a very modern language. It's very simple and it makes it so that they can ingest it and develop front-ends very quickly against it. So it's like a light, think of it as like a light development kit that allows them to take in the data a lot faster and have a lot less cost associated with managing the data and recognizing that since it is in a cloud infrastructure they're not having to take the data into and ingest it into their data centers. They can just ping it through and it'll flow through into their systems from the cloud and they can store it and they can manage it in the cloud. So our view is that it's a much lighter infrastructure as well and I would say that we are expecting to be able to see new customers. That's kind of one of the main reasons for doing it is to continue to expand our client base but we also are working with customers that we've had who might take it as a new feed like maybe they took our basic feed before and now they want to take our depth because it's a lot easier to take in. so for all those reasons we're excited but it's new. So we just launched it yesterday and we have a lot of work to do to make sure we build up that pipeline and make it a reality for us.\nKen Hill: Okay. Great. Thanks for the detail there.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a question from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: How does COVID-19 change how you guys are thinking about acquisitions, you want to potentially be a bit more opportunistic because I presume evaluations have come down or you want to be more cautious because we just don't know what the revenue outlook is going to look like?\nAdena Friedman: A great question. So the first thing I would say is, I think it's a little early for companies to necessarily admit to themselves that their valuations have come down. So while I do think we are in, we have our resilient business, we have a strong cash orientation to our business, we have a lot of opportunities to grow and continue to manage our growth organically in the context of what I've been discussing this morning. And so we were there to be a really great opportunity out there that we really think is a great strategic fit and delivers a really good financial result and we have line of sight into the future of that business because that's the big thing that everyone's trying to grapple with. Then we may choose to continue to take that opportunistic approach but I think that will be more cautious in a couple areas. One is certainly making sure we're thinking about in the context of our own balance sheet and making sure we continue to have a very strong position there. And two is we really need to be able to model it successfully. And so these businesses they have to be able to see through the cycle and know it's on the other end and know that they're also growing into or managing into a trend that we believe in and so for that reason I think you're going to find that it's, I would say we're being more cautious but it certainly is something that we have, we will continue to evaluate. I think as we've said before the vast majority of our time and attention is focused on organic growth. We have the engines going and well some of them may have a little bit of a slower roll this year. I think we still feel highly excited about everything that we have going on organically. So we don't spend every minute thinking about that question but that is something that we'll consider if the opportunity is right.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just on the investment data business, the slowdown in organic growth there to 5% year-over-year, just wondering if you could comment on what that was related to specifically was that, with any type of early impact or should we be expecting some down from that growth rate? And then also just regarding that investment data business it was good to hear that you haven't seen much change in client behavior yet and you kind of won over the stickiness across a number of your non-transaction businesses but there specifically related to eVestment market [indiscernible] mission critical that really interesting other [indiscernible] into 2021.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. I think I quite catch the end of that question. You mind, I just I heard -- I heard you want to talk about eVestment but I didn't quite catch the whole question. Do you mind asking it again?\nKyle Voigt: Yes. Sorry. Just wondering --\nAdena Friedman: Okay. How about this. I'll answer your first question and then okay. I'll try to give you just color into eVestment. So in terms of the growth rate investment data and analytics it's comprised of a few things. So we've got eVestment which is definitely the largest revenue driver there. We also have Quandl and the Nasdaq Fund Network included in there. So just want to make sure everyone knows that it's not just eVestment but when we look at the growth rate of eVestment what we chose to do going into 2020 and coming through 2019 is actually try to focus on deepening our relationships with our clients which frankly is -- I think paying dividends right now. So we actually made a change in the way that we price eVestment to remove the per user charge and make it more of an enterprise charge per client, which has made it so that we've actually significantly increased usage of eVestment within the clients, but it also means that we don't have as many kind of smaller increases in per user revenues that would come in in any given period. But it does also mean that it gives us more of an opportunity to a scale eVestment across the clients, create even more stickiness with our customers and really work with them on developing and delivering new capabilities as this technology and the data it's more propagated within our customers meaning it's not just in the marketing group it's in the senior management office. It's in the fund management office now and so it gives us more of a chance to grow through new capabilities and so on the back of that that did moderate some of the growth that the near-term growth that we saw in the revenues this quarter but it also gives us a lot of stickiness and a great foundation for us to continue to grow and then I think that in general we are doing a lot of investing in eVestment in the private market space. So we've built out a really eight capability to be able to do the same thing for private investors as we can do for public market investors and that has been an area of growth but that I think will start to show up as we get through 2020 and into 2021. And so those areas, I think those are all the things that I think will drive us and continue to have very sticky and success relationships with our customers expand into private markets, continue the global expansion of the business but it did result in some slightly slower growth as we've transitioned our clients to a new pricing scheme.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks for the color. Sorry for the connectivity issues.\nAdena Friedman: That's okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So back to the outlook for non-transaction business growth. Just slower growth dynamics in current environment obviously make a lot of sense but I was hoping you could talk a little bit about areas where we could see actual costs rationalization from some of your clients? So I think you talked about corporate solutions as one of the areas and early responses you just talked about investments but any others that we need to be mindful of is obviously clients potentially might have to respond to their own revenue challenges and if you get hit on the kind of typical contract structure for those relationships are these annual renewals, could there be more near-term terminations just to kind of help us think about the path over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So if I take it by group, so in Corporate Services business as I mentioned to the extent that some of our corporate clients are facing more near term expense challenges they may come to us and try to work with us to change some of the fees that we charge or they may have to make a decision not to take our service but those are -- I mean we have a thousands of customers who take our services. So it's still not going to be a large swath of our client base and in those cases what we have been able to do to the few that we've been working with so far is really just focusing on what are the services they really need and so we've actually been able to retune the conversation towards. So let's actually work on something that's needs more immediate needs and then we'll get back to let's say a perception study later. So they maintain their relationship with us we do a different kind of work for them and that's more relevant to the time that they're dealing with but keeps them as a customer and that's been highly successful so far. But those contracts are anywhere from one to three years generally and they generally roll, auto roll, but it does give them an opportunity to have a conversation with us every one or two or three years. In terms of the data and index business, well as you know index is a little different. So I'm going to put them to the side when it comes to our investment data analytics and some of the groups there in our data business are they, they tend to be either one-year or multi-year contracts with an eVestment but our data business is just you take it, you pay a monthly fee. So we don't tend to contractually obligated our clients over periods of time there and that's worked quite well for us frankly and it is a highly resilient business across cycles and we've been very pleased that our clients actually are coming to us and saying well how can I use your data to save money. So I'm just letting you know, we have had various good conversations with clients who are looking to take some of the proprietary data and maybe consolidate it to make it so they can actually save money against some of the other data providers that they might have. This new cloud service also gives them the flexibility to take the data directly from us as opposed to through a vendor which then also adds a layer of cost. So there are ways that we can work with them on that but we have not as I mentioned other than some of the new clients, particularly outside of the United States that have taken our data to the extent they see it as a discretionary spend they may choose not [indiscernible] later but generally, we have a very resilient business there. In terms of market tech, as you all know those contracts are longer term in nature. Surveillance agreement can be anywhere from three to five years, a market tech a transaction or an execution system or a trade life cycle system contract can be anywhere from 5 to 10 years. So they're very secured contracts. Our exchange clients are looking a lot like us. They're very resilient businesses. They're very stable businesses and so our conversations with them have been more around how can we support them through the short term, how can we make sure that we continue to work with them on upgrading and enhancing their technologies for the long term and so those conversations have remained very-very productive. So I hope that helps.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Yes. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And we have a question from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question related to the Skytra trading venue and then more broadly how does the conversation change with other non-financial industries which may see the need to hedge revenue risk. So for Skytra it may be a little bit hard to gauge but how effective the Skytra exchange could have spread the risk from the travel industry to capital markets and then more broadly do you have more discussions about developing similar trading venue with other non-financial industries to hedge revenue risk? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you. So I don't have any special knowledge of Skytra beyond the work that we're doing with them to develop their trading and clearing solutions. I think that they've actually made statements around that. So I would -- I can work with that to see if that's something that we can get more clarity on from them. I think that they are excited about being able to launch this and they want to be able to provide that hedging capability and I think that they continue to target this year for their launch. So I would say that they continue to see this as being highly relevant but I think that they would have to answer your specific question there. In terms of the broader new markets landscape it definitely has opened our minds to working with clients on that kind of hedging type of capability. But the key to Skytra's success and I think or what they expect to have as great success is the data. So of course it's our trading solution too, but the data they have is very comprehensive. They are getting data from an industry source that allows them to see into the vast majority of tickets sold in the industry and that then gives them a very strong foundation for an index that then can serve as the foundation for the futures instrument. If you think about other industries, other parts of our economy where there is this kind of vast amount of data that allows you to aggregate selling and buying behaviors and understanding the pricing of certain goods and services being sold in a very large percentage of them being sold then I think you could argue that this is a relevant strategy for a lot of industries and that's something that we've been thinking about a lot. We did a fun internal program where we asked our internal teams to come up with new markets ideas and then we had judges come and judge the different ideas and some of them were based specifically on what you just said as to how we think about leveraging our technology to help other industries. So that work that was ongoing and obviously I agree that there's opportunity to take that model and apply it elsewhere.\nOwen Lau: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there's no other questions in the queue. I like it turned it back to CEO Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: All right. Well, thank you very much. I just want to say that we are really a fortunate to have a particularly resilient operating and financial model at Nasdaq and that provides essential technology information and services across a diverse set of clients across the global capital markets. We also greatly benefit from our trading franchise which provides an increased revenue opportunities in times of uncertainty, while the balance of our non-trading segments prepares us well to manage our business successfully of a range of macroeconomic environments and we remain fully committed to our new long-term strategy. If anything recent events have bolstered our belief that continuing our journey as a leading technology and information services provider that operates world leading marketplaces is the best way to serve our clients and deliver returns to our shareholders over the long term. So I look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on our progress and what we continue to see as the situation evolves. And with that I want to thank you very much for your time today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on three areas: I will review Nasdaq's start to the year, in particular how we are adapting to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and our results for the first quarter of 2020. I will discuss how we are seeing the potential for our business in 2020 to be impacted by the pandemic and I will discuss the secular trends that have informed our long-term strategy and how we see them developing through and after the current pandemic crisis. I would like to begin by acknowledging that we are all navigating through an unprecedented moment in history as our global community fights the spread of COVID-19 and prepares for what will be a lasting impact on our daily life. I speak for the entire Nasdaq family when I say our thoughts are with those who are battling this virus, the families who have lost loved ones and those who are on the front lines of our economy and our society putting themselves at risk every day to care for us and our well-being. They include the millions of people who work extremely hard to make sure that we have food, power and other necessities. They are the many who are keeping critical stores open and shipping goods to our homes. They are the healthcare workers, who are putting their health and their family's health at risk to care for the sick and handle the heartbreaking loss of life. There are not enough words that can express our deep gratitude to the millions around the world who are enabling us to stay home and stay safe. The crisis has highlighted how the human spirit manifests itself and it has been truly awe-inspiring. To provide immediate assistance to those in our communities who are most at risk, we took action last month and committed $6 million in cash and in-kind donations to the COVID-19 response and relief efforts. In addition Nasdaq employees have been engaged in our philanthropic response including our double matching program which has raised more than $400,000 so far for charitable organizations fighting the pandemic. Turning to the Nasdaq community specifically from the start of the pandemic, we have been committed to the safety and well-being of the Nasdaq team as well as the broader needs of the Nasdaq client community. As COVID-19 spread across the world we moved quickly to transition our global workforce to a remote operating environment through a combination of work from home and split teams for critical on-site employees. At this time 98% of our global team are working from home to support the various country or statewide measures to flatten the curve. For those few staff around the world who are performing critical on-site functions, we're deploying extra precautions to ensure their safety. We remain deeply committed to serving our clients seamlessly while keeping our employees as safe as possible. I am so proud and impressed with the entire Nasdaq team and their commitment to our mission. In fact, our role in the economy in which we serve as a critical market operator has never been in sharper focus as it has been in the past six weeks. Additionally, our clients across the world have turned to us for technology expertise as well as insights and analytics to support their decision-making in this period of extreme challenge. We have invested and prepared for many years to be ready for what has transpired around the globe in the past several weeks. Across our markets in the U.S. and Europe, our teams across technology, operations, legal and client service are collaborating extremely well to provide a high-quality trading experience for our broker-dealer and investor clients during a period of unprecedented volatility and volume. Our market technology team, who provide strategic technology solutions to other exchanges around the world has been supporting our exchange clients with our technology expertise to support their own spikes and trading activity. Across corporate services, we are providing our corporate clients with critical insights regarding the drastic changes in their investor base and what it means for their equity relationships going forward. And in information services we are providing institutional investors with key insights into their funds positioning in relation to their peers and now with the addition of Solovis with deeper insights into their portfolios across private and public assets. These times of stress and uncertainty test us and I'm extremely grateful to the entire Nasdaq team for rising so successfully to the challenge while they also balance their own personal situations throughout this period. Turning next to our financial results. During the first quarter of this year, we set new quarterly highs of $701 million in net revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.50, up 11% and 23% respectively compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our market services business rose 21% and our non trading segments grew 7% from the prior year period. On an organic basis revenues in the non-trading segments increased 8% year-over-year. We also continue to make certain investments to advance our business acquiring ESG workflow provider OneReport and investments analytics firm Solovis during the quarter. These initiatives aligned with our disciplined strategy to maximize opportunities as a technology and analytics provider while sustaining our leadership position of our core marketplace franchise. Turning to the specific highlights in the first quarter, I will start first with our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $281 million driven by higher cash equity and equity derivatives revenue as the business was able to handle the historic surge in quoting and execution volumes despite having to navigate the many business continuity challenges as the health crisis posed. While I believe in aggregate, the exchange industry, our broker dealer intermediaries and our regulators have responded strongly and successfully to the significant challenges that came with the enormous rampant activity, I'm particularly proud of how Nasdaq's marketplaces were able to fulfill their mission to the investment community, all while we took proactive steps to protect the health and safety of our staff providing critical market functions. Our Corporate Services segment delivered revenue of $128 million in the first quarter, a 6% increase boosted by year-over-year growth in our issuer base, particularly from larger cap issuers and increased demand for our investor relations intelligence and governance offerings. Nasdaq was extremely busy in the earlier portions of the first quarter. Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 27 IPOs, a 69% win rate. We listed six of the top 10 IPOs by dollars raised including PPD Inc. which provides drug and development services to the biopharmaceutical industry, the largest U.S. IPO year to date. Our acquisition of OneReport during the period will broaden our strategic engagement and collaboration with corporate clients who are seeking clarity and efficiency in their ESG reporting. We believe this solution will further strengthen our value with the thousands of clients who already rely on our team for counsel on a range of governance and sustainability related issues through solutions like our ESG advisory service and our board assessment and collaboration technology. Now let me turn to our technology and analytics businesses. In the first quarter, our market technology segment delivered $81 million in revenues and signed $80 million in new order intake. Our annualized recurring revenue in the quarter was $257 million, [indiscernible] increase year-over-year. I'm extremely impressed with how the multitude of exchange and broker-dealer customers of Nasdaq market technology business successfully responded to the challenges of running their franchises in the midst of both market turbulence and the human health crisis. And I'm proud that our resilient marketplace technology was able to support them meaningfully as they did so. Turning to our information services segment. We delivered net revenues of $211 million in the first quarter, up $18 million or 9% year-over-year. I would like to highlight that our index revenue saw double-digit growth as AUM in Nasdaq licensed ETPs rose 5% year-over-year meaningfully outperforming the declines in a broader -- in the broad market indices over the same period and volumes in Nasdaq license equity index futures set new highs in the quarter. The AUM was bolstered by continued inflows into our flagship index products. For instance, despite the sharp declines from the market peak on February 19, through the bottom experienced on March 20 for the Nasdaq 100 over that time the largest ETF globally that tracks in Nasdaq 100 which is the Invesco QQQ ETF, experienced $5.2 billion in net inflows. In fact total ETF industry AUM for the 12-month period ending March 31 was down 0.5% according to research provider ETF GI, while Nasdaq's ETF AUM increased by 5%. We are pleased with the resilience of our index products in a period of record volatility and extreme downward pressure in the broader market. I will also note that for the second quarter, the majority of Information Services revenue came from index licensing and investment analytics products, the result of years of investment into expanding our capabilities in these higher growth areas. Now that we've covered the first quarter results, I would like to talk about the changing industry dynamics we are observing. We are fortunate to have a particularly resilient operating and financial model at Nasdaq. We deliver many essential and increasingly strategic products and services to diverse ecosystem of clients. The balance of a trading franchise that performs best during periods of maximum uncertainty and a larger recurring revenue business across Information Services, Corporate Services and Market Technology delivers relative stability in aggregate over a wide range of macroeconomic environments. Focusing on our volume driven businesses, as we look forward to the remainder of the year it is very difficult to project the volume environment. We are currently focused on the following signals. First is the continued volume strength in April with $12.7 billion in average daily share volume in U.S. equities, which is a 92% increase over last April and nearly $25 million \u2013 I mean sorry $25 million in average daily contract volume in U.S. equity options, a 51% increase over the last April. Second is a myriad of economic unknowns that the COVID-19 virus carries with it as it continues its global spread. And third is the upcoming U.S. election which when coupled with the virus for providing ingredients for continued elevated volumes for our markets in the months ahead. The flipside impact of the volatility and economic uncertainty however is the effect on IPOs. In our Corporate Services franchise, we entered 2020 with incredibly strong momentum maintaining our U.S. listings leadership through what had been a very busy period for IPOs. In addition, we steadily grew the issuer base in Nasdaq's Nordic markets and in our Corporate Solutions sub-segment after many years of investing, restructuring and reposition, we saw growth reemerge. All of these factors will continue to benefit us. However, we are beginning to see the impacts of the pandemic influence corporate issuer behavior in the near term. While a number of corporate clients are turning to our IR intelligence team for short term mandates to understand the underlying activities in their stock and demand for our ESG advisory offering continues to have momentum, the vast majority of IPO candidates are waiting to see if market conditions stabilize. We are also seeing some companies delaying corporate solutions purchasing decisions and in some cases looking to reduce near-term discretionary spend. In our Market Technology business we're extremely fortunate to have a large diverse and well-established customer base across market infrastructure operators and banks and brokers with long term locked in contracts as the underpinning of the business. Therefore, our revenue base is very solid and we had a successful year in 2019 and signing up new clients and renewing some of our key existing clients. However, our early observations of the impact of the virus in 2020 makes us more cautious about our short-term growth prospects for the remainder of the year. Specifically, our clients are dealing with the twin challenges of a surge in trading volumes and the logistical challenges of the health crisis with their staff working remotely. As a result we're seeing clients take longer to make upgrades and new purchasing decisions. They are also extending implementation schedules and instituting temporary code freezes that will delay the timing of short-term change requests. Additionally, we continue to have great engagement prospects in our new market initiatives and we believe that our sales pipeline remains strong. However, we expect the purchase and market launch decisions will likely come under additional scrutiny and review while these prospects observe the economic impacts of the virus. In our Information Services business, the dynamics of the environment bring varied implications for each of the sub segments. At investment, we have not yet felt substantial impact from the pandemic and remain focused on expanding our capabilities in client and markets, but we could see short-term results impacted by some of the following COVID-19 related factors. On the positive side, when asset owners see more alpha opportunity in more volatile markets and become more interested in active and/or alternative asset management investments evaluation data and analytics become especially important. We also believe asset owners are more likely to demand the real time portfolio analytics delivered by Solovis and those that have them are more likely to respond by adjusting their allocations. On the risks to our near-term revenue growth, while we have not yet experienced a measurable change our clients behaviors, we will be watching to see if the pandemic leads to heightened client attrition through closures of small asset managers or consolidation, as well as the potential for moderated spend per client or delayed purchasing decisions by new client prospects. Our index franchisee so far is demonstrating strong resilience is bolstered by continued elevated volumes in the futures products. However, it's hard to predict, how the market performance of index products will develop as the economic impact of the virus continues to evolve. We're very pleased to see that the investment inflows mute the downward pressure on the AUM from the drop-end market values, which we also experienced in Q4, 2018 when the market had a different valuation dislocation. However, it is always difficult to predict future investor behavior. Our market data business has demonstrated resilience across prior recessionary periods but it is not completely immune when economic downturns are more protracted. Additionally, in recent years we have successfully diversified our clients outside our traditional U.S. markets but there could be some pullback from these clients if they view real-time data to be discretionary in a time of economic pressure as this period may represent. As you know, we do not issue short-term current year revenue growth guidance at Nasdaq. Our trading businesses are subject to significant external factors such as volatility and therefore we do not provide any revenue outlook for our market services segment. For our non-trading businesses with recurring revenues as their foundation, we have issued ranges describing where we expect organic growth in these segments to average over perspective rolling three to five year period, which we consider medium term. Since early 2018, we have targeted an organic compound annual revenue growth rate across these non-trading segments collectively of 5% to 7% over that medium term 3 to 5 years period. We also said that over short term -- shorter periods of time, we expect there to be data points above and below our communicated range, especially during the most impactful peaks and troughs of the economic cycle. Over each of the past two years, we have delivered organic growth from the non-trading segments at or above the top of that 5% to 7% medium-term outlook range and we continue to believe that same range is appropriate outlook looking forward over the next 3 to 5 year period. However, in the short term taking into considerations all of the dynamics that I've just described across our businesses, while we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our business overall we see increasing risks to reaching the lower end of that 5% to 7% range collectively across our non-trading segments for the full year of 2020. We will continue to provide updates in our growth progress for 2020 in upcoming quarterly calls, as we gain more knowledge and experience in the current environment. Overall, we are proud of the resilient and diversified nature of our business with a coupling of volume driven revenue and more stable recurring revenues serving as our foundation. With our diversity we benefit from certain segments bolstering our results when others face some short-term pressures. That has been the story of Nasdaq for many years now. And overall, it provides for more stability and predictability than many of our direct peers. As a result, while we remain a performance culture where individual employment decisions are still made on the basis of each of their efforts and contributions, we have made a commitment to our employees that we will not initiate any broad-based layoffs this year. We are proud to support our employees and help them feel secure in their professional lives, while they address the challenges of COVID-19 and its implications that they have on the personal and family situations. While we actively address the particular challenges of the pandemic and related economic impacts in the near term, we're also paying close attention to what the changing world tells us about the most important long-term secular dynamics in our industry, the changes that are most impacting our clients and where we have the largest opportunities to grow as we deliver against the opportunities they create. What we are seeing overwhelmingly is that the pandemic is in many ways reinforcing these longer-term dynamics. For example, we recognized during our strategic review in 2017 that the investment management industry is going through profound change including an enlarging passive investing trend on one end of the spectrum, a private market on the other end of the spectrum and an increasingly pressured traditional active management industry in the middle. During the pandemic induced downturn, we're seeing continued positive flows into ETF despite the market pullback, while private equity firms are raising new capital that might be put to work in particularly distressed industries. Among our traditional asset management clients, it's an increasingly competitive world with certain firms outperforming the market and drawing a new capital while others face significant outflows. We believe that how we partner with asset managers to launch new innovative ETFs that help them participate in the passive trends, how we assist private companies and private equity funds with the liquidity events through the private market and how we help active managers and private equity funds compete for flows with the investment will continue to be increasingly important. In market technology, with our next-generation trade lifecycle technology platform, we see the benefits of marketplace and surveillance solutions leveraging the cloud to be scalable to any level of activity and accessible by both users and operators from anywhere in the world. We view that to be even more critical in a world that likely considers a much wider spectrum of business continuity scenarios than it ever has before. And with our corporate issuers who are faced with increasing challenges that they have to meet to effectively navigate public ownership, we believe that the need for technology enabled and highly specialized consultative partner to assist with activities such as managing buy side interaction and governance and sustainability matters will be even more essential. Over the past three years, we have set a course for transformation of our business without sacrificing the quality of service we provide to our clients and while remaining focused on value creation for our stakeholders. The results we have delivered is a rewarding indication that this strategy is working. Yet we recognize that to maintain our momentum against a business backdrop that is still digesting the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic we must continue to challenge ourselves each and every day. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying our communities are adapting to the challenges of isolation and the uncertainty of what lies ahead. These times of stress and uncertainty test us and I am proud of what we have delivered for our clients and stakeholders this past quarter. We are looking out for each other and we are continuing to get the job done for those who rely on us. We are also incredibly grateful for and inspired by the collective compassion that has surfaced as a result of this crisis particularly demonstrated by frontline healthcare and other essential workers. Moving forward in 2020, we remain focused on advancing our strategic mission. As our teams have adjusted to the remote nature of daily life, I'm reminded by one of Nasdaq's founding principles that people do not need to be in the same physical place to be part of the same community. This founding principle continues to drive us as we face the unexpected and I believe we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction this year. And with that I'll turn it over to Michael to review the financial details. Sure. Yes. Thanks Rich. So we did have a high level of order intake in the fourth quarter and that obviously then had some impact on the amount of order intake we took in on the first quarter but as a reminder the order intake can come in three different groups. So one is renewing and in some cases expanding existing clients, the contracts so that's both extending out of the contract term and in some cases expanding the services they offer. The second is new client acquisitions for trading solutions and what I will call marketplace solutions and the third is the more staffs oriented revenue that's more immediately SaaS in our surveillance business and what you're finding is the order intake that took place in Q4 the way that it flows through ARR is in the SaaS, is kind of surveillance business that's currently SaaS and any new markets that are truly SaaS that can come in pretty quickly into the ARR in the following quarter but the vast majority of the order intake either is an expanding out of contracts so that it will then start to flow into ARR as our contracts are extended or with new clients where we have to develop the solution and then deploy it, the ARR will not -- it won't show up on ARR until we've deployed the solution because we don't count the billed on costs and the billed revenue oriented revenue as ARR. So in the vast majority of the cases for the fourth-quarter order intake it is requiring us to build out the solutions first before that'll show up in ARR so there is a delay. Sure. Thanks a lot Rich. Okay. Great. Thanks. So with regard to the 1Q results and looking at how they are developing as we go through the year, I think that we -- I would say that we didn't see a lot of impact of the COVID-19 situation on our 1Q results but some because remember a lot of our clients are in Asia and so they were earlier, hit much earlier by the virus than the rest of the world and so some of the works that we were doing in that region got delayed. So I would say that there was some impact in Q1. I think that now that it's become more of a global situation, we wanted to make sure we did give you a view into what we are seeing so that you can understand were there might be delays in work that we're working on. We are still for instance doing design studies but if they're doing, if we're doing design study remotely it just takes longer to get the design studies done. And so and we are still doing them. It's actually been really great to work with our clients that way but it does take longer to get through the design work when you're having to log in on Zoom together. And then in terms of some of the new enhancements that we are working on for our clients or frankly upgrades of their trading systems or other systems. They've asked for some short-term delays while they're managing through a remote working environment and so those are the types of things that we're starting to see. We're not seeing general underlying weakness in our clients or client relationships. It's really just showing that there are other diversions of their attention right now and that will have some short-term impact on how we can recognize revenue against project related work, a short-term change requests as well as new deliveries that we're working on. In terms of the margin we are as focus as you guys are on managing the margin in the business and so the way that we're looking at that balance is we wanted to be able to continue to develop and deploy our next gen technology stack and there's work that we're doing to really fill out our SaaS capabilities against that technology and we will, our goal is to continue to do that work. We also have to make sure we're managing to our client expectations in terms of managing workload we do have but we also have the ability to look at that in terms of making sure that we're making the right decisions around building out the teams and managing the teams so that we can try to manage to the shorter term margin issues. So we are still working towards showing an expansion of margin there but as you said it will be harder with lower growth this year. Sure. So we don't communicate kind of that base revenue that you're looking for. We try to provide enough context for you to understand that we have a very broad and secure base of clients both across all of our businesses. So whether it's market technology, corporate solutions, information services and our markets business. We have active and engaged conversations and we have a very broad base of clients. So we have that the benefit of diversity and when I gave my comments I wanted you to see either what we're starting to see or what we could see as we understand this pandemic and its potential impact on our clients. But we don't provide a specific kind of revenue base number that you're looking for. We're just trying to make sure you understand how our growth could be impacted going forward through the year. In terms of our index business, the index business was impacted by three things. First, as Michael mentioned we did have a collection of unpaid invoices that we were able to secure in the quarter and that had a positive impact of $5 million but even without that we did have double-digit growth in the index business and that was driven by the fact that our AUM is up. So that's one. And that volumes in the futures of business as you know we have an agreement with CME on the futures volumes in the Nasdaq-100 index futures and those volumes were very, very high during the quarter which obviously helped supplement the growth in the business. Sure. So I think that a couple things and I'll also send it over to Michael to see if I miss anything. So the first thing is recognizing that the AUM is 5% growth in AUM but then also depends on where the AUM is coming from and in this particular case we saw strong, pretty strong reflection of AUM in our benchmark indices that tend to carry a slightly higher fee rate. So that's one to consider and then the second thing is on the futures volumes when I looked at last year, I looked at like all of last year and the future is volume revenue contributed about 12% of the overall revenue -- 12.5% of the overall revenue in the index business whereas in the first quarter it was 19%. So hopefully that will give you a sense of the scale of the change in the futures revenue but I don't know Michael if you have anything else. Okay. Thank you. Great. Thanks a lot. So I'll start with the organic growth range. I think that we've been really evaluating 2020 and we also have been looking at it long term as I mentioned, so it's kind of like what's the immediate impact and how should we make sure that we're communicating at least what we're seeing and what we know about a great unknown right now. And then also looking longer-term, are we still playing into the right trends. Are we seeing those trends either develop as they have been or even accelerate. So taking both in order on 2020 I think that, we are trying to make sure that we recognize that if things kind of are able to return to a \u201cnew normal\u201d I'm going to call it that relatively in a sustainable way as we get through the first half of this year and into the second half of the year then I think that will find that IPO has come back in albeit slower than what we had experienced last year in the first quarter. We will also expect that we will continue to have great ability to provide intelligence solutions to our investment management clients and our corporate clients and then we also have a lot of projects and a lot of opportunities within market tech that we would expect that our clients will want to hop right back to it and get those going as they see their own worlds normalized to a degree. We do think there will be a new normal though. We don't expect all of our employees to come back to the office right away. We don't expect our clients employees to come back to the office right away and so it will be a hopefully a steady improvement in the environment as we get better testing as we hopefully implement some contact tracing and we can be better at managing and equipping our employees to work safely. So I think Mike that's a new normal that's something that we would like to see and I think that gives us -- that make \u2013 it plays right into what we're good at and what we can do but we also recognize that that's not necessarily the outcome. So we wanted to give you a sense of where are there the risks and those risks to the extent they continue to manifest will make it harder for us to reach the low end of the range this year and we wanted to make sure that you were aware of that, but when we look longer term we continue to be really optimistic about where we're investing and why what we're doing is important and I actually completely agree with your comment which is that as people look forward and they say okay what do I need to do myself and where can I find a partner who can do it for me or what do I need to do on-site and what can I put into a cloud environment to make it some not as dependent on my data center and the people there. I think that we have a lot of opportunity to partner with our clients on tech. I mean I really do. I think that they will be looking for more and more solutions that can scale up, that can be operated remotely, managed remotely, that make it so that they can operate in a more of a BCP environment and I believe that what we're building and what we're doing will play into that quite nicely. In terms of the expenses I'm going to send that over to Michael because I forgot what the question was. Thank you. Sure. Okay. So I'll try to be brief but it's a big question. So the first thing I would say is you are correct that we have a sticky client base and I think that we should recognize that and I hopefully I conveyed that in my prepared remarks that we have, we do provide critical services, critical technologies, critical information that allow our clients to navigate the capital markets or operate capital markets successfully. So you are very correct we have a sticky client base and so that gives us great confidence in the overall base and foundation of our business. But when we look at growth it's driven by obviously in upgrading or even increasing the relationships we have a certain customers or finding new customers or making changes in pricing. And I think we've made our normal course changes in prices this year and those are already being reflected and through the results but when we look at the other two, I think that when it comes to our current client base whether it's corporate clients, investment management clients, broker-dealer clients or exchanges they're very busy right now. So they will look for us, to us for immediate needs and we will be able to provide them to them like we help them through the surge and traffic and volumes through their systems. We've helped corporate clients really try to understand and do some new targeting work to help them understand how to attract new investors into their names. We certainly have done a lot of work with our investment management clients and we're doing a lot of analysis now on, business continuity planning and other things that help our investment management clients. So we have a lot of really interesting short-term work and I think some of that was well reflected in the quarter but also will continue to benefit us. I think where we just want to make sure we recognize is that with our existing clients they are quite-quite busy and so decisions get slowed down and they are also dealing with their own uncertainties and so they want to make sure they kind of understand where the world might sit certainly before they make big decisions but also even with some of the smaller ones it just takes longer to get things through the process. I think that the other thing is with new customers we've had, we have a very good pipeline frankly and we continue to have a good pipeline across our business but those clients also are thinking through their own kind of how quickly can they get it to market, how quickly can they get their new customers to test the system for instance, how quickly do they want to switch over to a new service when everyone's working from home. So to me those are delays in decisions but generally speaking in our recurring revenue segments we do find that we have strong base but we have some clients who are either liking their decisions or deferring them and then or they might they haven't yet but they might so we want to make sure that you're aware of that. And then I would say that in certain places and I did mention this in my comments where we have particularly in corporate clients where we have a range of clients across multiple segments they are going through different phases as some of the segments are quite secure like healthcare and technology and other segments are managing through significant disruptions and can make different decisions around any sort of what they would consider discretionary spend. Again we haven't seen a lot of that yet but that's a risk that we recognize in our business particularly if this situation continues over a longer period of time. So that's all within our non-trading businesses that I mentioned. Within our trading businesses as I mentioned also we don't try to predict volume. We try to long ago but we don't. It's not an easy thing to predict. So we try to make sure we maintain our business and manage our business through cycles and we benefit our shareholders when we have a cycle of high volumes but we definitely try to make sure that we don't take it, we don't commit ourselves to thinking that there's going to be a high volume environment forever. We just are looking at the signals that we're seeing right now and seeing a healthy volume environment right now. So that was what I was basically trying to convey to you. I hope that helped. So you nailed it. So we are looking at that cloud data service first of all it's not for the ultra-low latency clients but it is for the broader investor base out there in the world and for clients who tailor to investors around the world and because it's delivered in a millisecond environment. So it is truly real-time and that's pretty exciting to be able to deliver that out through a cloud infrastructure and that's some engineering work we did with our cloud partner. The second thing is that it's a really light touch in terms of what the client needs to do to take it. It's a very easy API for them to ingest and to build out front-end capabilities against. So it's got this, it's a very modern language. It's very simple and it makes it so that they can ingest it and develop front-ends very quickly against it. So it's like a light, think of it as like a light development kit that allows them to take in the data a lot faster and have a lot less cost associated with managing the data and recognizing that since it is in a cloud infrastructure they're not having to take the data into and ingest it into their data centers. They can just ping it through and it'll flow through into their systems from the cloud and they can store it and they can manage it in the cloud. So our view is that it's a much lighter infrastructure as well and I would say that we are expecting to be able to see new customers. That's kind of one of the main reasons for doing it is to continue to expand our client base but we also are working with customers that we've had who might take it as a new feed like maybe they took our basic feed before and now they want to take our depth because it's a lot easier to take in. so for all those reasons we're excited but it's new. So we just launched it yesterday and we have a lot of work to do to make sure we build up that pipeline and make it a reality for us. A great question. So the first thing I would say is, I think it's a little early for companies to necessarily admit to themselves that their valuations have come down. So while I do think we are in, we have our resilient business, we have a strong cash orientation to our business, we have a lot of opportunities to grow and continue to manage our growth organically in the context of what I've been discussing this morning. And so we were there to be a really great opportunity out there that we really think is a great strategic fit and delivers a really good financial result and we have line of sight into the future of that business because that's the big thing that everyone's trying to grapple with. Then we may choose to continue to take that opportunistic approach but I think that will be more cautious in a couple areas. One is certainly making sure we're thinking about in the context of our own balance sheet and making sure we continue to have a very strong position there. And two is we really need to be able to model it successfully. And so these businesses they have to be able to see through the cycle and know it's on the other end and know that they're also growing into or managing into a trend that we believe in and so for that reason I think you're going to find that it's, I would say we're being more cautious but it certainly is something that we have, we will continue to evaluate. I think as we've said before the vast majority of our time and attention is focused on organic growth. We have the engines going and well some of them may have a little bit of a slower roll this year. I think we still feel highly excited about everything that we have going on organically. So we don't spend every minute thinking about that question but that is something that we'll consider if the opportunity is right. Okay. Great. I think I quite catch the end of that question. You mind, I just I heard -- I heard you want to talk about eVestment but I didn't quite catch the whole question. Do you mind asking it again? Okay. How about this. I'll answer your first question and then okay. I'll try to give you just color into eVestment. So in terms of the growth rate investment data and analytics it's comprised of a few things. So we've got eVestment which is definitely the largest revenue driver there. We also have Quandl and the Nasdaq Fund Network included in there. So just want to make sure everyone knows that it's not just eVestment but when we look at the growth rate of eVestment what we chose to do going into 2020 and coming through 2019 is actually try to focus on deepening our relationships with our clients which frankly is -- I think paying dividends right now. So we actually made a change in the way that we price eVestment to remove the per user charge and make it more of an enterprise charge per client, which has made it so that we've actually significantly increased usage of eVestment within the clients, but it also means that we don't have as many kind of smaller increases in per user revenues that would come in in any given period. But it does also mean that it gives us more of an opportunity to a scale eVestment across the clients, create even more stickiness with our customers and really work with them on developing and delivering new capabilities as this technology and the data it's more propagated within our customers meaning it's not just in the marketing group it's in the senior management office. It's in the fund management office now and so it gives us more of a chance to grow through new capabilities and so on the back of that that did moderate some of the growth that the near-term growth that we saw in the revenues this quarter but it also gives us a lot of stickiness and a great foundation for us to continue to grow and then I think that in general we are doing a lot of investing in eVestment in the private market space. So we've built out a really eight capability to be able to do the same thing for private investors as we can do for public market investors and that has been an area of growth but that I think will start to show up as we get through 2020 and into 2021. And so those areas, I think those are all the things that I think will drive us and continue to have very sticky and success relationships with our customers expand into private markets, continue the global expansion of the business but it did result in some slightly slower growth as we've transitioned our clients to a new pricing scheme. That's okay. Sure. So if I take it by group, so in Corporate Services business as I mentioned to the extent that some of our corporate clients are facing more near term expense challenges they may come to us and try to work with us to change some of the fees that we charge or they may have to make a decision not to take our service but those are -- I mean we have a thousands of customers who take our services. So it's still not going to be a large swath of our client base and in those cases what we have been able to do to the few that we've been working with so far is really just focusing on what are the services they really need and so we've actually been able to retune the conversation towards. So let's actually work on something that's needs more immediate needs and then we'll get back to let's say a perception study later. So they maintain their relationship with us we do a different kind of work for them and that's more relevant to the time that they're dealing with but keeps them as a customer and that's been highly successful so far. But those contracts are anywhere from one to three years generally and they generally roll, auto roll, but it does give them an opportunity to have a conversation with us every one or two or three years. In terms of the data and index business, well as you know index is a little different. So I'm going to put them to the side when it comes to our investment data analytics and some of the groups there in our data business are they, they tend to be either one-year or multi-year contracts with an eVestment but our data business is just you take it, you pay a monthly fee. So we don't tend to contractually obligated our clients over periods of time there and that's worked quite well for us frankly and it is a highly resilient business across cycles and we've been very pleased that our clients actually are coming to us and saying well how can I use your data to save money. So I'm just letting you know, we have had various good conversations with clients who are looking to take some of the proprietary data and maybe consolidate it to make it so they can actually save money against some of the other data providers that they might have. This new cloud service also gives them the flexibility to take the data directly from us as opposed to through a vendor which then also adds a layer of cost. So there are ways that we can work with them on that but we have not as I mentioned other than some of the new clients, particularly outside of the United States that have taken our data to the extent they see it as a discretionary spend they may choose not [indiscernible] later but generally, we have a very resilient business there. In terms of market tech, as you all know those contracts are longer term in nature. Surveillance agreement can be anywhere from three to five years, a market tech a transaction or an execution system or a trade life cycle system contract can be anywhere from 5 to 10 years. So they're very secured contracts. Our exchange clients are looking a lot like us. They're very resilient businesses. They're very stable businesses and so our conversations with them have been more around how can we support them through the short term, how can we make sure that we continue to work with them on upgrading and enhancing their technologies for the long term and so those conversations have remained very-very productive. So I hope that helps. Thank you. So I don't have any special knowledge of Skytra beyond the work that we're doing with them to develop their trading and clearing solutions. I think that they've actually made statements around that. So I would -- I can work with that to see if that's something that we can get more clarity on from them. I think that they are excited about being able to launch this and they want to be able to provide that hedging capability and I think that they continue to target this year for their launch. So I would say that they continue to see this as being highly relevant but I think that they would have to answer your specific question there. In terms of the broader new markets landscape it definitely has opened our minds to working with clients on that kind of hedging type of capability. But the key to Skytra's success and I think or what they expect to have as great success is the data. So of course it's our trading solution too, but the data they have is very comprehensive. They are getting data from an industry source that allows them to see into the vast majority of tickets sold in the industry and that then gives them a very strong foundation for an index that then can serve as the foundation for the futures instrument. If you think about other industries, other parts of our economy where there is this kind of vast amount of data that allows you to aggregate selling and buying behaviors and understanding the pricing of certain goods and services being sold in a very large percentage of them being sold then I think you could argue that this is a relevant strategy for a lot of industries and that's something that we've been thinking about a lot. We did a fun internal program where we asked our internal teams to come up with new markets ideas and then we had judges come and judge the different ideas and some of them were based specifically on what you just said as to how we think about leveraging our technology to help other industries. So that work that was ongoing and obviously I agree that there's opportunity to take that model and apply it elsewhere. All right. Well, thank you very much. I just want to say that we are really a fortunate to have a particularly resilient operating and financial model at Nasdaq and that provides essential technology information and services across a diverse set of clients across the global capital markets. We also greatly benefit from our trading franchise which provides an increased revenue opportunities in times of uncertainty, while the balance of our non-trading segments prepares us well to manage our business successfully of a range of macroeconomic environments and we remain fully committed to our new long-term strategy. If anything recent events have bolstered our belief that continuing our journey as a leading technology and information services provider that operates world leading marketplaces is the best way to serve our clients and deliver returns to our shareholders over the long term. So I look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on our progress and what we continue to see as the situation evolves. And with that I want to thank you very much for your time today. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael Ptasznik",
            "content": "Thank You Adena. Good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in the attachments to our press release and in the presentation that's available on our website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on pages 4 and 14. The $67 million increase in reported net revenue of $701 million is the net result for organic growth of $81 million including a 22% organic increase in market services and an 8% organic growth in the non-trading segments. An $8 million net negative impacts from acquisitions and divestitures and a $6 million unfavorable impacts from changes in foreign exchange rates. I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Information Services revenues which as reflected on pages 5 and 14 increased $18 million or 9%. Organic revenue growth during the period was also 9% reflecting growth in the index and investment data and analytics businesses. Included in index revenues is a $5 million collection of previously unpaid license usage fees. Market Technology revenue as shown on pages 6 and 14 increased $4 million or 5% with organic growth of $5 million or 6%. The organic increase was partially offset by a negative $2 million impact from unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Organic growth during the period primarily reflects an increase in software-as-a-service surveillance revenues and an increase in software delivery and support projects. As Adena mentioned annualized recurring revenue or ARR rose 9% compared to the prior year period. This increase was the net of an adverse impact from changes in foreign exchange rates which also affected the comparison to the preceding fourth quarter of 2019. Without that impact the year-over-year growth in ARR was 11%. Turning to Corporate Services on pages 7 and 14, revenues increased $7 million or 6%. Organic revenue growth was also 6% or $7 million reflecting an increase in the total number of listed companies and annual renewal fees as well as higher governance solutions revenues and IR intelligence revenues. Market Services net revenues on pages 8 and 14 saw a $48 million or 21% increase. Excluding the negative $3 million impact from unfavorable changes in Foreign Exchange the organic revenue increases was $51 million or 22%. Organic increase during the period primarily reflects an increase in cash equities and equities derivatives net revenues due to the higher industry trading volumes. Now turning to pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $14 million to $336 million. The change reflects a $23 million or 7% organic increase, most of which was due to the impact of higher achievement within our performance-based compensation programs in relation to the higher organic growth. This is partially offset by $5 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a $4 million payroll impacts from changes in foreign exchange rates. Turning to slide 10. We are updating our 2020 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Adjusting largely for foreign exchange rates and the recent acquisitions of Solovis and OneReport, the midpoint of the expense range represents an approximate 3% organic increase year-over-year. This 3% organic increase is consistent with our medium-term 3% expectation and is unchanged from the three months ago when we reported fourth quarter results. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased $53 million in the first quarter of 2020 and the non-GAAP operating margin was 52% compared with 49% in the prior year period. The 300 basis point increase in the margin year-over-year reflects a strong operating leverage particularly in our Market Services business as well as multi-year efforts to enhance the company's scalability. Though we would expect some near-term reversion should market volumes moderate. Net interest expense was $24 million in the first quarter 2020, a decrease of $10 million primarily due to our debt refinancing in the first half of 2019. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 26.5% for the first quarter of 2020, for full year 2020 we expect a non-GAAP tax rate to be between 25.5% and 27.5%. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2020 was $251 million or $1.50 per diluted share compared to $204 million or $1.22 per diluted share in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of Section 31 fees, which is a pass-through fees collected on behalf of the SEC, free cash flow in the first quarter of 2020 was $380 million. Now, let me turn to the balance sheet, where we've taken actions to strengthen our liquidity and cash position and address refinancing risks in response to the uncertainties posed by the COVID-19 and related economic impacts. First, in February we took advantage of relatively low rates in the Euro bond market to refinance the $600 million 2021 Euro bond with a new 10 year, $600 million 2030 Euro bond, reducing our borrowing costs from 3.875% to 0.875% annually. This also eliminated near-term bond maturities until May of 2023. Then starting in March, we observe conditions in the market for tier 2 commercial paper issuers were deteriorated impacting both costs and actionable duration of CP issues. And so we borrowed under a revolving credit line to eliminate funding uncertainties. Among Nasdaq funding sources are revolver serves the principal purpose to provide liquidity and act as a backstop on our commercial paper program, so that if we encountered a time when issuing commercial paper was unavailable or unattractive, we would have the option of borrowing on a revolving credit line instead. We typically maintained around $400 million to $500 million in commercial paper and given the uncertainty in the debt market during March we decided to borrow approximately $800 million of our available liquidity on the revolver. The approximate $800 million provided the company the ability to repair commercial paper including the remaining $350 million as it comes due over the balance of Q2 plus create an additional cash cushion of approximately $300 million. Looking forward we expect to maintain this more conservative cash position in the near term and as always, we weigh funding alternatives which include utilizing our borrowings under the revolver, returning to the commercial paper markets if conditions are attractive or issuing long-term debt. Now turning to slide 11. The net of these actions is that at the end of Q1, 2020 debt increased by $721 million versus Q4 of 2019 primarily due to the net borrowing of approximately $800 million on revolver. This is partially offset by a net reduction in other debt instruments. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.0 times up 0.4 times versus the fourth quarter of 2019 but our net debt to EBITDA was 2.3 times unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2019. While adjusting our balance sheet positioning to enhance our liquidity brings slightly higher interest expense it has enabled us to have uninterrupted ability to continue executing our capital deployment plan. For example, during the first quarter of 2020 the company funded the two aforementioned tuck-in acquisitions Solovis and OneReport as well as continued funding of our important R&D initiatives such as our work to expand investment solutions set to serve private equity investors and the continued rollout of our SaaS market technology model. Also during the first quarter of 2020, the company paid a common dividend in the aggregate of $78 million and repurchase common stock in the amount of $122 million. With an additional $30 million of repurchases completed thus far in Q2, we have largely offset the dilution from our equity programs for 2020. Today the company also announced that our board has approved a 4% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.49 per share which takes into account our growth in income and cash flow over the last year but also the heightened uncertainties around the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic's future macroeconomic impacts. Looking forward, we plan to continue with our stated capital deployment priorities, of working to identify investment opportunities that meet our strategic and financial objectives, of maintaining our dividend policy with the intention to provide stockholders with regular and growing dividends over the long term as earnings and cash flow grow, of executing our buyback program to target a stable share count and to manage balance sheet leverage to maintaining an investment grade credit profile. With that I thank you for your time and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. No, I think it's primarily within that futures revenue is -- we do have a new contract with CME and so when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, any additional volumes, plus e-mini micros that they have when you take that all into account with the mix, etc. It adds up in the results that we're seeing plus in addition to $5 million Adena mentioned earlier and that I mentioned in my remarks. Yes. Thanks Chris. I think the simple answer is it's really built in suspenders as we're going through an unprecedented time something that comes along once every hundred years and you're in a situation when we were in March with the markets were very volatile. The short term funding markets obviously had have tightened up substantially and honestly in a position like this it's just a matter of having liquidity is a very good thing to have and it just allows us to sleep well at night. So there was no immediate need for that additional buffer. It honestly was just putting some additional cash on the balance sheet so that we had some protection for unforeseen circumstances again given just the uncertainty around the events. And as things settle down and things now with the government stimulus and the markets returning to normal we will take a look to see whether we need to maintain that additional $300 million or so and will pay down the revolver when we feel comfortable but it was really just like I said it built-in suspenders approach. Yes. Thank Adena. The answer on the expenses and whether it's a trading or the non-trading expenses. I think Nasdaq has historically shown that it's very efficiency focused organization and we do look at our expenses on a very detailed basis across our different segments and depending on what's happening with respect to the nature of the business we do have some levers that we can affect. We obviously have some discretionary spend across our different programs. Number one we'll take a look at those and that includes things like marketing and travel and entertainment and other types of opportunities. In addition to that we do have our initiatives and there's \u2013 these initiatives that Adena referred to earlier in our R&D program but there's also a number of other underlying initiatives that as an organization you have the opportunity to either do faster or slow down depending on the nature of the environment that we're facing and then you can always continue to look at other elements within the cost space. We now have much more flexibility with respect to our working environment and so we'll take those things into account. So I think will be very cost-conscious and we will obviously observe the environment and adjust our expenses accordingly."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Ed Ditmire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.

Actual results may differ materially from these projections. And information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I'll now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let me first note how proud I am of the resilience of Nasdaq's business, the nimbleness and dedication of our global team and the trusted relationships we have with our clients. We are certainly familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be as we continue to navigate a dynamic pandemic and economic landscape. Before I turn to our performance, I would briefly like to address the current market environment. While the markets have experienced increased levels of volatility since the start of the year, we maintain a positive overall economic outlook going into 2022 as the underlying economy continues to have the ingredients for continued growth. Notably, consumer demand for products and services remains high. The ongoing digital transformation of industry continues to drive long-term demand for advanced software and other technology and market innovations. And the resulting employment environment is very strong. That said, there are several factors driving the current market volatility. Notably, due to the cyclical and structural issues we are entering 2022 with a tight labor market and supply chain challenges, both of which are contributing to inflationary pressures. Those pressures are then creating uncertainty around the pace and rate of monetary policy adjustments. Additionally, there are broader geopolitical challenges and continued pandemic impacts that are adding to the macro uncertainty. So, while our overall outlook remains positive, we expect the confluence of market-driven factors, and macroeconomic and political factors to continue to drive volatility over the near term. Within that context, we also remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. For example, we've seen significantly higher trading volumes and within the last week, the industry processed and Nasdaq processed a new record number of messages in a single trading day. We continue to have a healthy pipeline of companies expecting to tap the public markets during 2022. In fact, we have more than double the number of S1s on file with the SEC compared to the prior year period, although market volatility could cause some delays to IPO, timing, something we are monitoring closely. And in our index business, we expect index asset values to experience some impact associated with various market levels and investor appetite for products tracking our indexes, but also the benefit from higher futures trading volume due to the use of our core indexes in market hedging strategies. The diversification of our business over the past number of years has created a flywheel effect between our foundational U.S. and European marketplaces and the technology solutions we deliver to thousands of clients across public companies, investment managers, and banks, as well as the 100 plus market infrastructure operators, all of whom rely on our mission critical software to navigate the financial system successfully. This is especially the case during these periods of heightened market turbulence. We help asset owners rebalance their portfolios and manage asset allocation decisions. We enable banks and brokers to prevent financial crime while handling increased investor activity. We provide critical investor relations insights to corporate clients to understand changes in their investor base. And we empower exchanges around the world to handle the market volumes and volatility. Nasdaq is there as a critical partner across the financial markets and our business has demonstrated time and again, that we can achieve success in the face of these types of backdrops. I'm confident this time will be no different. Let's now turn to our results. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial and business performance; the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction; and an update on Nasdaq's cloud journey; as well as our ambitions for 2022 and beyond. I'll then turn the call over to Ann who will provide further details about our results, as well as give updates on our guidance, capital deployment and sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A. Let's begin with our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. First, on the fourth quarter, we achieved $885 million in net revenues, a 12% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of a $1.93 rose 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year of 2021 net revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from the prior year. We achieved 14% organic growth with double digit contributions from both the Solutions segments and Market Services. Our annualized recurring revenue or ARR ended the year at $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This underscores our continued progress across key secular growth opportunities, including building out our Anti Financial Crime Technology, as well as our analytics and workflow solutions for asset owners. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we see some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 representing a 34% \u2013 I'm sorry, representing 34% of total company, ARR, sorry, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 43% year-over-year increase in annualized SaaS revenues primarily reflects the inclusion of Verafin, as well as strong organic growth in our markets surveillance and investment analytics businesses. Because of our 2021 performance, we entered 2022 with solid momentum and we intend to lean into our success as we operate our advanced client-led technology solutions and our foundational marketplace businesses diligently in the months ahead. Now I'm going to turn to specific highlights of our businesses focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Solutions segments businesses delivered combined total revenues of $581 million during the fourth quarter and 19% increase from the prior year period, driven notably by standout performances from index and listing services, exciting momentum in our investment analytics offerings and strong performance in our Anti Financial Crime offerings, including the impact of the acquisition of Verafin.  In our investment intelligence segment, we delivered $288 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, 18% increase from the prior year period with contributions from across the business. We continue to invest in product innovation to meet the evolving needs of our clients.  During the quarter, we brought to the market several new products that are seeing encouraging initial demand. Let me highlight a few. Data Fabric, which is our new, enhanced, cloud-based offering is a powerful new feature inside of Nasdaq's Data Link that allows clients to bring their own data to the platform and have it securely managed as a service. The early traction we observed with Data Fabric is encouraging and this offering is quickly becoming a critical part of our clients' investment workflows. And in our Index franchise, we saw demand growth for the new offerings in our expanded Nasdaq-100 related and ESG focused indexes, including two new sustainability focused ETFs tracking the Nasdaq-100 ESG and the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ESG indexes. In total 61 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes launched in 2021, accumulating $2.9 billion in assets through the end of the fourth quarter. Notably, 67% of ETF launches in the year were outside the U.S., demonstrating the strong international demand for Nasdaq's index franchise. Turning to investment analytics building upon our successful partnerships with leading investment consultants that were announced during 2021 Nasdaq's Asset Owner Solutions now distributes investment research and insights from Mercer and Aon among others to our growing community of asset owners and asset managers on the investment platform. This is just one of several ways we're increasing the value of investment and the broader asset owner solutions offering to our clients. And I'm incredibly pleased to see the tremendous sales growth from new clients reported by eVestment and Solovis for the full year of 2021. Combined new sales in 2021 totaled $26 million, an increase of 41% over the prior year, driven in large part by 79% new sales growth in the Asset Owner business. And Solovis\u2019 new sales grew 145% across all applying groups. Turning next to our Market Technology segment, we delivered $131 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results. More broadly, we saw continued growth and demand for our SaaS-based offerings. Both fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions, which we call FRAML and from the market and trade surveillance areas of our Anti Financial Crime Technology, as well as a growing number of market operators, utilizing our cloud native marketplace solutions. Over the course of 2021 I'm pleased to report that in addition to 197 new banks, credit unions and FinTech companies that adopted Verafin, our other market technology businesses welcomed to 31 new customers of which 26 chose our SaaS solutions. Though Market Technology overall had a transformational year in 2021, in particular, as we grow Nasdaq into an Anti Financial Crime leader with related shifts in revenue composition, we have an equal focus on catalyzing of recovery in the growth of our Solutions business for our market infrastructure operators. Revenues recognized in that business decreased in the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, due to factors including lower nonrecurring professional services revenue caused in part by pandemic-related logistical challenge that we've previously disclosed. However, we're seeing some encouraging trends that bring us incrementally closer to a positive inflection in revenue. First, we're making progress on some of the larger, more complex implementations that have been more exposed to the pandemic-related challenges of travel and restrictions to onsite collaboration. In particular, two key projects are approaching their first go live and acceptance phases in the first quarter of 2022. And in a third, the collaboration with the client resulted in its scope and timeline adjusted to reflect both expanding customer needs, balanced against evolving delivery timeline realities. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we achieved strong new order intake of $142 million, capping a record full year of $378 million, excluding Verafin, which constitutes a very substantial 58% increase in new order intake from 2020 that was highly impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Further, we have seen a substantial uptick in early-stage discussions with clients who want to learn more about our progress bringing the benefits of the cloud and managed services to their own markets. We are excited to see how that can play out not only in driving further growth in new contracts down the line, but also because SaaS and managed service projects entail simpler delivery processes versus our legacy on-premises installations. Obviously the duration of the pandemic has exceeded everyone's expectations. However, we are encouraged by the growing interest in our next gen capabilities and the future opportunities to increase the way we serve market infrastructure operators to compliment the strong growth that we see today in our larger Anti Financial Crime offerings. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our market services segment delivered net revenues of $303 million during the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 5% from the prior year period. We maintained our strong competitive performance amid a dynamic trading backdrop as the retail and institutional investment communities found new opportunities across equities and options to drive their strategies. Our U.S. options business set a new annual record for trading volumes in 2021. And we are starting 2022 with new records being set in volumes and message traffic. In early December we, announced our decision to begin the migration of our options markets to the cloud beginning in 2022, starting with our Nasdaq MRX Options market. This innovation in the infrastructure that underpins our markets will create more elasticity in our capacity while maintaining or improving the performance of our clients that our clients have come to expect from us. This will make \u2013 this will be made possible with the build out of the broader cloud infrastructure within the Carteret data center supported by AWS and our local partner Equinix. I will cover this topic in more details in few minutes. Turning to U.S. cash equities, the increase of our volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 mirrored the industry volume increase at approximately 3%. And in the Nordic markets, we continue to experience strong trading performance, including a matched equity market share among lit venues of over 75%. The European equities value traded per day also increased 23% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Finally, our Corporate Platforms segment delivered net revenues of $162 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase driven primarily by our continued leadership and new listings across our U.S. and European markets, as well as growth and demand for our complimentary IR and ESG services. For the ninth consecutive year, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in 2021 with 752, capitalizing on one of the strongest years for new issuances over the last two decades. And with a 73% overall IPO win rate. Nasdaq also ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raise for the third quarter with \u2013 I'm sorry for the third year. So let me read that again, Nasdaq also ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised for the third year, with $181 billion and listed nine of the top 10 U.S. based IPOs in terms of proceeds raise. We also had 33 new companies switched their corporate listings to Nasdaq in 2021, including Honeywell, Palo Alto Networks and Baker Hughes, representing an aggregate of $361 billion in global equity market capitalization. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq in the last decade has exceeded $1.7 trillion. In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also experienced a record year for new listings with 207 companies raising over $15 billion. And for the first time ever Nasdaq Stockholm facilitated more capital raised than any other country in the EU, while our combined Nordic exchanges had more IPOs than any other market operator in Europe. Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions drove 4% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter within the IR and ESG business. We continue to see deepened client engagement across Nasdaq IR Insight and Advisory, and have also invested in the expansion of our ESG advisory and reporting services to corporate clients. We now provide those services in our portfolio solutions offered to companies who list on our U.S. market. Next I'd like to provide an update on the important progress we made in 2021 to advance our cloud journey and how these milestones support our broader strategic vision to unlock potential growth \u2013 growth potential, sorry and accelerate our transition to a SaaS business model in our technology data and investment analytics businesses. Our move to the cloud began over a decade ago. And we have used its innovation capabilities to deliver client-driven solutions while evolving our own infrastructure for digital future. In fact, a wide range of Nasdaq solutions are already in the cloud today. We've also advanced our market's ecosystem by migrating several of our market surrounding systems that have greatly benefited from the hyper scaling that the cloud affords us to manage elevated volumes in the world's markets. We were therefore very excited to announce in December a multi-year partnership with Amazon Web Services to build the next generation of cloud enabled infrastructure for the world's capital markets, committing to move one of our markets to the cloud this year. The partnership with AWS will accelerate the migration of our North American markets to the cloud through a phased approach. Specifically this year, we plan to move our MRX Options market to our generation trading technology and as part of that migration, we also plan to move MRX into AWS's cloud environment within the Carteret data center. The new edge computing solution that we co-designed with AWS may also be used by other market infrastructure operators and market participants to move their trading systems to the cloud. And we look forward to engaging with our market technology clients on this future-oriented approach to managing market infrastructure. In addition, the partnership will include opportunities to explore new ways to leverage AWS's cloud capabilities across Nasdaq's Anti Financial Crime, data and investment analytics, as well as our market infrastructure software businesses. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, Nasdaq made notable progress against our broader strategic journey in 2021. As we continue that path, we would like to share our core ambitions and execution priorities for 2022 and beyond which we detail on Page 10 of the presentation. First, we want to reinforce a culture of inclusive, frozen prosperity within our own organization. We want to continue increasing collaboration across our entire enterprise to deliver more through our deep client relationships. To further increase our value proposition as an employer, and to continue to advance our sustainability practices. Second, we want to advance our client-first approach to serving the financial ecosystem. We will continue to deliver our core marketplace solutions with superior client service, utmost integrity, and technological excellence. We will also continue to listen to our client's need as we expand our offerings in index, investment analytics, Anti Financial Crime and ESG solutions. Third, we are accelerating our technology modernization, our AWS partnership and how our marching forward on the cloud is an incredible example of this. But we have additional opportunities to increasingly leverage machine learning within our offerings, as well as our agile development within more of our innovation areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions, in the quarters to come. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2021 for our company. We remain relentlessly focused on a advancing our strategic position as a technology company that is advancing the financial system as we move forward into 2022 capitalizing on the strong momentum generated last year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our investor relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter performance beginning on Slide 12 of the presentation. The 12% increase in reported net revenue of $885 million is the net result of organic growth of 10%, including 12% organic increase in the solution segments and a 6% organic increase in market services. And the contribution from Verafin as well as is the impact from divestitures partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 18% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 51% increased three percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $328 million or $1.93 per diluted share compared to $268 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 13, as Adena mentioned earlier, annualized recurring revenue or ARR totaled $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million, an increase of 43%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 9% year-over-year. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 14 through 17. Starting with market technology, revenue increased $25 million or 24%. The increase reflects the positive $35 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and the $3 million increase in our existing Anti Financial Crime Technology business, partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $10 million in our market infrastructure technology business. Excluding a $4 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year; and Anti Financial Crime Technology would have been $76 million with both our existing Surveillance and Verafin's FRAML Solutions continuing to exhibit strong momentum. On a sequential basis and excluding the impact of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue, Verafin revenues of $39 million in the fourth quarter compares to $36 million in the third quarter. As we discussed last quarter, the revenue decline within the Market Infrastructure Technology business was impacted primarily by the successful completion of mid-year of a significant long-term maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology as well as decrease more broadly in change requests and installation revenues mostly due to capacity constraints we are working through as a result of logistical implications of the pandemic. That said, as Adena discussed a few minutes ago, we see some encouraging signs, including the $142 million of order intake during the quarter. ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 51% compared to the prior year. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period, an increase compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a $25 million reserve related to an unexpected loss on an implementation project taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $4 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $43 million or 18%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $44 million. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as a meaningful contribution from analytics. ARR was $567 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 18% compared to the prior year period to $424 billion, including $74 billion from net inflows and an $83 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $92 billion in net negative impact related to the ETP sponsor switches that we have discussed earlier in 2021. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% is down 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. One note looking forward to the first quarter of 2022. Trading activity of instruments licensed to our Indexes achieved certain annual thresholds mid-year that resulted in an increase in licensing economics in the second half of the year. Similar to what we described in the call one-year ago, as we begin 2022, the economics of certain agreements reset for the New Year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $23 million or 17%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 23% expansion in our listed corporate issuer base, primarily due to a higher number of IPOs as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and newer ESG and reporting offerings. Corporate Platforms ARR was $546 million and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 37% increased 7 percentage points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the continued increase in the listed issuer base. Market Services net revenues increased $15 million or 5%. The organic revenue increase was $17 million or 6%, and there was a $2 million negative impact from changes in tax rates. The organic increase primarily reflects higher equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 61% was unchanged from the prior year period. Turning to Page 18 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $430 million; the increase reflects a $6 million or 1% organic increase and a $24 million increase from the net impact of the acquisition and divestitures, partially offset by a $2 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the $25 million reserve in the Market Technology segment taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, the organic expense increase totaled 8%. The organic expense increase has two main drivers: first, higher compensation expense, reflecting our continued investment to drive growth as well as an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, marketing and advertising expense driven by higher level of new listing activity. We are initiating our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.68 billion to $1.76 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint has three components. First, a core increase compared to 2021 at approximately the mid-point of our medium-term expense growth objective of 3% to 6%. The majority of which is being allocated to our highest growth product areas: Anti Fin Crime, Index, Analytics and ESG. Second is a roughly 2% additional increase, reflecting certain shorter-term factors including costs related to the heightened competition for talent in today's market, and inflationary pressures as well as some budgeted rebounding costs associated with return to office and travel and entertainment. Third, there is also the full year impact of the 2021 M&A activity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which together net to a decrease of under 1%. Our expense philosophy and budget is driven by our strong growth opportunities and our willingness to invest to properly support execution against them. And as Adena went over earlier in her remarks, our positioning versus these large and growing opportunities has never been better. We expect the 2022 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 19. Debt decreased by $97 million versus 3Q 2021, primarily due to a net payment of $60 million of commercial paper and a $39 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1 times, down from 3.2 times in the third quarter of 2021. Let me take a moment now to update you on stock repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, in addition to retiring 0.4 million shares of stock representing the final 20% of the $475 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR agreement, we entered into in July of 2021, the company also repurchased an additional $58 million in shares in 4Q 2021. Moving to the first quarter of 2022, thus far in January we have repurchased $142 million in stock. And later this week, we plan to execute a second ASR for $325 million, which we expect to fully complete in the first quarter of 2022. These repurchase plans are consistent with our desire as part of our capital plan to maintain a stable share count and with our intention to materially offset the dilutive impacts of the NFI divestiture beyond the first 12 months of that transaction closing. Turning to Slide 20, I want to touch on Nasdaq's unique set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact and the strong momentum we have in executing against them. In terms of what makes our ESG opportunities unique, we're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders. But we have also positioned ourselves to deliver high impact outside the organization through our Anti Fin Crime Solutions and ESG products and services, our position as a marketplace operator to advance standards and practices and our efforts to further financial inclusion through focused charitable activities and volunteerism. As we look back at 2021, we have made significant progress across all pillars of ESG. We meaningfully expanded our disclosures and commitments, including our first-ever task force on climate-related financial disclosures report; we enhanced our suppliers' sustainability program, received SEC approval on our Board diversity rule and added Puro Earth, a provider of carbon removal solutions to our growing suite of ESG product offerings. We are pleased to see several third-party ESG research and ratings firms recognize our meaningful progress over the year, including Sustainalytics, ISS, CDP, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the Human Rights Equality Index and the just capital ranking of 100 companies to provide critical business \u2013 who prioritize critical business behaviors. We're also moving further in 2022. Earlier this month, Nasdaq announced its partnership with TRIBE Freedom Foundation, a charity focused on fighting human trafficking and modern slavery. Nasdaq will support TRIBE in the creation of a survivor financial empowerment program, a centralized portal including content, practical tools and educational financial literacy material tailored to support survivors of human trafficking. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Adena; good morning, Ann.\nAdena Friedman: Hey, Rich.\nRich Repetto: Hey, Adena. First, congrats on the AWS partnership because it just shows that market trends continue to move in your favor, which is by no means an accident. I don't think either. But anyway, I got a question. Given this technology focus, I got a question on Market Technology; you're going to kill me for this question. But we had a record quarter, revenue increased 15%, high order intake increase in SaaS, the margin expanded, but the ARR stayed flat quarter-to-quarter. It was the only segment where the ARR did stay flat. So can you give us some insight into the incremental, I guess, revenue composition in the pick-up in the revenues and Market Technology?\nAdena Friedman: Well, first of all, Rich, we welcome all of your questions. So thank you for that, and thanks for the mention on AWS. But Ann is going to go ahead and give you some color on that.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So thanks for the question, Rich. We did \u2013 we were flat in ARR for Market Tech overall and so there's a couple of different pieces to it. What I would say is we saw growth in the Anti Financial Crime portion of ARR and some \u2013 a slight decline in the market infrastructure technology piece of ARR as we had a contract that was \u2013 there was a duplicate contract that we were serving a client in transition that rolled off. So a minor thing there. What we're also seeing, when you see the revenue growth in the Market Technology business, a lot of that growth is \u2013 in this quarter is coming from additional change requests and the seasonal type items we see in the fourth quarter. Those things don't contribute to ARR but I will want to just point on the positive side that we had a very strong order intake quarter in the fourth quarter and also a record order intake number for the year in marketplace infrastructure attack. And so when you think about the future, while we won't see that coming into ARR right away because there's an implementation phase in many of those projects, we will see the benefits in ARR over time.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I think 1 other just piece of color on the order intake for the year, when we look at it, well more than 50% of the order intake is from either expansions of our relationships with existing clients or from new clients. So it's a net new revenue opportunity for us as we execute against these contracts.\nRich Repetto: Yes. The positive thing is you get us focused on ARR. So...\nAdena Friedman: I agree. That's a great thing. Thank you.\nRich Repetto: Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning everyone. Just want to talk about the 2022 outlook a little bit more in terms of organic growth. I know you have your medium-term guide here, 6% to 9%, starting this year. Obviously, last year was great. And I know some of the things that impacted a number like the Index business obviously had a bad start to the year. I think AUM is down 12% or so year-to-date, if my numbers are right. But I think even with that and looking at some of the exit rates and some of the other businesses, that 6% to 9% seems fairly safe. So I was just wondering if you could give us any commentary on how you feel about that 6% to 9% for fiscal year 2022 and any other color would be great. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. Thanks, Alex. So first of all we continue to support our medium-term, long-term outlook on our Solutions segment revenues in terms of the outlook that we provided to you around that 6% to 9%. I think that all of the businesses have slightly different dynamics. But the one thing I would agree with you on is that the entry rate for those businesses is quite strong. So we had a really strong end to 2021. And then, of course, with ARR, annual recurring revenue, it kind of portends to a strong entry rate for 2022. But as we look at kind of the longer \u2013 medium- to long-term trends of the business, we continue to support that 6% to 9%. And as we continue to perform and execute and grow and expand the businesses, like we did when we announced the Verafin deal, we will certainly make the appropriate adjustments there. But I think, Alex, that as you know, it's always \u2013 it's a very dynamic environment. So we feel very comfortable with that outlook, and we will see how we execute against it this year.\nAlex Kramm: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to also talk about just kind of the outlook for Market Services and understanding that volumes are going to come and be what they are. But thinking about capture rates within both options and equities, whether that's because of mix or any competitive factors, how you're thinking about those into 2022?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. You actually pointed out a lot of key contributors, Dan. So capture is really \u2013 is definitely mix plays a big role in that. The types of \u2013 the types of instruments that are also more heavily traded in any given period of time, and then both also deliberate actions that we might want to take in order to attract certain volumes into our markets from a competitive perspective. So as you know, with more retail, particularly in options just to point out, and more \u2013 and heavier volumes in what I would call the price time markets in options during turbulent times, those venues carry with them a lower capture. Whereas in our Philex and our ISC marketplaces that have support more complex transactions have a higher capture. So any time where you see more retail and more volumes coming in to the price time venues you're going to see capture change. But then at the same time, we do try to manage our capture quite actively in terms of attracting certain order flow into our market stand. So that's a \u2013 there's a lot of dynamics underpinning that. But what we look at is the mix of capture and market share and volumes to try to make sure we're optimizing the results for our shareholders. And I think we've done an excellent job of that, really maintaining, I think a really strong marketplace across all of our businesses, all of our markets in a highly competitive time for the marketplace.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I have a question about your partnership with AWS. When people saw this news about this partnership, I think many of them understand this partnership from the cost perspective. But could you please explain a little bit more about like if you have an example, if there's any revenue opportunity here? And Adena, you mentioned the migration, I think, option market first and then your target over the next 12 months. But could you please talk about the pace of when do you expect to complete all the migrations? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Owen. So yes, our AWS partnership actually, I think is really unique because there are a few things. First of all, we do have a lot of our technology services today that are already cloud-based in AWS and also in Azure. And so we have already have, I think a lot of experience in working in the cloud. So as we start to really focus in on the marketplace businesses, and we start to bring our markets into the cloud environment. I think we're doing it in a really, really thoughtful way. But what's really cool and I think cook and unique about the relationship that we've developed here is that bringing AWS into the Carteret data center. And then Equinix has committed to expanding the data center very significantly. We're doubling size of the data center, doubling the power into the data center. So as we create this kind of \u2013 this best private local zone for AWS in Carteret, number one, it makes it much easier for our clients to migrate to the cloud environment that they're going to create inside the data center. And number two, it gives us more space, more power to offer additional services to our clients and to give our clients a chance actually to bring more of their surrounding systems, more of their trading systems into a cloud environment, but in a very controlled way. So it gives us expansion opportunities within Carteret and ways to expand our client relationships there. And then with the go-to-market plans that we have with AWS with our market technology clients around the world, this private local zone construct and the ultra-low latency edge compute system that we co-designed with them we can then deploy that to other major markets around the world and help them with their cloud journeys. And that gives us a chance to be more of a, number one, to deploy our cloud-based marketplace solutions, which we also are implementing for MRX. And then number two, to become more of a managed service provider to our Market Tech clients, which then builds a bigger relationship with them that accrues to our benefit. So a lot of revenue opportunity there in the coming years. I just want to say, those are all long-term, kind of think about the data center, for instance, it's going to take a couple of years to build out the data center. It will take some time for us to deploy our cloud solutions to our Market Tech clients. But we see a really nice medium-to-long-term journey that we can have with AWS on that. In terms of our own markets and moving our markets, we are starting with MRX in 2022, we want to gain some experience with it. We want to hear from our clients as we manage the migration and complete it. And then we will set a more of a targeted time line for how we'll continue the migration of our markets in the U.S. But I want to say we want to start with the first one before we commit to a very specific schedule for the rest.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I had a follow-up with respect to the Market Tech business, particularly the comment around the order intake, 50% plus expansion with existing clients and new clients definitely encouraging. Can we get the breakdown between the infrastructure business and then the financial crime services business within that? And then Adena, to your point around accelerating momentum in some of the conversations you're seeing on the import truck aside. Can you help contextualize that a little more in terms of what that means for revenue growth for 2022 in that part of the model?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. So first of all, the order intake numbers that we provide still do not include Verafin. So it only includes our trade and market surveillance business, in addition to the market infrastructure operator business. And I just want to say that the majority of the \u2013 I would say, the large majority of order intake is related to our market infrastructure operator clients because of the fact that they tend to be longer-term contracts. Our trade and market surveillance contracts tend to be shorter in duration and smaller in size. So I think that you should assume that the large majority of ARR is related to market infrastructure operators. Ann you're saying $20 million or 10%?\nAnn Dennison: $20 million.\nAdena Friedman: So about $20 million of the order intake is related to our market and trade surveillance business. Just to give you a sense of the size. In terms of \u2013 as we look into 2022, I think it's important to note a few things. Ann mentioned the fact that in the latter half of last year, we had a long-standing client who has \u2013 will continue to license our software, but it was always planned that they would come off our service and maintenance agreement, which is a recurring revenue part of the contract. So that happened in the second half of last year. I think in the third quarter, we announced that. That has to flow through the full year. So that will impact the first half of 2022. Then we also have two of our larger implementations going live with their first phase in the first half of 2022, which obviously gets us then into a different and a stronger revenue mode with them going into the latter half of 2022. And then we have this big set of new order intake that we took in during 2021. And that will take a while for that to flow into the revenue as we complete the implementations of that. So you should assume that you're going to see more momentum as we go through the year of 2022 and digest that order intake as well as turn some of our clients into production clients and get through that full year impact from that one contract. So I think you'll assume \u2013 you just see more momentum going through the latter half of the year.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nAdena Friedman: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So I had a follow-up on Market Technology, but I want to isolate it around Verafin. And I appreciate Ann's comments that revenues are still growing quickly at 30% year-over-year. But as you leverage the network effect of Nasdaq's Tier 1 and Tier 2 financial services relationships, do you expect this revenue growth rate to remain robust? Or could there be some deceleration just as the larger revenue base affects it through the law of large numbers?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I mean, we continue to see massive opportunity for the Verafin organization in three areas. One is as you mentioned, moving up to the larger banks. And we are \u2013 we have signed some really great clients getting into some of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. And we actually have several POCs running with some of the largest banks as they're looking at our fraud solutions and really trying to evaluate that. So those sales cycles are longer, but obviously, the contracts are bigger. So we definitely see a lot of momentum there. The second is, as we look at global expansion and going into Europe, we do have one client that's fully live and working with us. And we're building out a pipeline now to help support more clients in Europe and making sure our solutions are geared towards the European landscape. And so that's an area of focus for us, but that \u2013 if that door opens well and we execute well there, that's just a huge growth area for us over the long term. And then the third is actually in the digital asset space. We actually are coming out and we've been in a beta mode with a solution that's geared towards providing traditional banks who want to offer digital wallets to their clients as well as vast who need really stronger Anti Financial Crime solutions with specific solutions that are geared towards the digital asset ecosystem. And we plan to launch that more fully this quarter, which we also see as just a big growth runway for us in addition to fintech. So I would have to say, if anything, it's there's so many great avenues for growth, and these avenues are long-term in nature, in terms of the growth opportunity that we are very excited to continue the momentum of their Verafin business. The product is superb and I think it's proving itself out really well.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Ann, you mentioned some inflationary pressures being felt you noted those are short term. Just wondering if you could speak about those pressures in a bit more detail, is that entirely going to be felt in wages? Are there other areas to note? And looking forward to 2023, I guess, why are you comfortable that this 2% increase is more of a one-off item? And then lastly, sorry for the multipart question, if you're seeing more of the modest inflation on the expense side, are there any opportunities where we could pass along some of those inflationary pressures and take more price on the top-line side? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Ann is going to go ahead on the cost side.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So on the cost side, so we talked about the incremental 2% within the expenses, maybe 1.5%, we see that as being inflationary pressure. Most of that is on the wage side. I do think there's some inflationary pressure across our supplier contracts, which we'll manage through. But the vast majority is on the wage side. And as we think about managing through that, our ultimate goal here is attracting and retaining the best talent to continue to support the long-term growth of the business. And so while we see the pressure right now here being short term in nature, we expect to continue to invest over the long term against those needs.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I think it's important to recognize it's hard to know what the world can be like in 2023. But in 2022 right now, we're frankly managing our talent really well. I think our attrition has stayed very consistent to our historical expectations. But at the same time, it is a tight labor market we want to compete for the best talent. We have amazing talent in Nasdaq that we want to retain and reward. So I think that as we look at 2022, in terms of the labor market right now, I think we feel good about that increase that we mentioned to be able to manage through that situation. It's hard for us to know what 2023 might come \u2013 might hold for that. I think in terms of the revenue side, we do make price increases, CPI adjustments to our prices, and we do that during certain periods of time during the year. We did some adjustments like that going into 2022. But we also tend to take \u2013 number one, we have a lot of long-term contracts that really don't lend themselves to year-over-year price increases. And secondly, we take a long-term view of our clients. We really want to make sure that we're managing to a long-term relationship that they're getting value for every dollar they're spending. And so, we do some CPI adjustments, but we generally try to manage our prices based on incremental value that we're providing to them.\nKyle Voigt: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning, folks.\nAnn Dennison: Good morning.\nBrian Bedell: Good morning. Just, back to the topic of the day, the Amazon Web Services partnership and another question on that, how are you thinking about the scalability of that migration over time? I realize it's still very early. But in terms of the impact on Nasdaq expense base, maybe first of all, can you frame out what sort of the build might the components of the build in the 2022 guidance might be? And then how should we think about the ability of this partnership to you either reduce the long-term expense growth of Nasdaq or become more scalable? And then longer term, do you view this partnership as more of a revenue opportunity or more of a cost reduction opportunity for Nasdaq?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, so I think the good news is that we've been working over the last five years with AWS to move a lot of our surrounding systems around the markets into the AWS cloud, which has actually accrued greatly to our benefit over the last five years because, for instance, just with these record volumes we're experiencing, the surrounding systems, which are like trade management solutions all of the things that happened right after the trade, we have hyper scalability of our solutions today that otherwise we would have had to buy hardware to support. So that's been a real benefit to us and allows for us to have both scalability for our clients, but also definitely a moderation in terms of our CapEx expenses. I think as we go forward, a few things, we also have spent the last five years building out our next-generation trade life cycle solution to be a cloud-ready, cloud-native solution. So, we are deploying that. We deployed that for our BX Options market in 2020. We're now deploying that for MRX in 2022. We're also deploying that for our derivatives markets in the Nordics right at the beginning of 2022, and in fact, in the next month or so. And we're deploying that out to our Market Tech clients in terms of our clearing solutions and our trading solutions. So, we have already been making the investments that we've needed to make to make sure that we are building out our solutions to support an AWS environment. Now it's really the partnership with Equinix and AWS, where they're going to be making their investments in our infrastructure to make it so that we can execute against what we've been discussing. So, we see this as very much part of our 3% to 6% expense growth really factors in the investments we have been making and will continue to make in this area. So that also \u2013 in terms of once we get to scale and we have fully deployed, everything is fully deployed, we do have the opportunity to look at lower CapEx expenses, more scalability in our expense base. But also, I think, that the bigger opportunity for us is in the revenue side because we have a bigger footprint in order to support our clients here in the U.S. and we have the ability to deploy this very differently to our clients around the world. So that to us is definitely the bigger opportunity in the long run.\nBrian Bedell: That's very comprehensive. And three- to five-year period is what you would describe as the long run?\nAdena Friedman: I think that we actually look at this as these things always happen in slower motion than you think. So, we have six options markets in the U.S. and three equities markets in the U.S. And so, we're starting with one. As I said, we'll gain some experience before we set a time line for the rest. And as we deal with our market tech clients, those implementations especially when you're changing out infrastructure, you're looking at probably a two-year to three-year type of implementation once we've actually come to an agreement. So, this is more like, I would say, five to seven years, but I think that's the better time line to consider.\nBrian Bedell: Got it. Thank you so much. Great color.\nAdena Friedman: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to the Nasdaq Datalink. You mentioned the new Data Fabric offering. I guess just a bigger picture question here is how do you see the data link offering evolving over the next couple of years? I guess, what's your vision for that looking out five years? And maybe talk about what's on your to-do list in terms of next steps as you look out to 2022?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, I mean I think that one of the things we hear from our investment management clients is their biggest challenge is managing their data. They are dealing with all of this data, both the traditional financial data that they've always had, but then alternative data and other new data points that they think that might be relevant to making investment decisions or managing their portfolio risk.  So, what Data Fabric does is we \u2013 Datalink in general is there as a container for alternative data as well as financial data, our traditional market data, other exchanges data, et cetera, to kind of make it so it's really, really easy to implement, and it's a cloud-based solution that is really ultra-light in terms of for clients to be able to access the data. Then with Data Fabric, what does is almost create a data management layer for our clients so they can put their own data, their own research into the same platform and make it so that it's all there in one container available to investment professionals, to the traders, to the research analysts and it creates a little bit of order out of the chaos that they're dealing with right now in terms of managing the data. So, that's the vision or that's what we've built. In terms of implementation and the five-year plan, I mean, I think that, obviously, the cloud is there to support more and more real-time workflows. The cloud is there to be able to offer you much better ability to create analytics off that data, to do machine learning algorithms on the back of the data and that's where, I think, over the next five years, we need to continue to enable our clients to leverage the benefits of the cloud as well as kind of the order and the capabilities that we can supplement the data with. So that's our view, Mike, but that's a longer-term view as to how we help our clients manage through this.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you very much. Well, thank you so much for your time today. In closing, Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance was solid, and we are starting off 2022 with really strong momentum. Our leadership team remains very focused on executing our strategy to deliver for all of our stakeholders. And we look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on the progress that we make as we continue to advance our strategic priorities and ambitions. So, thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let me first note how proud I am of the resilience of Nasdaq's business, the nimbleness and dedication of our global team and the trusted relationships we have with our clients. We are certainly familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be as we continue to navigate a dynamic pandemic and economic landscape. Before I turn to our performance, I would briefly like to address the current market environment. While the markets have experienced increased levels of volatility since the start of the year, we maintain a positive overall economic outlook going into 2022 as the underlying economy continues to have the ingredients for continued growth. Notably, consumer demand for products and services remains high. The ongoing digital transformation of industry continues to drive long-term demand for advanced software and other technology and market innovations. And the resulting employment environment is very strong. That said, there are several factors driving the current market volatility. Notably, due to the cyclical and structural issues we are entering 2022 with a tight labor market and supply chain challenges, both of which are contributing to inflationary pressures. Those pressures are then creating uncertainty around the pace and rate of monetary policy adjustments. Additionally, there are broader geopolitical challenges and continued pandemic impacts that are adding to the macro uncertainty. So, while our overall outlook remains positive, we expect the confluence of market-driven factors, and macroeconomic and political factors to continue to drive volatility over the near term. Within that context, we also remain confident in the strength and resilience of our business. For example, we've seen significantly higher trading volumes and within the last week, the industry processed and Nasdaq processed a new record number of messages in a single trading day. We continue to have a healthy pipeline of companies expecting to tap the public markets during 2022. In fact, we have more than double the number of S1s on file with the SEC compared to the prior year period, although market volatility could cause some delays to IPO, timing, something we are monitoring closely. And in our index business, we expect index asset values to experience some impact associated with various market levels and investor appetite for products tracking our indexes, but also the benefit from higher futures trading volume due to the use of our core indexes in market hedging strategies. The diversification of our business over the past number of years has created a flywheel effect between our foundational U.S. and European marketplaces and the technology solutions we deliver to thousands of clients across public companies, investment managers, and banks, as well as the 100 plus market infrastructure operators, all of whom rely on our mission critical software to navigate the financial system successfully. This is especially the case during these periods of heightened market turbulence. We help asset owners rebalance their portfolios and manage asset allocation decisions. We enable banks and brokers to prevent financial crime while handling increased investor activity. We provide critical investor relations insights to corporate clients to understand changes in their investor base. And we empower exchanges around the world to handle the market volumes and volatility. Nasdaq is there as a critical partner across the financial markets and our business has demonstrated time and again, that we can achieve success in the face of these types of backdrops. I'm confident this time will be no different. Let's now turn to our results. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's full year 2021 and fourth quarter 2021 financial and business performance; the progress we've made to drive Nasdaq forward along our strategic direction; and an update on Nasdaq's cloud journey; as well as our ambitions for 2022 and beyond. I'll then turn the call over to Ann who will provide further details about our results, as well as give updates on our guidance, capital deployment and sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A. Let's begin with our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2021. First, on the fourth quarter, we achieved $885 million in net revenues, a 12% increase compared to the prior year period, while non-GAAP earnings per share of a $1.93 rose 21% compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. For the full year of 2021 net revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from the prior year. We achieved 14% organic growth with double digit contributions from both the Solutions segments and Market Services. Our annualized recurring revenue or ARR ended the year at $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% year-over-year. This underscores our continued progress across key secular growth opportunities, including building out our Anti Financial Crime Technology, as well as our analytics and workflow solutions for asset owners. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we see some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 representing a 34% \u2013 I'm sorry, representing 34% of total company, ARR, sorry, up from 28% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The 43% year-over-year increase in annualized SaaS revenues primarily reflects the inclusion of Verafin, as well as strong organic growth in our markets surveillance and investment analytics businesses. Because of our 2021 performance, we entered 2022 with solid momentum and we intend to lean into our success as we operate our advanced client-led technology solutions and our foundational marketplace businesses diligently in the months ahead. Now I'm going to turn to specific highlights of our businesses focusing mainly on fourth quarter results. Our Solutions segments businesses delivered combined total revenues of $581 million during the fourth quarter and 19% increase from the prior year period, driven notably by standout performances from index and listing services, exciting momentum in our investment analytics offerings and strong performance in our Anti Financial Crime offerings, including the impact of the acquisition of Verafin.  In our investment intelligence segment, we delivered $288 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, 18% increase from the prior year period with contributions from across the business. We continue to invest in product innovation to meet the evolving needs of our clients.  During the quarter, we brought to the market several new products that are seeing encouraging initial demand. Let me highlight a few. Data Fabric, which is our new, enhanced, cloud-based offering is a powerful new feature inside of Nasdaq's Data Link that allows clients to bring their own data to the platform and have it securely managed as a service. The early traction we observed with Data Fabric is encouraging and this offering is quickly becoming a critical part of our clients' investment workflows. And in our Index franchise, we saw demand growth for the new offerings in our expanded Nasdaq-100 related and ESG focused indexes, including two new sustainability focused ETFs tracking the Nasdaq-100 ESG and the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 ESG indexes. In total 61 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes launched in 2021, accumulating $2.9 billion in assets through the end of the fourth quarter. Notably, 67% of ETF launches in the year were outside the U.S., demonstrating the strong international demand for Nasdaq's index franchise. Turning to investment analytics building upon our successful partnerships with leading investment consultants that were announced during 2021 Nasdaq's Asset Owner Solutions now distributes investment research and insights from Mercer and Aon among others to our growing community of asset owners and asset managers on the investment platform. This is just one of several ways we're increasing the value of investment and the broader asset owner solutions offering to our clients. And I'm incredibly pleased to see the tremendous sales growth from new clients reported by eVestment and Solovis for the full year of 2021. Combined new sales in 2021 totaled $26 million, an increase of 41% over the prior year, driven in large part by 79% new sales growth in the Asset Owner business. And Solovis' new sales grew 145% across all applying groups. Turning next to our Market Technology segment, we delivered $131 million in total net revenues in the fourth quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results. More broadly, we saw continued growth and demand for our SaaS-based offerings. Both fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions, which we call FRAML and from the market and trade surveillance areas of our Anti Financial Crime Technology, as well as a growing number of market operators, utilizing our cloud native marketplace solutions. Over the course of 2021 I'm pleased to report that in addition to 197 new banks, credit unions and FinTech companies that adopted Verafin, our other market technology businesses welcomed to 31 new customers of which 26 chose our SaaS solutions. Though Market Technology overall had a transformational year in 2021, in particular, as we grow Nasdaq into an Anti Financial Crime leader with related shifts in revenue composition, we have an equal focus on catalyzing of recovery in the growth of our Solutions business for our market infrastructure operators. Revenues recognized in that business decreased in the fourth quarter, on a year-over-year basis, due to factors including lower nonrecurring professional services revenue caused in part by pandemic-related logistical challenge that we've previously disclosed. However, we're seeing some encouraging trends that bring us incrementally closer to a positive inflection in revenue. First, we're making progress on some of the larger, more complex implementations that have been more exposed to the pandemic-related challenges of travel and restrictions to onsite collaboration. In particular, two key projects are approaching their first go live and acceptance phases in the first quarter of 2022. And in a third, the collaboration with the client resulted in its scope and timeline adjusted to reflect both expanding customer needs, balanced against evolving delivery timeline realities. Second, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we achieved strong new order intake of $142 million, capping a record full year of $378 million, excluding Verafin, which constitutes a very substantial 58% increase in new order intake from 2020 that was highly impacted by the onset of the pandemic. Further, we have seen a substantial uptick in early-stage discussions with clients who want to learn more about our progress bringing the benefits of the cloud and managed services to their own markets. We are excited to see how that can play out not only in driving further growth in new contracts down the line, but also because SaaS and managed service projects entail simpler delivery processes versus our legacy on-premises installations. Obviously the duration of the pandemic has exceeded everyone's expectations. However, we are encouraged by the growing interest in our next gen capabilities and the future opportunities to increase the way we serve market infrastructure operators to compliment the strong growth that we see today in our larger Anti Financial Crime offerings. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our market services segment delivered net revenues of $303 million during the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 5% from the prior year period. We maintained our strong competitive performance amid a dynamic trading backdrop as the retail and institutional investment communities found new opportunities across equities and options to drive their strategies. Our U.S. options business set a new annual record for trading volumes in 2021. And we are starting 2022 with new records being set in volumes and message traffic. In early December we, announced our decision to begin the migration of our options markets to the cloud beginning in 2022, starting with our Nasdaq MRX Options market. This innovation in the infrastructure that underpins our markets will create more elasticity in our capacity while maintaining or improving the performance of our clients that our clients have come to expect from us. This will make \u2013 this will be made possible with the build out of the broader cloud infrastructure within the Carteret data center supported by AWS and our local partner Equinix. I will cover this topic in more details in few minutes. Turning to U.S. cash equities, the increase of our volumes as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 mirrored the industry volume increase at approximately 3%. And in the Nordic markets, we continue to experience strong trading performance, including a matched equity market share among lit venues of over 75%. The European equities value traded per day also increased 23% in the fourth quarter versus the prior year. Finally, our Corporate Platforms segment delivered net revenues of $162 million in the fourth quarter, a 17% increase driven primarily by our continued leadership and new listings across our U.S. and European markets, as well as growth and demand for our complimentary IR and ESG services. For the ninth consecutive year, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs in 2021 with 752, capitalizing on one of the strongest years for new issuances over the last two decades. And with a 73% overall IPO win rate. Nasdaq also ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raise for the third quarter with \u2013 I'm sorry for the third year. So let me read that again, Nasdaq also ranked number one in the U.S. in terms of IPO capital raised for the third year, with $181 billion and listed nine of the top 10 U.S. based IPOs in terms of proceeds raise. We also had 33 new companies switched their corporate listings to Nasdaq in 2021, including Honeywell, Palo Alto Networks and Baker Hughes, representing an aggregate of $361 billion in global equity market capitalization. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq in the last decade has exceeded $1.7 trillion. In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also experienced a record year for new listings with 207 companies raising over $15 billion. And for the first time ever Nasdaq Stockholm facilitated more capital raised than any other country in the EU, while our combined Nordic exchanges had more IPOs than any other market operator in Europe. Demand for our IR intelligence and governance solutions drove 4% year-over-year revenue growth for the fourth quarter within the IR and ESG business. We continue to see deepened client engagement across Nasdaq IR Insight and Advisory, and have also invested in the expansion of our ESG advisory and reporting services to corporate clients. We now provide those services in our portfolio solutions offered to companies who list on our U.S. market. Next I'd like to provide an update on the important progress we made in 2021 to advance our cloud journey and how these milestones support our broader strategic vision to unlock potential growth \u2013 growth potential, sorry and accelerate our transition to a SaaS business model in our technology data and investment analytics businesses. Our move to the cloud began over a decade ago. And we have used its innovation capabilities to deliver client-driven solutions while evolving our own infrastructure for digital future. In fact, a wide range of Nasdaq solutions are already in the cloud today. We've also advanced our market's ecosystem by migrating several of our market surrounding systems that have greatly benefited from the hyper scaling that the cloud affords us to manage elevated volumes in the world's markets. We were therefore very excited to announce in December a multi-year partnership with Amazon Web Services to build the next generation of cloud enabled infrastructure for the world's capital markets, committing to move one of our markets to the cloud this year. The partnership with AWS will accelerate the migration of our North American markets to the cloud through a phased approach. Specifically this year, we plan to move our MRX Options market to our generation trading technology and as part of that migration, we also plan to move MRX into AWS's cloud environment within the Carteret data center. The new edge computing solution that we co-designed with AWS may also be used by other market infrastructure operators and market participants to move their trading systems to the cloud. And we look forward to engaging with our market technology clients on this future-oriented approach to managing market infrastructure. In addition, the partnership will include opportunities to explore new ways to leverage AWS's cloud capabilities across Nasdaq's Anti Financial Crime, data and investment analytics, as well as our market infrastructure software businesses. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks today, Nasdaq made notable progress against our broader strategic journey in 2021. As we continue that path, we would like to share our core ambitions and execution priorities for 2022 and beyond which we detail on Page 10 of the presentation. First, we want to reinforce a culture of inclusive, frozen prosperity within our own organization. We want to continue increasing collaboration across our entire enterprise to deliver more through our deep client relationships. To further increase our value proposition as an employer, and to continue to advance our sustainability practices. Second, we want to advance our client-first approach to serving the financial ecosystem. We will continue to deliver our core marketplace solutions with superior client service, utmost integrity, and technological excellence. We will also continue to listen to our client's need as we expand our offerings in index, investment analytics, Anti Financial Crime and ESG solutions. Third, we are accelerating our technology modernization, our AWS partnership and how our marching forward on the cloud is an incredible example of this. But we have additional opportunities to increasingly leverage machine learning within our offerings, as well as our agile development within more of our innovation areas. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these ambitions, in the quarters to come. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2021 for our company. We remain relentlessly focused on a advancing our strategic position as a technology company that is advancing the financial system as we move forward into 2022 capitalizing on the strong momentum generated last year. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details. Hey, Rich. Well, first of all, Rich, we welcome all of your questions. So thank you for that, and thanks for the mention on AWS. But Ann is going to go ahead and give you some color on that. Yes. And I think 1 other just piece of color on the order intake for the year, when we look at it, well more than 50% of the order intake is from either expansions of our relationships with existing clients or from new clients. So it's a net new revenue opportunity for us as we execute against these contracts. I agree. That's a great thing. Thank you. Thanks. Okay. Great. Thanks, Alex. So first of all we continue to support our medium-term, long-term outlook on our Solutions segment revenues in terms of the outlook that we provided to you around that 6% to 9%. I think that all of the businesses have slightly different dynamics. But the one thing I would agree with you on is that the entry rate for those businesses is quite strong. So we had a really strong end to 2021. And then, of course, with ARR, annual recurring revenue, it kind of portends to a strong entry rate for 2022. But as we look at kind of the longer \u2013 medium- to long-term trends of the business, we continue to support that 6% to 9%. And as we continue to perform and execute and grow and expand the businesses, like we did when we announced the Verafin deal, we will certainly make the appropriate adjustments there. But I think, Alex, that as you know, it's always \u2013 it's a very dynamic environment. So we feel very comfortable with that outlook, and we will see how we execute against it this year. Yes. You actually pointed out a lot of key contributors, Dan. So capture is really \u2013 is definitely mix plays a big role in that. The types of \u2013 the types of instruments that are also more heavily traded in any given period of time, and then both also deliberate actions that we might want to take in order to attract certain volumes into our markets from a competitive perspective. So as you know, with more retail, particularly in options just to point out, and more \u2013 and heavier volumes in what I would call the price time markets in options during turbulent times, those venues carry with them a lower capture. Whereas in our Philex and our ISC marketplaces that have support more complex transactions have a higher capture. So any time where you see more retail and more volumes coming in to the price time venues you're going to see capture change. But then at the same time, we do try to manage our capture quite actively in terms of attracting certain order flow into our market stand. So that's a \u2013 there's a lot of dynamics underpinning that. But what we look at is the mix of capture and market share and volumes to try to make sure we're optimizing the results for our shareholders. And I think we've done an excellent job of that, really maintaining, I think a really strong marketplace across all of our businesses, all of our markets in a highly competitive time for the marketplace. Sure. Thanks, Owen. So yes, our AWS partnership actually, I think is really unique because there are a few things. First of all, we do have a lot of our technology services today that are already cloud-based in AWS and also in Azure. And so we have already have, I think a lot of experience in working in the cloud. So as we start to really focus in on the marketplace businesses, and we start to bring our markets into the cloud environment. I think we're doing it in a really, really thoughtful way. But what's really cool and I think cook and unique about the relationship that we've developed here is that bringing AWS into the Carteret data center. And then Equinix has committed to expanding the data center very significantly. We're doubling size of the data center, doubling the power into the data center. So as we create this kind of \u2013 this best private local zone for AWS in Carteret, number one, it makes it much easier for our clients to migrate to the cloud environment that they're going to create inside the data center. And number two, it gives us more space, more power to offer additional services to our clients and to give our clients a chance actually to bring more of their surrounding systems, more of their trading systems into a cloud environment, but in a very controlled way. So it gives us expansion opportunities within Carteret and ways to expand our client relationships there. And then with the go-to-market plans that we have with AWS with our market technology clients around the world, this private local zone construct and the ultra-low latency edge compute system that we co-designed with them we can then deploy that to other major markets around the world and help them with their cloud journeys. And that gives us a chance to be more of a, number one, to deploy our cloud-based marketplace solutions, which we also are implementing for MRX. And then number two, to become more of a managed service provider to our Market Tech clients, which then builds a bigger relationship with them that accrues to our benefit. So a lot of revenue opportunity there in the coming years. I just want to say, those are all long-term, kind of think about the data center, for instance, it's going to take a couple of years to build out the data center. It will take some time for us to deploy our cloud solutions to our Market Tech clients. But we see a really nice medium-to-long-term journey that we can have with AWS on that. In terms of our own markets and moving our markets, we are starting with MRX in 2022, we want to gain some experience with it. We want to hear from our clients as we manage the migration and complete it. And then we will set a more of a targeted time line for how we'll continue the migration of our markets in the U.S. But I want to say we want to start with the first one before we commit to a very specific schedule for the rest. Sure. Yes. So first of all, the order intake numbers that we provide still do not include Verafin. So it only includes our trade and market surveillance business, in addition to the market infrastructure operator business. And I just want to say that the majority of the \u2013 I would say, the large majority of order intake is related to our market infrastructure operator clients because of the fact that they tend to be longer-term contracts. Our trade and market surveillance contracts tend to be shorter in duration and smaller in size. So I think that you should assume that the large majority of ARR is related to market infrastructure operators. Ann you're saying $20 million or 10%? So about $20 million of the order intake is related to our market and trade surveillance business. Just to give you a sense of the size. In terms of \u2013 as we look into 2022, I think it's important to note a few things. Ann mentioned the fact that in the latter half of last year, we had a long-standing client who has \u2013 will continue to license our software, but it was always planned that they would come off our service and maintenance agreement, which is a recurring revenue part of the contract. So that happened in the second half of last year. I think in the third quarter, we announced that. That has to flow through the full year. So that will impact the first half of 2022. Then we also have two of our larger implementations going live with their first phase in the first half of 2022, which obviously gets us then into a different and a stronger revenue mode with them going into the latter half of 2022. And then we have this big set of new order intake that we took in during 2021. And that will take a while for that to flow into the revenue as we complete the implementations of that. So you should assume that you're going to see more momentum as we go through the year of 2022 and digest that order intake as well as turn some of our clients into production clients and get through that full year impact from that one contract. So I think you'll assume \u2013 you just see more momentum going through the latter half of the year. Good morning. Well, I mean, we continue to see massive opportunity for the Verafin organization in three areas. One is as you mentioned, moving up to the larger banks. And we are \u2013 we have signed some really great clients getting into some of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. And we actually have several POCs running with some of the largest banks as they're looking at our fraud solutions and really trying to evaluate that. So those sales cycles are longer, but obviously, the contracts are bigger. So we definitely see a lot of momentum there. The second is, as we look at global expansion and going into Europe, we do have one client that's fully live and working with us. And we're building out a pipeline now to help support more clients in Europe and making sure our solutions are geared towards the European landscape. And so that's an area of focus for us, but that \u2013 if that door opens well and we execute well there, that's just a huge growth area for us over the long term. And then the third is actually in the digital asset space. We actually are coming out and we've been in a beta mode with a solution that's geared towards providing traditional banks who want to offer digital wallets to their clients as well as vast who need really stronger Anti Financial Crime solutions with specific solutions that are geared towards the digital asset ecosystem. And we plan to launch that more fully this quarter, which we also see as just a big growth runway for us in addition to fintech. So I would have to say, if anything, it's there's so many great avenues for growth, and these avenues are long-term in nature, in terms of the growth opportunity that we are very excited to continue the momentum of their Verafin business. The product is superb and I think it's proving itself out really well. Thank you. Ann is going to go ahead on the cost side. Yes. I think it's important to recognize it's hard to know what the world can be like in 2023. But in 2022 right now, we're frankly managing our talent really well. I think our attrition has stayed very consistent to our historical expectations. But at the same time, it is a tight labor market we want to compete for the best talent. We have amazing talent in Nasdaq that we want to retain and reward. So I think that as we look at 2022, in terms of the labor market right now, I think we feel good about that increase that we mentioned to be able to manage through that situation. It's hard for us to know what 2023 might come \u2013 might hold for that. I think in terms of the revenue side, we do make price increases, CPI adjustments to our prices, and we do that during certain periods of time during the year. We did some adjustments like that going into 2022. But we also tend to take \u2013 number one, we have a lot of long-term contracts that really don't lend themselves to year-over-year price increases. And secondly, we take a long-term view of our clients. We really want to make sure that we're managing to a long-term relationship that they're getting value for every dollar they're spending. And so, we do some CPI adjustments, but we generally try to manage our prices based on incremental value that we're providing to them. Sure. Yes, so I think the good news is that we've been working over the last five years with AWS to move a lot of our surrounding systems around the markets into the AWS cloud, which has actually accrued greatly to our benefit over the last five years because, for instance, just with these record volumes we're experiencing, the surrounding systems, which are like trade management solutions all of the things that happened right after the trade, we have hyper scalability of our solutions today that otherwise we would have had to buy hardware to support. So that's been a real benefit to us and allows for us to have both scalability for our clients, but also definitely a moderation in terms of our CapEx expenses. I think as we go forward, a few things, we also have spent the last five years building out our next-generation trade life cycle solution to be a cloud-ready, cloud-native solution. So, we are deploying that. We deployed that for our BX Options market in 2020. We're now deploying that for MRX in 2022. We're also deploying that for our derivatives markets in the Nordics right at the beginning of 2022, and in fact, in the next month or so. And we're deploying that out to our Market Tech clients in terms of our clearing solutions and our trading solutions. So, we have already been making the investments that we've needed to make to make sure that we are building out our solutions to support an AWS environment. Now it's really the partnership with Equinix and AWS, where they're going to be making their investments in our infrastructure to make it so that we can execute against what we've been discussing. So, we see this as very much part of our 3% to 6% expense growth really factors in the investments we have been making and will continue to make in this area. So that also \u2013 in terms of once we get to scale and we have fully deployed, everything is fully deployed, we do have the opportunity to look at lower CapEx expenses, more scalability in our expense base. But also, I think, that the bigger opportunity for us is in the revenue side because we have a bigger footprint in order to support our clients here in the U.S. and we have the ability to deploy this very differently to our clients around the world. So that to us is definitely the bigger opportunity in the long run. I think that we actually look at this as these things always happen in slower motion than you think. So, we have six options markets in the U.S. and three equities markets in the U.S. And so, we're starting with one. As I said, we'll gain some experience before we set a time line for the rest. And as we deal with our market tech clients, those implementations especially when you're changing out infrastructure, you're looking at probably a two-year to three-year type of implementation once we've actually come to an agreement. So, this is more like, I would say, five to seven years, but I think that's the better time line to consider. Okay, thank you. Sure. Yes, I mean I think that one of the things we hear from our investment management clients is their biggest challenge is managing their data. They are dealing with all of this data, both the traditional financial data that they've always had, but then alternative data and other new data points that they think that might be relevant to making investment decisions or managing their portfolio risk.  So, what Data Fabric does is we \u2013 Datalink in general is there as a container for alternative data as well as financial data, our traditional market data, other exchanges data, et cetera, to kind of make it so it's really, really easy to implement, and it's a cloud-based solution that is really ultra-light in terms of for clients to be able to access the data. Then with Data Fabric, what does is almost create a data management layer for our clients so they can put their own data, their own research into the same platform and make it so that it's all there in one container available to investment professionals, to the traders, to the research analysts and it creates a little bit of order out of the chaos that they're dealing with right now in terms of managing the data. So, that's the vision or that's what we've built. In terms of implementation and the five-year plan, I mean, I think that, obviously, the cloud is there to support more and more real-time workflows. The cloud is there to be able to offer you much better ability to create analytics off that data, to do machine learning algorithms on the back of the data and that's where, I think, over the next five years, we need to continue to enable our clients to leverage the benefits of the cloud as well as kind of the order and the capabilities that we can supplement the data with. So that's our view, Mike, but that's a longer-term view as to how we help our clients manage through this. Thank you. Great. Thank you very much. Well, thank you so much for your time today. In closing, Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance was solid, and we are starting off 2022 with really strong momentum. Our leadership team remains very focused on executing our strategy to deliver for all of our stakeholders. And we look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on the progress that we make as we continue to advance our strategic priorities and ambitions. So, thank you very much, and have a great day."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our investor relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter performance beginning on Slide 12 of the presentation. The 12% increase in reported net revenue of $885 million is the net result of organic growth of 10%, including 12% organic increase in the solution segments and a 6% organic increase in market services. And the contribution from Verafin as well as is the impact from divestitures partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 18% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 51% increased three percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $328 million or $1.93 per diluted share compared to $268 million or $1.60 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 13, as Adena mentioned earlier, annualized recurring revenue or ARR totaled $1.87 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $640 million, an increase of 43%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 9% year-over-year. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 14 through 17. Starting with market technology, revenue increased $25 million or 24%. The increase reflects the positive $35 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and the $3 million increase in our existing Anti Financial Crime Technology business, partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $10 million in our market infrastructure technology business. Excluding a $4 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 30% year-over-year; and Anti Financial Crime Technology would have been $76 million with both our existing Surveillance and Verafin's FRAML Solutions continuing to exhibit strong momentum. On a sequential basis and excluding the impact of the purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue, Verafin revenues of $39 million in the fourth quarter compares to $36 million in the third quarter. As we discussed last quarter, the revenue decline within the Market Infrastructure Technology business was impacted primarily by the successful completion of mid-year of a significant long-term maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology as well as decrease more broadly in change requests and installation revenues mostly due to capacity constraints we are working through as a result of logistical implications of the pandemic. That said, as Adena discussed a few minutes ago, we see some encouraging signs, including the $142 million of order intake during the quarter. ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of 51% compared to the prior year. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period, an increase compared to the prior year quarter primarily due to a $25 million reserve related to an unexpected loss on an implementation project taken in the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $4 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $43 million or 18%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $44 million. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business as well as a meaningful contribution from analytics. ARR was $567 million, an increase of 10% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 18% compared to the prior year period to $424 billion, including $74 billion from net inflows and an $83 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $92 billion in net negative impact related to the ETP sponsor switches that we have discussed earlier in 2021. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% is down 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. One note looking forward to the first quarter of 2022. Trading activity of instruments licensed to our Indexes achieved certain annual thresholds mid-year that resulted in an increase in licensing economics in the second half of the year. Similar to what we described in the call one-year ago, as we begin 2022, the economics of certain agreements reset for the New Year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $7 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $23 million or 17%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 23% expansion in our listed corporate issuer base, primarily due to a higher number of IPOs as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and newer ESG and reporting offerings. Corporate Platforms ARR was $546 million and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 37% increased 7 percentage points compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by the continued increase in the listed issuer base. Market Services net revenues increased $15 million or 5%. The organic revenue increase was $17 million or 6%, and there was a $2 million negative impact from changes in tax rates. The organic increase primarily reflects higher equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 61% was unchanged from the prior year period. Turning to Page 18 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $430 million; the increase reflects a $6 million or 1% organic increase and a $24 million increase from the net impact of the acquisition and divestitures, partially offset by a $2 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Excluding the $25 million reserve in the Market Technology segment taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, the organic expense increase totaled 8%. The organic expense increase has two main drivers: first, higher compensation expense, reflecting our continued investment to drive growth as well as an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, marketing and advertising expense driven by higher level of new listing activity. We are initiating our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.68 billion to $1.76 billion. The expense guidance range at the midpoint has three components. First, a core increase compared to 2021 at approximately the mid-point of our medium-term expense growth objective of 3% to 6%. The majority of which is being allocated to our highest growth product areas: Anti Fin Crime, Index, Analytics and ESG. Second is a roughly 2% additional increase, reflecting certain shorter-term factors including costs related to the heightened competition for talent in today's market, and inflationary pressures as well as some budgeted rebounding costs associated with return to office and travel and entertainment. Third, there is also the full year impact of the 2021 M&A activity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, which together net to a decrease of under 1%. Our expense philosophy and budget is driven by our strong growth opportunities and our willingness to invest to properly support execution against them. And as Adena went over earlier in her remarks, our positioning versus these large and growing opportunities has never been better. We expect the 2022 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 19. Debt decreased by $97 million versus 3Q 2021, primarily due to a net payment of $60 million of commercial paper and a $39 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1 times, down from 3.2 times in the third quarter of 2021. Let me take a moment now to update you on stock repurchases. During the fourth quarter of 2021, in addition to retiring 0.4 million shares of stock representing the final 20% of the $475 million accelerated share repurchase program or ASR agreement, we entered into in July of 2021, the company also repurchased an additional $58 million in shares in 4Q 2021. Moving to the first quarter of 2022, thus far in January we have repurchased $142 million in stock. And later this week, we plan to execute a second ASR for $325 million, which we expect to fully complete in the first quarter of 2022. These repurchase plans are consistent with our desire as part of our capital plan to maintain a stable share count and with our intention to materially offset the dilutive impacts of the NFI divestiture beyond the first 12 months of that transaction closing. Turning to Slide 20, I want to touch on Nasdaq's unique set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact and the strong momentum we have in executing against them. In terms of what makes our ESG opportunities unique, we're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders. But we have also positioned ourselves to deliver high impact outside the organization through our Anti Fin Crime Solutions and ESG products and services, our position as a marketplace operator to advance standards and practices and our efforts to further financial inclusion through focused charitable activities and volunteerism. As we look back at 2021, we have made significant progress across all pillars of ESG. We meaningfully expanded our disclosures and commitments, including our first-ever task force on climate-related financial disclosures report; we enhanced our suppliers' sustainability program, received SEC approval on our Board diversity rule and added Puro Earth, a provider of carbon removal solutions to our growing suite of ESG product offerings. We are pleased to see several third-party ESG research and ratings firms recognize our meaningful progress over the year, including Sustainalytics, ISS, CDP, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, the Human Rights Equality Index and the just capital ranking of 100 companies to provide critical business \u2013 who prioritize critical business behaviors. We're also moving further in 2022. Earlier this month, Nasdaq announced its partnership with TRIBE Freedom Foundation, a charity focused on fighting human trafficking and modern slavery. Nasdaq will support TRIBE in the creation of a survivor financial empowerment program, a centralized portal including content, practical tools and educational financial literacy material tailored to support survivors of human trafficking. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure. So thanks for the question, Rich. We did \u2013 we were flat in ARR for Market Tech overall and so there's a couple of different pieces to it. What I would say is we saw growth in the Anti Financial Crime portion of ARR and some \u2013 a slight decline in the market infrastructure technology piece of ARR as we had a contract that was \u2013 there was a duplicate contract that we were serving a client in transition that rolled off. So a minor thing there. What we're also seeing, when you see the revenue growth in the Market Technology business, a lot of that growth is \u2013 in this quarter is coming from additional change requests and the seasonal type items we see in the fourth quarter. Those things don't contribute to ARR but I will want to just point on the positive side that we had a very strong order intake quarter in the fourth quarter and also a record order intake number for the year in marketplace infrastructure attack. And so when you think about the future, while we won't see that coming into ARR right away because there's an implementation phase in many of those projects, we will see the benefits in ARR over time. $20 million. Sure. So on the cost side, so we talked about the incremental 2% within the expenses, maybe 1.5%, we see that as being inflationary pressure. Most of that is on the wage side. I do think there's some inflationary pressure across our supplier contracts, which we'll manage through. But the vast majority is on the wage side. And as we think about managing through that, our ultimate goal here is attracting and retaining the best talent to continue to support the long-term growth of the business. And so while we see the pressure right now here being short term in nature, we expect to continue to invest over the long term against those needs. Good morning."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Ed Ditmire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq\u2019s third quarter 2021 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq\u2019s third quarter 2021 performance, the progress we are making on our strategic repositioning and updates on areas where we are making significant investments to address large opportunities. I will also share brief remarks about the current operating environment before I turn the call over to Ann, who will provide further details about our results as well as an update on our guidance, our capital deployment and our corporate sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A. Let me begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team\u2019s dedication to our broader mission as we made notable progress in the third quarter. Their hard work has been critical to our success in delivering strong results for our clients. Together, we will continue our journey to become the leading provider of technology, data analytics, insights and marketplace excellence to the global capital markets and beyond. Now, turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2021, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $838 million, an increase of $123 million or 17% from the prior year period. Our growth was largely driven by 13% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment, 14% organic growth in our Market Services business and contributions from our acquisition of Verafin. We continue to make notable progress across key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by total company annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, of $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year period. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we are seeing some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Specifically, anti-financial crime technology is showing particularly strong results with revenues increasing 16%, excluding the impact of Verafin. Verafin will begin to be included in our organic growth calculations next year and we saw an increase of over 30% versus prior year in that business. Additionally, in our investment intelligence business, our SaaS products, including the Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions, which is the new name for the combined eVestment and Solovis products, drove the 13% increase in analytics revenue. Our third quarter results underscore the continued progress we have made to advance our strategy and additionally, demonstrate that the value capture from the flywheel effect, which is our ability to leverage the momentum in one business area to drive success in other parts of the business. For example, our success in attracting the majority of the quarter\u2019s new listings and capital raised to Nasdaq drives higher growth in equities and options trading and multiplies cross-sell opportunities for our Investor Relations and ESG-related services. It also contributes to the vitality of the R Index business, like the Nasdaq-100 and the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 indexes and enhances the brand\u2019s strength in other strategic growth areas of the company. As we continue to evolve Nasdaq into a high-performance technology company, each quarter that passes gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made. A critical pillar of our success has been our ability to allocate capital towards our technology and analytics capabilities. Our acquisition of Verafin has established us as a leader in anti-financial crime technology as we build upon our already strong foundation in that area of the market. In the third quarter, our legacy trade surveillance segment saw the largest quarterly order intake in the last several years, adding new business across all regions. While our market surveillance group signed two new clients for our SaaS-based solutions, including a new crypto exchange client. Another pillar has been our ability to advance our leading corporate and marketplace positions. Corporate Platforms\u2019 revenues increased 18% versus the prior year period, driven primarily by outstanding growth in the Nasdaq-listed issuer base across our U.S. and Nordic markets. It has been a record year so far for new listings in the Nordics and with over 132 new listings coming to Nasdaq year-to-date. Additionally, the U.S. has experienced the best new issuance here in the past two decades. And Nasdaq continues to demonstrate strength with a 75% win rate for IPOs in the quarter and a 72% win rate year-to-date. As our listed issuer base grows, we are seeing correlated demand for our suite of IR and ESG services. Within ESG specifically, we see continued interest in our Nasdaq OneReport and our ESG Advisory Solutions coming from very \u2013 from companies at every stage of their ESG journey, including companies preparing to list on Nasdaq. I would like to acknowledge briefly here that we are pleased with the SEC\u2019s approval during the quarter of our proposal to enhance board diversity disclosures. While there have been meaningful developments to advance board diversity across the governance ecosystem, we believe the standardized manner by which Nasdaq listed companies will disclose this information will be critical to driving further progress. We look forward to working with our listed companies to implement the new listing rules. Market Services is another area of our business, where we are seeing that flywheel-related success. Our expanded issuer base benefits equity trading since our share of trading and average capture rate is significantly higher in Nasdaq-listed stocks than it is in stocks listed on other venues. An expanded ecosystem of equity trading in turn brings positive impacts to the options industry, where Nasdaq led all exchanges in the third quarter and the U.S. Equity Options contracts traded. We are also excited by the early progress we are seeing in the growing suite of ESG-related capital market solutions within Market Services. These include the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, our European green bond listing service, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro.earth, as well as the expansion of our Nordic ESG derivatives offering. Overall, our Market Services segment saw revenues increase 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. And this was largely driven by increases in equity derivatives and cash equity net revenues, although all sub-segments of Market Services delivered year-over-year increases. Our Investment Intelligence business saw revenues increase 30% during the third quarter compared to the prior year period. I am sorry our Investment Intelligence businesses saw revenues increased 15% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This was driven by a combination of geographic expansion in our market data business, higher assets under management and exchange traded products linked to the Nasdaq indexes as well as strong new sales, higher client retention and take-up of new capabilities across the analytics offerings. Our Index business continued its strong 2021 performance in the third quarter, with revenues up 38% compared versus the prior year on a combination of both strong market performance of our most important thematic indexes as well as very material net inflows. We are especially pleased to see positive responses from the market to some of our newer products in our Index franchise, with notable AUM growth in the Invesco innovation suite, the new Moray ETF tracking, the PHLX Semiconductor Index and the Hashdex products linked to the Nasdaq Crypto Index. More broadly, AUM and Nasdaq-licensed ETPs launched since 2019 reached $13 billion at the end of the third quarter. We are also unlocking new areas of innovation in our analytics business to bring more data and transparency to the institutional marketplace. This includes a significant partnership announced in July with Mercer, a leading consultant for institutional asset owners that gives our asset owner clients broader access to high-quality research on investment managers and their various investment strategies through a simplified workflow, enabling deeper due diligence. We expect this partnership to expand our clients\u2019 usage of our asset owner solutions going forward. While we continue our strategic journey, I would like to highlight next how we are measuring our progress in evolving the company at the highest level using two key metrics. First, our year-to-date organic revenue growth across the Solutions segments continues to meet or exceed the medium-term outlook of 6% to 9% annualized growth that we initiated after adding Verafin. Our 2021 year-to-date organic growth across the Solutions segment is 15%. Secondly, because we are growing our SaaS revenues even more quickly than the 19% increase in ARR year-over-year, the total percentage of ARR that we are generating from our SaaS businesses rose to 34% at the end of the third quarter. This is up from 28% in the prior year period and continues to move us closer to our medium-term objective of 40% to 50% by 2025. We are very pleased with the progress that our teams continue to make regarding SaaS contributions to our revenues both organically and inorganically. Here are two brief examples that demonstrate our progress and innovation to support this growth. It has been 8 months since we completed the acquisition of Verafin and our collaboration to-date affirms our belief that this combination can accelerate new opportunities. This is particularly the case with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and those international banks from outside of Verafin\u2019s traditional customer franchise in North America. The Verafin team is executing on its strategy to further penetrate Tier 2 banks, which we define as banks holding total assets of $50 billion. And we secured another significant win during the quarter through our joint efforts. While we still have significant developments in progress to unlock broader adoption among new customer groups, our early milestones certainly validate the potential that we have identified together. Additionally, we continue to evolve our cloud-based data offerings with the launch of the Nasdaq Data Link in September. This new platform includes a comprehensive suite of core data covering financial markets, investment fund information and alternative data to every segment of the investment landscape. It\u2019s the perfect illustration of our SaaS evolution in a key growth area at Nasdaq and it underscores our ability to give clients an efficient means to consume and manage market-related datasets in the cloud, which is becoming a standard practice for many users. Initial interest in Nasdaq Data Link is encouraging. The platform has seen daily average of 3,000 new visitors and 200 new account activations in the weeks following the launch. Next, I will briefly address areas of our business, where factors impacting the current operating landscape are particularly relevant today and in the near-term. By and large, we continue to operate within the confines of the pandemic. While there has been slow progress to enable in-person activities and on-site client visits, it remains far from the environment in which we operated prior to March of 2020. We are however fortunate that our diversified business model allows us to be executing at a very high level across our operations despite the prolonged backdrop of the pandemic. The logistical challenges of COVID-19 to travel, intense collaboration and onsite installation and integration, have had their highest impact on the market infrastructure technology business within our Market Technology segment. We have had several complex clearing and post-trade implementation projects that have experienced longer timelines and have required more resources to progress. These challenges have slowed revenue recognition and have increased near-term implementation expenses, impacting near-term margins and creating short-term capacity constraints despite growing demand from clients. The second half of 2021 continues to be heavily impacted by this dynamic. And with this business having relatively high revenue visibility and clear capacity constraints, we know now that in the near-term, market infrastructure technology revenue growth within the broader Market Technology segment will continue to be impacted in 2022 even if the underlying logistical challenges of the pandemic improve. On the other hand, in our Corporate Platforms business, the pandemic period has created some efficiencies on to the go-public process. Notably, IPO roadshows have turned virtual making them more efficient for companies and investors. The new efficiencies have contributed to investors\u2019 ability to evaluate the multitude of new issuers and have increased bankers\u2019 capacity to support companies going through the IPO process. As of today, the pipeline for new listings remains robust based on the number of active S-1 registrations on file with the SEC. Assuming current market conditions persist, we have a strong visibility into the upcoming 6 months and we anticipate this momentum to continue as we enter the final months of the year and into at least the first quarter of 2022. Turning to how we envision our ability to sustain sizable growth in the long-term, I see two key elements to our potential future \u2013 sorry, our future potential. First, we have evolved Nasdaq\u2019s businesses to focus on critical capabilities that are strategically important to our clients and we have become more client-centric than ever. This evolution has allowed us to focus on providing the right data, insights and technology that our clients need to be successful across the capital markets today and tomorrow. Second, we have strong competitive positions in very sizable markets with \u2013 in the key areas of growth for Nasdaq. It is a combined serviceable addressable market of $20 billion across our anti-financial crime and trade surveillance technologies, our indexes and investment analytics solutions as well as our Investor Relations governance and ESG services. Based on our traction in these growth businesses today, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are entering the final months of 2021 with remarkable momentum as we make steady and consistent progress across our key growth areas and our foundational marketplace businesses. Combined with the favorable capital markets and macroeconomic backdrop, we remain well-positioned to advance our strategy into \u201822 \u2013 in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review the financial results in greater detail.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 17% increase in reported net revenue of $838 million is the net result of organic growth of 13%, including 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment and a 14% organic increase in Market Services and the contribution from Verafin as well as the impact from divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 20%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2021 was $303 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $620 million, an increase of 42%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 10% year-over-year. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16. Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $28 million or 33%. The increase reflects the positive $29 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and a $5 million increase in our existing anti-financial crime technology business partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $6 million in our market infrastructure technology business. Excluding a $3 million FX impact as well as the $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the third quarter period and anti-financial crime technology would have been $73 million, with both our existing surveillance and Verafin\u2019s FRAML Solutions continuing to exhibit strong momentum. The revenue decline within the market infrastructure technology business was driven primarily by the planned roll-off of a sizable maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology under our license agreement as well as a decrease more broadly in change request and installation revenues, a consequence of both its strong comparison period in the third quarter of 2020 and capacity constraints we are working through due to logistical implications of the pandemic. ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 9% in the period. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $7 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 14%. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $36 million or 15%, all of which was organic. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our Index business as well as a meaningful contribution from Analytics. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $555 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 15% compared to the prior year period to $361 billion, including $53 billion from net inflows and an $87 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by a $92 billion negative impact related to the previously discussed ETP sponsor switches. These switches collectively were associated with about a $3 million in run rate quarterly revenues, which will be fully reflected in our revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $24 million or 18%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. Listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of our Investor Relations and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Corporate Platforms ARR was $529 million and increased 17% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Market Services net revenues increased $39 million or 15%. The organic revenue increase was $37 million or 14%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects higher Equity Derivatives, Cash Equities and Trade Management Services revenues. The segment operating margin of 63% increased 3 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on higher trading revenues. One modeling item to note is that for the fourth quarter of 2021 and January \u201822, we have waived the collection of certain regulatory fees for four of our U.S. Equity Options markets. This is in order to ensure that collection of the fees, in combination with other regulatory fees and fines, does not exceed our regulatory costs. Holding all else equal, the removal of the fee is expected to reduce our reported capture rate by approximately $0.015 per contract in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $0.005 per contract in the first quarter of 2022. Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $51 million to $397 million. The increase reflects a $26 million or 8% organic increase, a $21 million increase from the net impact of acquisition and divestitures as well as a $4 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. The organic expense increase has two main drivers: first, higher compensation expense reflecting our continued investment to drive growth and an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. Consistent with what we said last quarter about expenses coming in near the high end of the range if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.605 billion to $1.62 billion from $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion previously. The updated range reflects the impact of strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first 9 months of 2021 on variable expenses. Turning to Slide 18, debt increased by $226 million versus 2Q \u201821, primarily due to net issuances of $259 million of commercial paper, primarily used to fund the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, and a net increase of $19 million of Eurobonds from refinancing our 2023 Eurobond with a 2033 Eurobond during the quarter. This is partially offset by a $52 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, unchanged from the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $90 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $475 million, including the initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares of common stock related to the ASR agreement we entered into in July. We expect to receive the remaining shares related to the ASR in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for additional planned repurchases related to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business to resume in 2022. As of September 30, 2021, there was $984 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization, we continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of Nasdaq Fixed Income to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. Turning to Slide 19, I want to begin regularly addressing our focus on ESG elements of our business, both internally and externally, because we believe Nasdaq has an important set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact, and we have a strong momentum in executing against them. We\u2019re committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders, but also have positioned ourselves to develop high impact outside of the organization through our anti-fincrime solutions, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro, and our unique ESG products and services offer to our corporate clients as well as our efforts to further our corporate purpose through focused philanthropy and volunteerism. Our purpose is to champion inclusive growth and prosperity, and we have chosen to emphasize financial literacy and extensive entrepreneurship education and support within underserved communities throughout the U.S. During 2021, we\u2019ve expanded our ESG disclosures with new climate reporting and task force on climate-related financial commitments. Additionally, we have substantially expanded our anti-financial crime and ESG products and services capabilities. And we\u2019ve received FCC approval for our listing rule, promoting increased transparency on board diversity. We have much to do to continue executing on our ESG opportunities, but we were very encouraged to see Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG research and ratings, recently recognized our progress in these areas. Our latest Sustainalytics ESG risk rating improved to a level that puts Nasdaq in the top 3 percentile of all rated companies. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Good morning, Adena and good morning Ann, and congrats on the strong results here.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Rich.\nRich Repetto: I guess you\u2019re having tremendous success with the annual growth of annual recurring revenues and the mix of SaaS revenues in there. And you did talk about \u2013 you said you focused on the critical capabilities of your clients and more client set. So the question is, looking back, how important is equity trading and equity market share even though, again, your revenues there are growing because volumes have grown. But looking \u2013 an old metric was equity market share and revenue capture, how important is that to Nasdaq as you make this transformation?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I would say every part of our business is important, Rich, and important to us. And so we do look at \u2013 we examine every element of our business. Our core marketplace business really serves as our foundation for our ability to serve our clients in a lot of other ways. So we\u2019re extremely focused on it. I think that we\u2019ve seen some shifts in market share as well as just in a couple of different dynamics. One has been the increase in retail, which has increased internalization and just \u2013 and decreased overall exchange\u2019s share of trading. And I think that within that, that\u2019s an area that obviously we\u2019re seeing some more work done by the regulators just to understand that dynamic. I think that the second is, of course, the launch of some new exchanges that have come forward. And they have actually primarily focused on gathering some of that retail order flow and trying to compete for it. So we have really taken a very balanced approach in terms of being strategic in how we serve our clients. We want to make sure that we provide kind of a sustainable marketplace, that we do things in a competitive way, but also creates a sustainable advantage for our markets and for our clients that operate in our markets. And so we\u2019ve taken, I would say, a very measured and balanced approach to managing share, managing capture and evaluating kind of the composition of trading in the markets to make sure that we\u2019re kind of balanced there. And that I would say that applies to both our equities and options markets and how we\u2019re looking at our share and capture and the dynamics there.\nRich Repetto: Okay. And then \u2013 thanks, Adena. And then the one follow-up would be on Market Tech, you certainly explained the quarter-over-quarter decline and the pandemic impact. Could you give more color on sort of the pipeline and how long do you think this impact \u2013 I guess if you could forecast that or just color going forward in the current \u2013 if the environment stayed roughly the same, I guess?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. Well, first of all, I do think the environment is starting to generally improve in terms of being able to travel a bit now. But we\u2019re still doing most of our client interactions on Zoom, and that makes it harder. It\u2019s also harder to develop the kind of what I would call the top end of the pipeline, the top end of the funnel in terms of identifying new clients. But I do think we\u2019ve done a good job of adapting there to try to make sure that we know which new marketplaces are starting to consider launching and how we can serve them. So you\u2019re seeing that we are still signing up new clients, for sure. They are taking our SaaS-based marketplace solutions, which we\u2019re also pretty excited about. I think more than 90% of our new clients, any new clients that\u2019s signing up for us across all of Market Tech, and that includes Market Infrastructure Technology clients as well as anti-fin crime. Actually, it\u2019s well more than 90% are taking our SaaS-based solutions, and that includes new markets launching in the cloud and taking our next-gen trading system. So we see a good pipeline, I would say, Rich. And we also see that we could do more, and we definitely want to be able to identify client opportunities a little earlier and travel will help with that. But I also would say that on the post-trade side, which is where we\u2019ve really experienced most of our delivery challenges, those are harder to implement. They take \u2013 they are multiyear programs. They always have been. But they are definitely lengthening out in time with our inability to be on site. We are starting to get on site now with some of our clients, and that\u2019s helping, definitely helping to accelerate things. And I also think that it\u2019s keeping us from being able to meet all the demands that our clients have. So we do see good strong client demand there, but we have to make sure that we have the resources to be able to meet the demand. So we\u2019ve been working with our clients to kind of stage that over time. And that\u2019s what I think is going to is what we really were referring to in our comments around 2021 and 2022 is just that we see the need for us to manage through those capacity constraints before we can really meet all the demands that our clients have.\nRich Repettos: Got it and congrats on the continued transformation, Adena. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks a lot, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up on the Market Tech component and just thinking, I think you mentioned some increased costs around some of the implementations as well. So the longer term kind of margin opportunity within this business, has that changed at all or is that also just kind of part of the temporary revenue slowdown more of a factor than necessarily cost on a go-forward basis?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I think that there are two metrics that we\u2019ve provided to our investor base to kind of measure our progress in the business. One is just our overall medium to long-term growth outlook on revenues and then the other is this notion of the rule of 40, which is really a combination of the growth in the revenues and the EBITDA margin of the business. And so what our outlook is, is that we expect to be able to deliver 13% to 16% annualized growth over the coming 3 to 5-year period across Market Technology. And that includes the Market Infrastructure Technology business and the anti-financial crime business together. And we do continue to believe that, that is an appropriate expectation of growth for the business going forward. I think that the \u2013 on the rule of 40, what we\u2019ve communicated is that we wanted to get to a rule of 40, which is, as I said, the combination of growth in EBITDA by 2023, and we continue to see ourselves on track for that. So you have to think about this as a shorter term or at least a near-term challenge that we\u2019re having to work our way through that part of the business that is most impacted to be able to get ourselves to a better growth state and more scalability as we sign more of our clients to SaaS clients instead of on-prem clients.\nDan Fannon: Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then as a follow-up on the index business, just to clarify, the switches that has not yet to impact the revenue for \u2013 as we think about the fourth quarter. And could you maybe talk about the difference in the fees associated with what\u2019s coming in, in terms of net inflows? I think you gave a stat around inflows since, I think, 2019. Maybe discuss kind of the different kind of fee thresholds as we think about the AUM mix.\nAnn Dennison: So Dan, on your first question, we saw about half \u2013 roughly half of the impact around the switches coming in the third quarter. And we will see the full run rate in the fourth quarter.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And on the second part of your question, the fee base for the switches that we experienced particularly, one of them was very low. And so therefore, that $3 million impact was \u2013 is a low revenue impact against the AUM that was switched. I think going \u2013 with regard to the new products we are launching, the fees that we are able to attract with regard to kind of what some of our innovative products like the Nasdaq Next Generation 100, the crypto index and the semiconductor indexes are to me more in line with our normal \u2013 our kind of historical norms. So they do carry a higher fee base than the AUM that we lost.\nDan Fannon: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question about your partnership with Sporttrade and the sports betting industry overall. Could you please talk about maybe the potential market size such as how many similar sports betting companies out there that you can provide your surveillance technology? And then broadly speaking, could you please talk about your recent traction in the non-financial space? It looks like we haven\u2019t talked about this for a while. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Great. Hi, Owen. So, on Sporttrade, there is a combination of what we are doing there. One is we have taken an investment in the business itself through our venture portfolio. And then we also are providing them the surveillance technology. And what\u2019s interesting about Sporttrade and the market model that they are creating is they are definitely creating more what I would call like a marketplace model where they are going to have market makers, they are going to have a bit of spreads for different in-game betting opportunities. And it\u2019s going to be really an interesting market model. Our surveillance technology absolutely applies to that type of market model. But actually the module that we have created around sports surveillance applies to multiple \u2013 the traditional model as well in terms of having a kind of your own book and then betting against the house kind of thing. So, I think that we can apply the technology to a traditional sports book or to these new marketplaces. And we have created a module that\u2019s specific to that segment. So, we are pretty excited about that. And we don\u2019t have a TAM or a SAM yet. And that\u2019s actually a good question, Owen. So, we will come back and think through how do we look at that SAM developing, particularly for our surveillance and trading technologies for that segment going forward. But it\u2019s obviously very early days here in the U.S. for that. In terms of other new markets and non-financial markets, we are continuing to support the crypto exchanges. I think we have eight exchanges leveraging our trading technology, nine leveraging our surveillance technology today. And then we also are seeing kind of fractionalized markets like fractionalized real estate markets and others coming up. And there are actually several really interesting new marketplaces launching. And they are all coming on to what we are calling our Nasdaq Marketplace Services Platform, which is really a SaaS-based cloud, and it can be delivered in the cloud or we can host it. But it\u2019s a managed service platform where we provide the technology, but also the infrastructure so that markets can spin up a lot faster. So, I would say though, Owen as you know, this is an early part of our strategy and but we are definitely seeing nice progress. And we can provide you some more stats going forward on kind of new markets that we are launching there.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then could you please also explain a little bit more on how Nasdaq Data Link can expand, what you have in Quandl? Is it related to like integrating the data in Quandl and provide clients with a more holistic view of data from different sources? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: You actually hit the nail on the head. So, we think about Quandl now is like one component of Nasdaq Data Link. The Quandl Data, like the alternative data that we provide to investment managers are integrated into Nasdaq Data Link. The technology that underpins Quandl is actually the underpinning of Nasdaq Data Link technology. But it also includes our market information. It includes some investment information. Now we are calling Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions data, like on investment management funds and trends there. It actually, you can \u2013 a client could choose to put their own third-party managed data into this system and we can basically become their technology provider to making it to all of their data is managed and available to them in a really, really nice modern API structure. And so it\u2019s really an umbrella way for us to deliver market information, fund information, alternative information in a modern API and cloud-based infrastructure. So, it\u2019s really easy to use, by the way. And it\u2019s really easy to take the data sets and integrate them into Excel or anything else that you want to use internally.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: Good morning everyone. I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the index business. I apologies if I missed it. I am just kind of curious on the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter. Maybe you can give us kind of an updated framework on how it\u2019s breaking down between what\u2019s AUM-driven subscription and transaction?\nAdena Friedman: In terms of the futures versus the AUM?\nChris Allen: Yes.\nAdena Friedman: I think that it\u2019s a good question. So, I don\u2019t know if you have an\u2026\nAnn Dennison: Yes. We usually \u2013 we don\u2019t give the specifics on it. It\u2019s about \u2013 you could think about the assets, the AUM portion being about two-thirds of the index line, and then the rest will include the futures portion.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And in general, though I think what we have been doing now is in our statistics that we send out. We provide you all an update on AUM both in terms of net inflows as well as market appreciation. And as we have said, it\u2019s really been a combination of inflows and market appreciation that have driven up the assets under management. I think it\u2019s 15% for the quarter and then our revenues has been even better than that for the quarter based on a combination of these things.\nChris Allen: And any color on the $12 million sequential increase from 2Q to 3Q in revenues? Just it\u2019s a pretty big number, particularly in \u2013 I know there is \u2013 you had a little bit of the $1.5 million from the switches coming out.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I mean it\u2019s really been \u2013 I would say it\u2019s really largely inflows and market-appreciation driven more so than futures driven for the quarter.\nChris Allen: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Just start off with a question on \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a broader question on crypto, but also anti-financial crime. So, just the question would be \u2013 the broader question is, are you able to measure yet, and I know it\u2019s early days, your contribution from crypto broadly because it does touch a lot of different segments between the index licensing, potentially anti-financial crime mandates and then also, obviously, Market Technology. And then if it\u2019s too early to size that, maybe just give some perspective on how you see that developing across the segments and especially anti-financial crime, whether you are actually seeing mandates that are based on crypto surveillance in that?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. No, it\u2019s a great question. So, I would say it is probably \u2013 it\u2019s a little early. But it\u2019s a good question, so let\u2019s take that back and see whether that\u2019s something we want to start to think about how we communicate to you guys. But you are right, so we have the Crypto Index product that has about, as we mentioned, it\u2019s about $600 million of assets under management there. We have the surveillance and the Market Tech solutions. And so we will come back to you Brian, just to kind of think about how we want to start to provide you more clarity there. But it is early days. And on the surveillance side and actually the broader anti-financial crime side, that\u2019s an area that we are really spending a lot of time on to try to figure out how we can provide broader services across our bank clients as well as our brokerage clients, because right now, the surveillance capabilities is really driven by marketplaces. But over time, as crypto becomes more integrated into the financial system, we want to make sure that we can provide solutions that meet the needs across all of our customers. So, that\u2019s actually an area of active evaluation right now and we are looking at that. It\u2019s a great \u2013 to have 2,000 banks as our clients across the U.S. and Canada really does give us a much broader opportunity to think about how to serve their evolving needs there.\nBrian Bedell: Yes. That sounds like an exciting growth opportunity. And then maybe just switching over to just a question on market structure. Obviously, with the new administration, we are not so new now. But with talk about different views on working on market structure, especially payment for order flow. And I guess what\u2019s your view on \u2013 if you have a view on what you think would be a good solution to that. Obviously, we have talked about sub-$0.01 pricing being allowed on exchanges, if that\u2019s a potential remedy for the order flow situation? And then also any other commentary on Market Data where that stands given that the prior administration had put that rule in place?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So, I think that with regard to the market structure discussions, and I think the SEC\u2019s paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So, I think what we were happy about with that report, well, a few things. One, they did a really nice job of dissecting the activity and understanding that there wasn\u2019t anything there that that had, I would say, that there was nothing there that really signified that there is any significant manipulation in the markets. I think the second thing is that they really did note that the markets were really resilient and very efficient. And that obviously is a good thing for us. But they also did point out a few key areas of focus. One is the quality of the national best offer. And the fact that so much more of the activity is happening in the dark, is there an impact on the quality of the national investment offer. And that\u2019s an area that we have been doing some work on. I think our Chief Economist published a report on that last week. And that then ties to what are the incentive structures that underpin the markets. And so are we finding that order flow is being moved off exchange and brought into these darker venues because of incentive structures. And I think I don\u2019t think that the SEC necessarily drew a definitive conclusion there, but it\u2019s an area that I think that they will be focused on. All we can say is we really believe in taking kind of iterative, smaller steps, iterative change rather than big bang changes to market structure because it\u2019s such an intricately woven system that it\u2019s really \u2013 the law of unintended consequences are high. But if they look at disclosures around PFA or they look at making some measured changes to the PFA structure as well as making it so we can compete more for order flow like sub-$0.01 pricing or other rules that encourage orders to come on to exchange and be lit. I think that those are all things that would be positive for us. But recognizing that we like innovation, we like variety and competition. We think that those are all good for investors. And so we have to make sure we are taking measured steps there. And I got the sense that they weren\u2019t looking at draconian steps and that they were going to take a pretty measured approach.\nBrian Bedell: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you around just the thoughts on sort of inflationary pressures we kind of hear in a number of different corners of financial services, but obviously markets broadly, I guess particularly when it comes to technology and technology capital. I know you guys don\u2019t have a 2022 budget yet, but as you are thinking about where your growth focus is and where you are investing and where you sort of make incremental investments, how do you think about that as a potential headwind? What are the sort of things you can do to maybe upset or reengineer it and I guess to some extent? Just curious to get your thoughts on what you are seeing in the marketplace?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. I definitely think that there has been \u2013 I think that we all know that the competition for talent is pretty \u2013 at a pretty heightened level right now. And so we are \u2013 we have honestly benefited from the ability for us to attract talent from all over the world. The benefit is that we have tech talent in the U.S., in Canada, in Europe and Asia and Australia. We have tech talent kind of spread throughout different economies in different markets, which gives us more flexibility to seek out talent in markets where we think that we can do that efficiently. But at the same time, it is a competitive environment. We do think that there is going to be increases in wage in \u2013 I would say, wage increases as we go into 2022. But as you said, we haven\u2019t yet finalized our budget and our planning. So, we will be able to talk more about that on our fourth quarter call as we provide you with our 2022 guidance. But we are evaluating that as part of the needs for us to compete for talent, but also recognize we have some benefits from having such a global workforce.\nAlex Blostein: Alright. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks a lot Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to the Nasdaq Data Link that you were talking about a little earlier, just how might ESG data become a component or captured in the Data Link? And what\u2019s the opportunity more broadly for Nasdaq to become a driver of ESG standards and scoring in the industry? And maybe you could talk a little bit about how you see that developing in the marketplace more broadly?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. Actually, part of Data Link is something called the Nasdaq ESG Data Hub. So, it\u2019s basically information that we have gathered from third-party sources that allow buy-side institutions to get information that they need, whether it\u2019s climate-related information or other structured data that helps them evaluate companies and industries. So, I think that we actually are serving that up very successfully within Data Link. So, that\u2019s one of the modules of battling. But the one thing that we don\u2019t have and what we don\u2019t intend to do is become a rating agency ourselves. That\u2019s just not our role. We are here \u2013 we look at it as we have an ecosystem that includes 4,000 corporate clients. They have a lot of information that they need to be able to provide to investors, and we want to support them in providing that information to investors. We then have thousands of institutional managers that receive our information and we can deliver data to them either through ESG Data Link or through our Nasdaq asset owner solutions where they can gather up information they need to make better informed investment decisions. And that over time, we hope that the data that we are helping our corporate clients collect and distribute can actually be served up through our Nasdaq asset owner solutions and not just to the rating agencies, so that they can also control the information that they are providing to investors. But I think that we are just not in the mode of actually being a rating agency ourselves. I think there are many of them out there right now. We have actually partnered with Sustainalytics to start to develop some index strategies that we think will be really interesting in the space. But that\u2019s kind of the role that we are playing as opposed to trying to be that rating agency ourselves.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, earlier in the call, you reiterated that expectation for the 13% to 16% annual revenue growth range for the Market Tech segment as a whole. But if we just narrow in on the market infrastructure business specifically, it\u2019s a business that has been able to grow quite strongly in the years before the pandemic. I understand there are some near-term challenges, but I am just wondering if your medium term revenue growth expectations for that infrastructure business has changed at all over the last 18 months or whether or not they are \u2013 I guess expectations are relatively similar and we are just trying to get through this kind of near-term headwinds?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I mean I would say our expectations are over the medium term are similar to where we have been. And it\u2019s really just getting ourselves through these the immediate term issues that we are having, kind of managing our way through a more challenging delivery environment. So \u2013 and I think that the client demand is definitely there. Our engagements with our clients are excellent. I think our clients are excited to be able to leverage the next-gen technology we have. And we are delivering that to a lot of our clients. But we just have to work our way through some of these near-term challenges, but the medium term outlook remains the same.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Alright. Well, thank you all very much. I am so happy to have you on the call. We are very pleased to see that our business is continuing to deliver strong organic revenue growth. And as you know, we are really guided by our strategic direction. And we have a clear focus as to how we want to continue to re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. So, thank you all very much. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's third quarter 2021 performance, the progress we are making on our strategic repositioning and updates on areas where we are making significant investments to address large opportunities. I will also share brief remarks about the current operating environment before I turn the call over to Ann, who will provide further details about our results as well as an update on our guidance, our capital deployment and our corporate sustainability efforts before we move to Q&A. Let me begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's dedication to our broader mission as we made notable progress in the third quarter. Their hard work has been critical to our success in delivering strong results for our clients. Together, we will continue our journey to become the leading provider of technology, data analytics, insights and marketplace excellence to the global capital markets and beyond. Now, turning to our financial results for the third quarter of 2021, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $838 million, an increase of $123 million or 17% from the prior year period. Our growth was largely driven by 13% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment, 14% organic growth in our Market Services business and contributions from our acquisition of Verafin. We continue to make notable progress across key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by total company annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, of $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% compared to the prior year period. Within our recurring revenue businesses, we are seeing some of our best performances from our SaaS-based solutions. Specifically, anti-financial crime technology is showing particularly strong results with revenues increasing 16%, excluding the impact of Verafin. Verafin will begin to be included in our organic growth calculations next year and we saw an increase of over 30% versus prior year in that business. Additionally, in our investment intelligence business, our SaaS products, including the Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions, which is the new name for the combined eVestment and Solovis products, drove the 13% increase in analytics revenue. Our third quarter results underscore the continued progress we have made to advance our strategy and additionally, demonstrate that the value capture from the flywheel effect, which is our ability to leverage the momentum in one business area to drive success in other parts of the business. For example, our success in attracting the majority of the quarter's new listings and capital raised to Nasdaq drives higher growth in equities and options trading and multiplies cross-sell opportunities for our Investor Relations and ESG-related services. It also contributes to the vitality of the R Index business, like the Nasdaq-100 and the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 indexes and enhances the brand's strength in other strategic growth areas of the company. As we continue to evolve Nasdaq into a high-performance technology company, each quarter that passes gives us an opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made. A critical pillar of our success has been our ability to allocate capital towards our technology and analytics capabilities. Our acquisition of Verafin has established us as a leader in anti-financial crime technology as we build upon our already strong foundation in that area of the market. In the third quarter, our legacy trade surveillance segment saw the largest quarterly order intake in the last several years, adding new business across all regions. While our market surveillance group signed two new clients for our SaaS-based solutions, including a new crypto exchange client. Another pillar has been our ability to advance our leading corporate and marketplace positions. Corporate Platforms' revenues increased 18% versus the prior year period, driven primarily by outstanding growth in the Nasdaq-listed issuer base across our U.S. and Nordic markets. It has been a record year so far for new listings in the Nordics and with over 132 new listings coming to Nasdaq year-to-date. Additionally, the U.S. has experienced the best new issuance here in the past two decades. And Nasdaq continues to demonstrate strength with a 75% win rate for IPOs in the quarter and a 72% win rate year-to-date. As our listed issuer base grows, we are seeing correlated demand for our suite of IR and ESG services. Within ESG specifically, we see continued interest in our Nasdaq OneReport and our ESG Advisory Solutions coming from very \u2013 from companies at every stage of their ESG journey, including companies preparing to list on Nasdaq. I would like to acknowledge briefly here that we are pleased with the SEC's approval during the quarter of our proposal to enhance board diversity disclosures. While there have been meaningful developments to advance board diversity across the governance ecosystem, we believe the standardized manner by which Nasdaq listed companies will disclose this information will be critical to driving further progress. We look forward to working with our listed companies to implement the new listing rules. Market Services is another area of our business, where we are seeing that flywheel-related success. Our expanded issuer base benefits equity trading since our share of trading and average capture rate is significantly higher in Nasdaq-listed stocks than it is in stocks listed on other venues. An expanded ecosystem of equity trading in turn brings positive impacts to the options industry, where Nasdaq led all exchanges in the third quarter and the U.S. Equity Options contracts traded. We are also excited by the early progress we are seeing in the growing suite of ESG-related capital market solutions within Market Services. These include the Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, our European green bond listing service, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro.earth, as well as the expansion of our Nordic ESG derivatives offering. Overall, our Market Services segment saw revenues increase 15% in the third quarter versus the prior year. And this was largely driven by increases in equity derivatives and cash equity net revenues, although all sub-segments of Market Services delivered year-over-year increases. Our Investment Intelligence business saw revenues increase 30% during the third quarter compared to the prior year period. I am sorry our Investment Intelligence businesses saw revenues increased 15% in the third quarter compared to the prior year period. This was driven by a combination of geographic expansion in our market data business, higher assets under management and exchange traded products linked to the Nasdaq indexes as well as strong new sales, higher client retention and take-up of new capabilities across the analytics offerings. Our Index business continued its strong 2021 performance in the third quarter, with revenues up 38% compared versus the prior year on a combination of both strong market performance of our most important thematic indexes as well as very material net inflows. We are especially pleased to see positive responses from the market to some of our newer products in our Index franchise, with notable AUM growth in the Invesco innovation suite, the new Moray ETF tracking, the PHLX Semiconductor Index and the Hashdex products linked to the Nasdaq Crypto Index. More broadly, AUM and Nasdaq-licensed ETPs launched since 2019 reached $13 billion at the end of the third quarter. We are also unlocking new areas of innovation in our analytics business to bring more data and transparency to the institutional marketplace. This includes a significant partnership announced in July with Mercer, a leading consultant for institutional asset owners that gives our asset owner clients broader access to high-quality research on investment managers and their various investment strategies through a simplified workflow, enabling deeper due diligence. We expect this partnership to expand our clients' usage of our asset owner solutions going forward. While we continue our strategic journey, I would like to highlight next how we are measuring our progress in evolving the company at the highest level using two key metrics. First, our year-to-date organic revenue growth across the Solutions segments continues to meet or exceed the medium-term outlook of 6% to 9% annualized growth that we initiated after adding Verafin. Our 2021 year-to-date organic growth across the Solutions segment is 15%. Secondly, because we are growing our SaaS revenues even more quickly than the 19% increase in ARR year-over-year, the total percentage of ARR that we are generating from our SaaS businesses rose to 34% at the end of the third quarter. This is up from 28% in the prior year period and continues to move us closer to our medium-term objective of 40% to 50% by 2025. We are very pleased with the progress that our teams continue to make regarding SaaS contributions to our revenues both organically and inorganically. Here are two brief examples that demonstrate our progress and innovation to support this growth. It has been 8 months since we completed the acquisition of Verafin and our collaboration to-date affirms our belief that this combination can accelerate new opportunities. This is particularly the case with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and those international banks from outside of Verafin's traditional customer franchise in North America. The Verafin team is executing on its strategy to further penetrate Tier 2 banks, which we define as banks holding total assets of $50 billion. And we secured another significant win during the quarter through our joint efforts. While we still have significant developments in progress to unlock broader adoption among new customer groups, our early milestones certainly validate the potential that we have identified together. Additionally, we continue to evolve our cloud-based data offerings with the launch of the Nasdaq Data Link in September. This new platform includes a comprehensive suite of core data covering financial markets, investment fund information and alternative data to every segment of the investment landscape. It's the perfect illustration of our SaaS evolution in a key growth area at Nasdaq and it underscores our ability to give clients an efficient means to consume and manage market-related datasets in the cloud, which is becoming a standard practice for many users. Initial interest in Nasdaq Data Link is encouraging. The platform has seen daily average of 3,000 new visitors and 200 new account activations in the weeks following the launch. Next, I will briefly address areas of our business, where factors impacting the current operating landscape are particularly relevant today and in the near-term. By and large, we continue to operate within the confines of the pandemic. While there has been slow progress to enable in-person activities and on-site client visits, it remains far from the environment in which we operated prior to March of 2020. We are however fortunate that our diversified business model allows us to be executing at a very high level across our operations despite the prolonged backdrop of the pandemic. The logistical challenges of COVID-19 to travel, intense collaboration and onsite installation and integration, have had their highest impact on the market infrastructure technology business within our Market Technology segment. We have had several complex clearing and post-trade implementation projects that have experienced longer timelines and have required more resources to progress. These challenges have slowed revenue recognition and have increased near-term implementation expenses, impacting near-term margins and creating short-term capacity constraints despite growing demand from clients. The second half of 2021 continues to be heavily impacted by this dynamic. And with this business having relatively high revenue visibility and clear capacity constraints, we know now that in the near-term, market infrastructure technology revenue growth within the broader Market Technology segment will continue to be impacted in 2022 even if the underlying logistical challenges of the pandemic improve. On the other hand, in our Corporate Platforms business, the pandemic period has created some efficiencies on to the go-public process. Notably, IPO roadshows have turned virtual making them more efficient for companies and investors. The new efficiencies have contributed to investors' ability to evaluate the multitude of new issuers and have increased bankers' capacity to support companies going through the IPO process. As of today, the pipeline for new listings remains robust based on the number of active S-1 registrations on file with the SEC. Assuming current market conditions persist, we have a strong visibility into the upcoming 6 months and we anticipate this momentum to continue as we enter the final months of the year and into at least the first quarter of 2022. Turning to how we envision our ability to sustain sizable growth in the long-term, I see two key elements to our potential future \u2013 sorry, our future potential. First, we have evolved Nasdaq's businesses to focus on critical capabilities that are strategically important to our clients and we have become more client-centric than ever. This evolution has allowed us to focus on providing the right data, insights and technology that our clients need to be successful across the capital markets today and tomorrow. Second, we have strong competitive positions in very sizable markets with \u2013 in the key areas of growth for Nasdaq. It is a combined serviceable addressable market of $20 billion across our anti-financial crime and trade surveillance technologies, our indexes and investment analytics solutions as well as our Investor Relations governance and ESG services. Based on our traction in these growth businesses today, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead of us. As I wrap up, I want to reiterate that we are entering the final months of 2021 with remarkable momentum as we make steady and consistent progress across our key growth areas and our foundational marketplace businesses. Combined with the favorable capital markets and macroeconomic backdrop, we remain well-positioned to advance our strategy into \u201822 \u2013 in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review the financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Rich. Well, I would say every part of our business is important, Rich, and important to us. And so we do look at \u2013 we examine every element of our business. Our core marketplace business really serves as our foundation for our ability to serve our clients in a lot of other ways. So we're extremely focused on it. I think that we've seen some shifts in market share as well as just in a couple of different dynamics. One has been the increase in retail, which has increased internalization and just \u2013 and decreased overall exchange's share of trading. And I think that within that, that's an area that obviously we're seeing some more work done by the regulators just to understand that dynamic. I think that the second is, of course, the launch of some new exchanges that have come forward. And they have actually primarily focused on gathering some of that retail order flow and trying to compete for it. So we have really taken a very balanced approach in terms of being strategic in how we serve our clients. We want to make sure that we provide kind of a sustainable marketplace, that we do things in a competitive way, but also creates a sustainable advantage for our markets and for our clients that operate in our markets. And so we've taken, I would say, a very measured and balanced approach to managing share, managing capture and evaluating kind of the composition of trading in the markets to make sure that we're kind of balanced there. And that I would say that applies to both our equities and options markets and how we're looking at our share and capture and the dynamics there. Yes. Well, first of all, I do think the environment is starting to generally improve in terms of being able to travel a bit now. But we're still doing most of our client interactions on Zoom, and that makes it harder. It's also harder to develop the kind of what I would call the top end of the pipeline, the top end of the funnel in terms of identifying new clients. But I do think we've done a good job of adapting there to try to make sure that we know which new marketplaces are starting to consider launching and how we can serve them. So you're seeing that we are still signing up new clients, for sure. They are taking our SaaS-based marketplace solutions, which we're also pretty excited about. I think more than 90% of our new clients, any new clients that's signing up for us across all of Market Tech, and that includes Market Infrastructure Technology clients as well as anti-fin crime. Actually, it's well more than 90% are taking our SaaS-based solutions, and that includes new markets launching in the cloud and taking our next-gen trading system. So we see a good pipeline, I would say, Rich. And we also see that we could do more, and we definitely want to be able to identify client opportunities a little earlier and travel will help with that. But I also would say that on the post-trade side, which is where we've really experienced most of our delivery challenges, those are harder to implement. They take \u2013 they are multiyear programs. They always have been. But they are definitely lengthening out in time with our inability to be on site. We are starting to get on site now with some of our clients, and that's helping, definitely helping to accelerate things. And I also think that it's keeping us from being able to meet all the demands that our clients have. So we do see good strong client demand there, but we have to make sure that we have the resources to be able to meet the demand. So we've been working with our clients to kind of stage that over time. And that's what I think is going to is what we really were referring to in our comments around 2021 and 2022 is just that we see the need for us to manage through those capacity constraints before we can really meet all the demands that our clients have. Thanks a lot, Rich. Sure. I think that there are two metrics that we've provided to our investor base to kind of measure our progress in the business. One is just our overall medium to long-term growth outlook on revenues and then the other is this notion of the rule of 40, which is really a combination of the growth in the revenues and the EBITDA margin of the business. And so what our outlook is, is that we expect to be able to deliver 13% to 16% annualized growth over the coming 3 to 5-year period across Market Technology. And that includes the Market Infrastructure Technology business and the anti-financial crime business together. And we do continue to believe that, that is an appropriate expectation of growth for the business going forward. I think that the \u2013 on the rule of 40, what we've communicated is that we wanted to get to a rule of 40, which is, as I said, the combination of growth in EBITDA by 2023, and we continue to see ourselves on track for that. So you have to think about this as a shorter term or at least a near-term challenge that we're having to work our way through that part of the business that is most impacted to be able to get ourselves to a better growth state and more scalability as we sign more of our clients to SaaS clients instead of on-prem clients. Yes. And on the second part of your question, the fee base for the switches that we experienced particularly, one of them was very low. And so therefore, that $3 million impact was \u2013 is a low revenue impact against the AUM that was switched. I think going \u2013 with regard to the new products we are launching, the fees that we are able to attract with regard to kind of what some of our innovative products like the Nasdaq Next Generation 100, the crypto index and the semiconductor indexes are to me more in line with our normal \u2013 our kind of historical norms. So they do carry a higher fee base than the AUM that we lost. Sure. Great. Hi, Owen. So, on Sporttrade, there is a combination of what we are doing there. One is we have taken an investment in the business itself through our venture portfolio. And then we also are providing them the surveillance technology. And what's interesting about Sporttrade and the market model that they are creating is they are definitely creating more what I would call like a marketplace model where they are going to have market makers, they are going to have a bit of spreads for different in-game betting opportunities. And it's going to be really an interesting market model. Our surveillance technology absolutely applies to that type of market model. But actually the module that we have created around sports surveillance applies to multiple \u2013 the traditional model as well in terms of having a kind of your own book and then betting against the house kind of thing. So, I think that we can apply the technology to a traditional sports book or to these new marketplaces. And we have created a module that's specific to that segment. So, we are pretty excited about that. And we don't have a TAM or a SAM yet. And that's actually a good question, Owen. So, we will come back and think through how do we look at that SAM developing, particularly for our surveillance and trading technologies for that segment going forward. But it's obviously very early days here in the U.S. for that. In terms of other new markets and non-financial markets, we are continuing to support the crypto exchanges. I think we have eight exchanges leveraging our trading technology, nine leveraging our surveillance technology today. And then we also are seeing kind of fractionalized markets like fractionalized real estate markets and others coming up. And there are actually several really interesting new marketplaces launching. And they are all coming on to what we are calling our Nasdaq Marketplace Services Platform, which is really a SaaS-based cloud, and it can be delivered in the cloud or we can host it. But it's a managed service platform where we provide the technology, but also the infrastructure so that markets can spin up a lot faster. So, I would say though, Owen as you know, this is an early part of our strategy and but we are definitely seeing nice progress. And we can provide you some more stats going forward on kind of new markets that we are launching there. You actually hit the nail on the head. So, we think about Quandl now is like one component of Nasdaq Data Link. The Quandl Data, like the alternative data that we provide to investment managers are integrated into Nasdaq Data Link. The technology that underpins Quandl is actually the underpinning of Nasdaq Data Link technology. But it also includes our market information. It includes some investment information. Now we are calling Nasdaq Asset Owner Solutions data, like on investment management funds and trends there. It actually, you can \u2013 a client could choose to put their own third-party managed data into this system and we can basically become their technology provider to making it to all of their data is managed and available to them in a really, really nice modern API structure. And so it's really an umbrella way for us to deliver market information, fund information, alternative information in a modern API and cloud-based infrastructure. So, it's really easy to use, by the way. And it's really easy to take the data sets and integrate them into Excel or anything else that you want to use internally. Thank you. In terms of the futures versus the AUM? I think that it's a good question. So, I don't know if you have an... Yes. And in general, though I think what we have been doing now is in our statistics that we send out. We provide you all an update on AUM both in terms of net inflows as well as market appreciation. And as we have said, it's really been a combination of inflows and market appreciation that have driven up the assets under management. I think it's 15% for the quarter and then our revenues has been even better than that for the quarter based on a combination of these things. Yes. I mean it's really been \u2013 I would say it's really largely inflows and market-appreciation driven more so than futures driven for the quarter. Yes. No, it's a great question. So, I would say it is probably \u2013 it's a little early. But it's a good question, so let's take that back and see whether that's something we want to start to think about how we communicate to you guys. But you are right, so we have the Crypto Index product that has about, as we mentioned, it's about $600 million of assets under management there. We have the surveillance and the Market Tech solutions. And so we will come back to you Brian, just to kind of think about how we want to start to provide you more clarity there. But it is early days. And on the surveillance side and actually the broader anti-financial crime side, that's an area that we are really spending a lot of time on to try to figure out how we can provide broader services across our bank clients as well as our brokerage clients, because right now, the surveillance capabilities is really driven by marketplaces. But over time, as crypto becomes more integrated into the financial system, we want to make sure that we can provide solutions that meet the needs across all of our customers. So, that's actually an area of active evaluation right now and we are looking at that. It's a great \u2013 to have 2,000 banks as our clients across the U.S. and Canada really does give us a much broader opportunity to think about how to serve their evolving needs there. Sure. So, I think that with regard to the market structure discussions, and I think the SEC's paper was, to me, an early first step in a long process of evaluating how to continuously improve the market. So, I think what we were happy about with that report, well, a few things. One, they did a really nice job of dissecting the activity and understanding that there wasn't anything there that that had, I would say, that there was nothing there that really signified that there is any significant manipulation in the markets. I think the second thing is that they really did note that the markets were really resilient and very efficient. And that obviously is a good thing for us. But they also did point out a few key areas of focus. One is the quality of the national best offer. And the fact that so much more of the activity is happening in the dark, is there an impact on the quality of the national investment offer. And that's an area that we have been doing some work on. I think our Chief Economist published a report on that last week. And that then ties to what are the incentive structures that underpin the markets. And so are we finding that order flow is being moved off exchange and brought into these darker venues because of incentive structures. And I think I don't think that the SEC necessarily drew a definitive conclusion there, but it's an area that I think that they will be focused on. All we can say is we really believe in taking kind of iterative, smaller steps, iterative change rather than big bang changes to market structure because it's such an intricately woven system that it's really \u2013 the law of unintended consequences are high. But if they look at disclosures around PFA or they look at making some measured changes to the PFA structure as well as making it so we can compete more for order flow like sub-$0.01 pricing or other rules that encourage orders to come on to exchange and be lit. I think that those are all things that would be positive for us. But recognizing that we like innovation, we like variety and competition. We think that those are all good for investors. And so we have to make sure we are taking measured steps there. And I got the sense that they weren't looking at draconian steps and that they were going to take a pretty measured approach. Sure. Yes. I definitely think that there has been \u2013 I think that we all know that the competition for talent is pretty \u2013 at a pretty heightened level right now. And so we are \u2013 we have honestly benefited from the ability for us to attract talent from all over the world. The benefit is that we have tech talent in the U.S., in Canada, in Europe and Asia and Australia. We have tech talent kind of spread throughout different economies in different markets, which gives us more flexibility to seek out talent in markets where we think that we can do that efficiently. But at the same time, it is a competitive environment. We do think that there is going to be increases in wage in \u2013 I would say, wage increases as we go into 2022. But as you said, we haven't yet finalized our budget and our planning. So, we will be able to talk more about that on our fourth quarter call as we provide you with our 2022 guidance. But we are evaluating that as part of the needs for us to compete for talent, but also recognize we have some benefits from having such a global workforce. Great. Thanks a lot Alex. Yes. Actually, part of Data Link is something called the Nasdaq ESG Data Hub. So, it's basically information that we have gathered from third-party sources that allow buy-side institutions to get information that they need, whether it's climate-related information or other structured data that helps them evaluate companies and industries. So, I think that we actually are serving that up very successfully within Data Link. So, that's one of the modules of battling. But the one thing that we don't have and what we don't intend to do is become a rating agency ourselves. That's just not our role. We are here \u2013 we look at it as we have an ecosystem that includes 4,000 corporate clients. They have a lot of information that they need to be able to provide to investors, and we want to support them in providing that information to investors. We then have thousands of institutional managers that receive our information and we can deliver data to them either through ESG Data Link or through our Nasdaq asset owner solutions where they can gather up information they need to make better informed investment decisions. And that over time, we hope that the data that we are helping our corporate clients collect and distribute can actually be served up through our Nasdaq asset owner solutions and not just to the rating agencies, so that they can also control the information that they are providing to investors. But I think that we are just not in the mode of actually being a rating agency ourselves. I think there are many of them out there right now. We have actually partnered with Sustainalytics to start to develop some index strategies that we think will be really interesting in the space. But that's kind of the role that we are playing as opposed to trying to be that rating agency ourselves. Yes. I mean I would say our expectations are over the medium term are similar to where we have been. And it's really just getting ourselves through these the immediate term issues that we are having, kind of managing our way through a more challenging delivery environment. So \u2013 and I think that the client demand is definitely there. Our engagements with our clients are excellent. I think our clients are excited to be able to leverage the next-gen technology we have. And we are delivering that to a lot of our clients. But we just have to work our way through some of these near-term challenges, but the medium term outlook remains the same. Alright. Well, thank you all very much. I am so happy to have you on the call. We are very pleased to see that our business is continuing to deliver strong organic revenue growth. And as you know, we are really guided by our strategic direction. And we have a clear focus as to how we want to continue to re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. So, thank you all very much. We look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 17% increase in reported net revenue of $838 million is the net result of organic growth of 13%, including 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment and a 14% organic increase in Market Services and the contribution from Verafin as well as the impact from divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 20%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% increased 1 percentage point compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the third quarter of 2021 was $303 million or $1.78 per diluted share compared to $256 million or $1.53 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.834 billion, an increase of 19% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $620 million, an increase of 42%. Excluding the impact of Verafin, ARR increased 10% year-over-year. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16. Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $28 million or 33%. The increase reflects the positive $29 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin and a $5 million increase in our existing anti-financial crime technology business partially offset by an organic revenue decline of $6 million in our market infrastructure technology business. Excluding a $3 million FX impact as well as the $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $39 million in the third quarter period and anti-financial crime technology would have been $73 million, with both our existing surveillance and Verafin's FRAML Solutions continuing to exhibit strong momentum. The revenue decline within the market infrastructure technology business was driven primarily by the planned roll-off of a sizable maintenance and support licensing contract with a customer who will continue to use our technology under our license agreement as well as a decrease more broadly in change request and installation revenues, a consequence of both its strong comparison period in the third quarter of 2020 and capacity constraints we are working through due to logistical implications of the pandemic. ARR for Market Technology was $428 million in the third quarter of 2021, an increase of 54% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 9% in the period. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned $7 million purchase price adjustment related to Verafin, the operating margin would have been 14%. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $36 million or 15%, all of which was organic. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our Index business as well as a meaningful contribution from Analytics. Annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, was $555 million, an increase of 9% compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices rose 15% compared to the prior year period to $361 billion, including $53 billion from net inflows and an $87 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by a $92 billion negative impact related to the previously discussed ETP sponsor switches. These switches collectively were associated with about a $3 million in run rate quarterly revenues, which will be fully reflected in our revenues for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2021. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged compared to the prior year period as we continue to make strategic investments in Index and Analytics to support sustained growth. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $24 million or 18%, reflecting organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. Listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of our Investor Relations and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Corporate Platforms ARR was $529 million and increased 17% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Market Services net revenues increased $39 million or 15%. The organic revenue increase was $37 million or 14%, and there was a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects higher Equity Derivatives, Cash Equities and Trade Management Services revenues. The segment operating margin of 63% increased 3 percentage points from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on higher trading revenues. One modeling item to note is that for the fourth quarter of 2021 and January \u201822, we have waived the collection of certain regulatory fees for four of our U.S. Equity Options markets. This is in order to ensure that collection of the fees, in combination with other regulatory fees and fines, does not exceed our regulatory costs. Holding all else equal, the removal of the fee is expected to reduce our reported capture rate by approximately $0.015 per contract in the fourth quarter of 2021 and approximately $0.005 per contract in the first quarter of 2022. Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $51 million to $397 million. The increase reflects a $26 million or 8% organic increase, a $21 million increase from the net impact of acquisition and divestitures as well as a $4 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar. The organic expense increase has two main drivers: first, higher compensation expense reflecting our continued investment to drive growth and an increase in variable performance-linked compensation due to our outstanding results; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased trading capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. Consistent with what we said last quarter about expenses coming in near the high end of the range if performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.605 billion to $1.62 billion from $1.59 billion to $1.62 billion previously. The updated range reflects the impact of strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first 9 months of 2021 on variable expenses. Turning to Slide 18, debt increased by $226 million versus 2Q \u201821, primarily due to net issuances of $259 million of commercial paper, primarily used to fund the accelerated share repurchase program, or ASR, and a net increase of $19 million of Eurobonds from refinancing our 2023 Eurobond with a 2033 Eurobond during the quarter. This is partially offset by a $52 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.2x, unchanged from the second quarter of 2021. During the third quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $90 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $475 million, including the initial delivery of approximately 2 million shares of common stock related to the ASR agreement we entered into in July. We expect to receive the remaining shares related to the ASR in the fourth quarter of 2021 and for additional planned repurchases related to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business to resume in 2022. As of September 30, 2021, there was $984 million remaining under the share repurchase authorization, we continue to expect EPS dilution from the sale of Nasdaq Fixed Income to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the June 25 close but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. Turning to Slide 19, I want to begin regularly addressing our focus on ESG elements of our business, both internally and externally, because we believe Nasdaq has an important set of opportunities in terms of our sustainability and external impact, and we have a strong momentum in executing against them. We're committed to the highest level of sustainability in terms of how we run our businesses and serve all of our stakeholders, but also have positioned ourselves to develop high impact outside of the organization through our anti-fincrime solutions, our carbon removal marketplace, Puro, and our unique ESG products and services offer to our corporate clients as well as our efforts to further our corporate purpose through focused philanthropy and volunteerism. Our purpose is to champion inclusive growth and prosperity, and we have chosen to emphasize financial literacy and extensive entrepreneurship education and support within underserved communities throughout the U.S. During 2021, we've expanded our ESG disclosures with new climate reporting and task force on climate-related financial commitments. Additionally, we have substantially expanded our anti-financial crime and ESG products and services capabilities. And we've received FCC approval for our listing rule, promoting increased transparency on board diversity. We have much to do to continue executing on our ESG opportunities, but we were very encouraged to see Sustainalytics, a leading provider of ESG research and ratings, recently recognized our progress in these areas. Our latest Sustainalytics ESG risk rating improved to a level that puts Nasdaq in the top 3 percentile of all rated companies. We look forward to updating you on a regular basis as we progress our ESG initiatives going forward. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. So Dan, on your first question, we saw about half \u2013 roughly half of the impact around the switches coming in the third quarter. And we will see the full run rate in the fourth quarter. Yes. We usually \u2013 we don't give the specifics on it. It's about \u2013 you could think about the assets, the AUM portion being about two-thirds of the index line, and then the rest will include the futures portion."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Ditmire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2021 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2021 financial and business performance, as well as the progress we\u2019ve made to drive forward along our strategic direction. I would like to begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's deep commitment and delivering results for our clients, while creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Nasdaq's mission reflects our focus on becoming the premier platform and ecosystem for the global capital markets and beyond with unmatched technology, insights, and markets expertise, and we made important progress during the second quarter. Our financial results demonstrate our business' ability to capture opportunity in a unique economic environment, even as we continue to strengthen its positioning for long-term growth. We see strong demand for many of our products and services as corporate issuers, institutional investors, banks, brokers, and marketplace operators all navigate today's rapidly changing world. Our core foundational marketplaces benefited from an active capital market backdrop, that's all record setting industry U.S. equity and options trading volumes in the first half of 2021. Our client first model has also driven our ability to win the majority of new listings in one of the strongest periods of industry activity in years. Meanwhile, expanding demand from institutional owners for index strategies, as well as asset allocation and portfolio management tools from banks for modern anti-financial crime solutions; and from corporates for ESG and Investor Relations solutions underpinned our performance in the Solutions segment businesses. Our performance in these businesses is also a testament to our client centric approach, and strategically aligned offerings as we invest in and grow new and innovative technology to meet that demand. We also achieved other important milestones against our corporate journey this quarter. First, Nasdaq completed the sale of our U.S. fixed income business to Tradeweb Markets at the end of the second quarter. Second, we announced our strategic investment in Puro.earth, a leading carbon removal marketplace, along with the launch of our new ESG Data Hub these solutions further expand the ways that we can partner with our clients to support their unique sustainability efforts. And third, we announced yesterday that we are starting an exciting next chapter for the Nasdaq private market as part of our partnership with a group of leading banks in the private market space. It highlights both the success of the private market platform we developed at Nasdaq and the growing interest in developing a robust ecosystem for private company liquidity. All of these actions underscore our commitment to our strategy and allow us to reprioritize elements of our unique business model to advance our focus on the most impactful secular opportunities.  I will now turn to our financial results from the second quarter of 2021. Overall, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $846 million, an increase of $147 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 18% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment and 10% organic growth in our Market Services businesses. We continue to execute against key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by strong momentum in our institutional investor analytics and anti-financial crime solutions businesses, as well as the broad-based growth in total company ARR of $1.8 billion. This equated to an increase of 22%, compared to the prior year period, reflecting both the acquisition of Verafin and a 12% increase in our existing ARR. Turning now to specific segment highlights from the second quarter, I\u2019ll begin with our foundational marketplace in corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $312 million. That's 13% increase from the prior year period. Market Services transactional revenues, the sum of our cash equity, equity derivative, and fixed income commodities trading businesses increased by 27% in total, in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year period, with the largest contributor of this being our equity derivatives revenues, where we experienced strong increases in U.S. options industry volume.  Nasdaq's options markets, specifically traded $782 million of multiply listed options contracts, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Driven by an active dynamic equities market we've also seen increased levels of activity from companies seeking to tap the public market to raise capital, which has resulted in a 13% increase in the overall number of operating companies listed on the U.S. on Nasdaq in the last 12 months. Specifically, we have 352 more operating companies listed on Nasdaq in the U.S. than we did in June of 2020. The increase in our number of listed companies naturally contributes to higher industry volumes and contributes to higher trading on Nasdaq in particular, since we have approximately 2 times higher market share in our own listed stocks than we have in stocks listed on other markets. I would also like to highlight for a moment another record breaking Nasdaq Closing Cross during the annual Russell U.S. Indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. The Closing Cross successfully executed 2.3 billion shares of Nasdaq listed securities representing approximately $81 billion in market value, and occurred in under 2 seconds. This Closing Cross was 760 million shares larger than our second largest Closing Cross ever, which occurred in March of this year with the Triple Witch expiration. I'm incredibly proud of our team as this milestone underscores our leadership and operating the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure. Next, our corporate platform segment delivered revenues of $154 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. The business continues to thrive with elevated levels of new listings since the market recovery in the second half of 2020. In our listings business Nasdaq again led U.S. Exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 135 IPOs that raised $31.7 billion, including 88 operating company IPOs, and 47 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges with a 78% total win rate on IPOs, as well as executing the largest direct listing ever, Coinbase. In addition to new listings, we also welcomed 10 switches in the second quarter of 2021, representing a combined $183 billion in market value, including Honeywell, a DOW 30 company. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq since 2016 now exceeds $1 trillion. Meanwhile, our Nordic listing platform hosted 62 IPOs in the second quarter, bringing the total to 86 in the first half of 2021, contributing to an 11% year-over-year increase in the Nordic listed issuer base compared to the prior year quarter. Nasdaq is proud to be the exchange partner supporting companies throughout their corporate lifecycle with our commitment to providing issuers with an industry leading market model and a full suite of investor relations, Board engagement, and ESG solutions. Revenues in our IR and ESG services increased $4 million or 8% to $56 million in the second quarter, compared to the prior year period, as we continue to see strong demand for our Investor Relations and advisory in ESG product offerings. The economic impacts of the pandemic combined with a sudden and likely lasting landscape of virtual or hybrid investor engagement, has increased corporates focus on investor relationship and has accelerated their professionalization of their ESG program, both of which has intensified the demand for new data and tools to power their program. Now, let me take a minute to talk about the actions we've taken to advance the Nasdaq Private Market going forward. This week we announced an agreement to contribute Nasdaq Private Market into a joint venture with Silicon Valley Bank, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. This creates a new entity to build upon NPM\u2019s success becoming the leading marketplace platform for issuer led private company tender transactions. The partnership will enable increased investment in a broader set of capabilities designed to enhance NPM\u2019s position as the go-to marketplace for private company liquidity. Now, their private market will continue to expand from its foundation of facilitating private company tender programs to enhance and refine its buyside book-building, auctions, investor block trades, and pre-direct listing continuous trading program. Additionally, the platform will provide end-to-end settlement and through the new ownership structure will create a unique and powerful distribution network serving private companies and institutional investors. Nasdaq\u2019s Market Technology business will be contracted to supply NPM as technology platform on a go forward basis.  Nasdaq Private Markets talented team has made strong progress in the seven years since we established the business as measured by the close relationships we've built with more than 250 leading private companies worldwide, and the more than $30 billion in transaction volume that they've executed for many of the world's largest private companies. This new entity will expand upon that success going forward. In the last 12 months, ended June 30, revenues for Nasdaq Private Market increased $13 million, or approximately 200% over the prior year period. Going forward with our partners, we expect to unlock significantly more value for our clients and shareholders by advancing the market for private company shares with the high integrity advanced platform that facilitates liquidity in new ways and build on the momentum that we've developed over the past several years. Now, let me turn to our market technology and investment intelligence segments. Our market technology segment delivered $117 million in revenues at 39% increase year-over-year, including a 5% organic increase from our existing business and an additional $27 million contribution from Verafin. Revenues in the second quarter of 2021 also included a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associate with the closing of the Verafin transaction. In our anti-financial crime technology business, revenues increased $29 million or 88%, driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin, as well as the continued growth in surveillance solutions. With Verafin as part of Nasdaq for its first full quarter, we continue to find great opportunities, working collaboratively with the Verafin team to open doors to new clients and expand their footprint. Verafin signed 36 new clients during the second quarter, and we remain extremely pleased with the business and its growth potential as it achieves its mission of fighting financial crime.  In our marketplace infrastructure technology business revenues increased $4 million or 8% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. New order intake for market technology hit a sixth quarter high at $81 million, excluding Verafin. Market technology ARR increased 9% year-over-year also included \u2013 excluding the impact of Verafin. If you include Verafin, Nasdaq market technologies ARR increased 61%. Turning to our investment intelligence segment, we delivered net revenues of $263 million, up $50 million or 23% from the prior year period. Overall assets under management and ETPs benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $415 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year period.  We are pleased to expand our long standing partnership with Invesco during the second quarter with the launch of two new thematics technology ETF tracking the Nasdaq Biotech Index, and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. These two indexes are the longest standing benchmark for their respective sectors and in the past year have increased in relevance for investors given the recent pandemic related events. We also continue to see strong global interest in our index franchise with 12 of 15 new and licensed ETP launches in the second quarter occurring outside of the U.S. We are committed to bringing investment opportunities through our index partnerships and empower investors globally with access to diversified investment opportunities. For example, XP Inc., a technology driven investment management platform Brazil launched one of the first locally listed Nasdaq 100 ETF offerings in Latin America during the second quarter, while Hashdex, also from Brazil, partner with Nasdaq to launch the world's first ETF available in Brazil to investors utilizing the Nasdaq Crypto Index. During the quarter, two ETP sponsors, BlackRock and Vanguard announced that they would be switching and consolidating their relationships with some index providers, and as a consequence, certain of their products would no longer be licensing Nasdaq Indexes. While we're always disappointed to lose sponsors, the loss had a minimal financial impact, which Ann will touch on in her comments. And the continued expansion of our relationships with the broader sponsor universe, as well as the continued innovation and growth of the index product suite gives us great cause for optimism going forward. Turning next to our analytics business, we've delivered revenues of $50 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period due to growth in investment and service revenues from hire new sales and increased retention. Driven in part by the success of the enterprise license contracting initiative, which spread usage of eVestment\u2019s unique analytics to more users in more business areas of our client base. Lastly, revenues in our market data business rose 5%, as compared to the prior year period to $106 million, driven primarily by expanding international demand for proprietary data products. As our business our clients in the broader markets begin to prepare to operate in a post pandemic environment, we're excited to carry forward the strong momentum from the first half of 2021 and into the future. One increased area of focus for us is ESG, which we've seen growing interest from a range of clients in both the U.S. and Europe. Nasdaq\u2019s position at the intersection of financial, corporate, and regulatory communities gives us a unique perspective of on corporate sustainability. From this vantage point, we're actively engaging with clients to help them successfully navigate the complex and fast maturing ESG landscape. We were thrilled to have the opportunity in the second quarter to add Puro.earth, the marketplace for carbon removal solutions to help our corporate clients meet their emission reduction commitments. At the same time, as a public company ourselves, we engage with our employees and our communities to improve our own practices, performance, and transparency on our own ESG journey. In that regard, I encourage our stakeholders to review our recently published and expanded sustainability report, which is available on our website. As a wrap-up, I want to highlight how each of our businesses has expanded the diversity and depth of their client base in recent years, which underpins the strength and resiliency of the Nasdaq platform as you move through each quarter. Our strong engine of talent and technology is allowing us to expand our position in the capital markets in ways that can capitalize on the powerful secular tailwinds in a post pandemic period. We're leading Nasdaq into the second half of 2021 with incredible momentum and I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in detail.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. Before we review the financial comparisons and developments, I want to cover some reporting changes going forward, related specifically to some of the strategic developments within the business portfolio that Adena mentioned previously. First, with regards to the Nasdaq Private Market or NPM, as recently announced we have contributed this business to a newly formed joint venture for which we will own a minority interest. As a result, we will no longer consolidate the results and instead will be recognizing our share of net income as a non-operating item, consistent with how we treat other unconsolidated investees. Second, with regards to both NPM and Nasdaq Fixed Income or NFI, beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we will reclassify the revenue and operating expenses of these two businesses out of the corporate platforms, market services, and investment intelligence segment results for all prior periods and move them into corporate items so that the business results of each of these segments can be compared to prior periods on a like-for-like basis. On Slide 12, we provide a table previewing the reclassified operating segment results. Now, I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance. The 21% increase in reported net revenue of $846 million is a result of organic growth of 15%, including 18% organic increase in the Solutions segments and a 10% organic increase in Market Services, a 4% positive impact from acquisitions, and a 2% positive impact from changes in FX rates. I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments as shown on pages 5 through 8 of the slide presentation. I will start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $50 million or 23%. Organic revenue growth totaled $47 million or 22%. And there was a $3 million positive impact from changes in FX rate. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business, as well as strong contributions from both the analytics and market data businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $547 million, an increase of 11%, compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq\u2019s indices rose 53%, compared to the prior year period to $415 billion, including $47 billion from net inflows and $113 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $17 billion in negative net impact related to an ETP sponsor switching its Index Provider. The investment intelligence segment operating margin of 65% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. As Adena mentioned earlier, we will see an additional impact to AUM in the third quarter of 2021 related to previously announced ETP sponsor index switches. The total revenue impact of all of the 2021 switches announced to date is estimated to be approximately $3 million per quarter. Market Technology revenue increased $33 million or 39%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $4 million or 5%, $27 million from the acquisition of Verafin and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rate. Excluding a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues associated with the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $37 million. The organic revenue increase, which excludes revenue generated from Verafin during the first 12 months after the acquisition close was driven primarily by higher support and licensing revenues and higher SaaS based surveillance solutions revenues. ARR for Market Technology was $432 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 9%, compared to the prior period, excluding the impact of Verafin. Including Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 61% in the period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period. Market Technology expenses include a partial reversal of the reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 of approximately $6 million as we finalize client negotiations and updated our estimate of costs to service our client agreements. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $28 million, or 22%. Organic revenue growth totaled $25 million or 20% and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rate. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base together with an increase in IR advisory services and ESG product offering. Corporate Platforms ARR was $509 million, and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period and that was driven by both the continued increase in the listed issuer base and strong activity on the Nasdaq Private Market. Market Services net revenues increased $36 million or 13%. The organic revenue increase was $28 million or 10% and there was an $8 million impact from changes in FX rates.  The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on trading revenues. Turning to Pages 9 and 10 to review both expenses and 2021 guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $65 million to $392 million. The increase reflects a 24 million or 7% organic increase, a $26 million increase from the impact of acquisitions, as well as a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar.  The organic expense increases two main drivers: First, higher variable performance linked compensation expense, reflecting our outstanding revenue growth; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased training capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of 1.59 billion to 1.62 billion to reflect that our strong and broad based organic revenue growth in the first half of 2021 has impacted variable expenses like performance based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, if the performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we would as we said last quarter, expect to come in near the high-end of this updated expense guidance range.  Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $80 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 1 percentage point, compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense was $33 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $8 million, compared to the prior year period, due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the second quarter of 2021. For full-year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27% and barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2021 was $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to $256 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt decreased by $189 million versus the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a net reduction of $214 million of commercial paper, partially offset by $24 million increase in euro bonds book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio ended the period of 3.2 times, a decrease from 3.4 times in the first quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $88 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $248 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was 1.46 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. As previously communicated, upon the confirmation of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, we issued approximately 6.2 million shares to a third party. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale, as well as available tax benefits working and clearing capital of this business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset the EPS dilution from the sale. This week, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $470 million. Let me talk for a moment about share count expectations. Our average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter were 166 million. Due to timing, this average reflected only a minimal impact of the 6.2 million and a fire-related share issuance. At the end of the second quarter however, diluted shares outstanding were approximately 172 million. With our plan to execute the accelerated share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2021, at the current share price, we would retire approximately 2 million shares in the third quarter, and roughly a half a million additional shares in the fourth quarter. We plan to execute additional repurchases to offset the remaining NFI dilution in 2022 and 2023. We continue to expect EPS solution from the sale of NFI to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the [June 25 close], but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. I'll wrap up by saying that these capital reallocation actions, both in terms of the sale of NFI and the related capital return program support Nasdaq's acceleration of our strategy, and allow the company to further concentrate our resources on strategic opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Good morning, Adena and Ann. First, congrats on the, sort of the sale or spin-out of the Private Markets. So, I guess my question is, can you give us a better feel for the minority interest in, you know what the valuation was, you know, and then a little bit on the background of how it develop? Because you do have some significant players, some others aren't in it. And I'm backing into, I guess, 20 million in revenue, is that right for, sort of, what would contribute fully last year?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks Rich. So, first of all, we are really, really excited about the partnership we've created. And we basically, we contributed the Nasdaq Private Markets asset. The other firms contributed investment dollars, so that we can continue to build out the platform and grow and expand the footprint of Nasdaq Private Market going forward. We have a large minority stake. So, we are the largest shareholder and we will retain that. In terms of the revenue for the last [12 months] (ph), you did the math right. So, it's 20 million for \u2013 on an on an LTM basis. So \u2013 but I would say that, that we are, you know, we do think that this is an opportunity for us to really accelerate our progress in the private company share liquidity programs, and we're seeing a lot of interesting and additional programs or interest from institutional investors from other shareholders to really use the Nasdaq Private Market for price discovery, maybe continuous trading programs and other things like that. And we think that with the partners that we have between the West Coast with Silicon Valley Bank and their relationships with the venture community and early stage private companies, the institutional connections that Citi and Morgan Stanley and Goldman have.  And then us as a marketplace operator and our expertise and our relationships with later stage private companies. It's kind of like this, this great coming together of talent and network and distribution capabilities that we think that we can really, really accelerate the progress and create a lot of value for our shareholders, even with a large minority interest as opposed to 100% interest. So, that is the thesis, and we're really excited to get going with them and it should actually close pretty quickly. We've gotten a lot of approvals, so we should be able to get this going very quickly.\nRich Repetto: Okay. And then the related follow-up would be on Nasdaq Fixed Income. If I'm looking at Slide 12, that means it was about 10 million in revenue or so, can you talk about the profitability of Nasdaq Fixed Income?\nAdena Friedman: So, it's 10 million for market services, and then there's also revenue coming out of the investment intelligence business which is the data part of NFI. So, those two together that make up their revenues that are coming out. In terms of profitability, it was profitable, I mean, it is profitable, but not to the same degree as the rest of our business.\nRich Repetto: Understood, and congrats on moving the strategic pivot forward here.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nAdena Friedman: Hey, Alex.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hey, maybe starting with Market Tech. You know, there were some logistical challenges, obviously, with COVID. So, maybe you can give us an update, how things are looking there? Very strong order intake numbers. So, maybe you can talk about that specifically, where's that coming from? Is it very long term contracts or how much of that $100 million plus number should hit the income statement here pretty soon? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So, first of all, yeah, we are definitely seeing progress in terms of growth and demand from clients in Market Tech. So, if we talk specifically about the market infrastructure, technology side of Market Tech, we're definitely finding new clients to serve, which is exciting. We are continuing to grow the number of crypto markets that we're providing technology to digital asset markets providing technology to, but also our core clients are, after a year of a lot of volatility and a lot of focus just on the here and now, they're definitely now focused again on what does it mean to their infrastructure for the future. And our next gen system is, kind of front and center on a lot of clients mind.  So, the order intake is reflecting Alex both some re-upping from existing clients, as well as some new clients that have come in. And so it's a really healthy mix. And the conversations that we're seeing around the world are just much more longer-term driven and more focused on the future. So, we're excited to see that that progressing. And now the fact of the matter is, though, we're still not traveling, right. So, we're still having to, you know, we've adjusted I think pretty well to a remote environment in terms of delivering for clients. And that was a big adjustment and obviously, we had challenges associated with that. But we're still delivering in a remote environment, and we're still selling in a remote environment.  And so, we still think that it will be, you know, kind of improvements over time, but not something where you're going to see, kind of just this huge surge in one period of time. I think that we expect it to be, you know, steady improvement in demand and our ability to deliver over time. But on the Anti Fin Crime side, I should mention, you know on the Anti Financial Crime side, we are, you know, we're doing really well in selling our market surveillance SaaS solution to new clients. Still, that was something we launched beginning of 2020. And it's had a really nice demand curve there. In terms of our trade surveillance solution, we continue to find ways to expand our client relationships. And then of course, on Verafin, we mentioned the fact that they had 36 new customers come in and that business is going really well.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, great. And then just very quick follow-up. The equity revenue capture continues to surprise me. I mean, this quarter again, I don't know if it's been as high in many years. So, can you just talk about the puts and takes and expectations? I know, it's very dynamic, but it would be helpful to understand the trends and what's driving the strength there. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, sure. I think the first thing to mention is, events like the Russell, and the Triple Witch in June, you know those are two very large trading events that do contribute to capture. I think that, but then in general, we are, you know, basically calibrating capture and share, we, you know, we might do some programs to try to make sure that we do, you know, kind of draw in more order flow into the platforms going forward.  So that will ebb and flow a bit, but you're right. It\u2019s at a level that, you know, we're excited that we're able to provide such a great platform or the go to platform for clients and kind of the mix of the types of trading that are happening on a platform resulting in that type of capture. But as I said, you know, we're going to do what we do always, in terms of balancing, kind of share and capture to make sure that we're doing the best thing for our clients, but also managing the business really successfully. So that might ebb and flow a bit in the coming quarters.\nAlex Kramm: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open. \nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. My question is on Corporate Platforms, you know, you highlight ESG for some time as a huge growth area or a large growth opportunity. I look at the IR and ESG, kind of revenue contribution they've been flat to down the last couple of quarters. So, could you let us know or kind of lay out the growth profile from here and how we should think about kind of the growth opportunity going forward?\nAdena Friedman: Sure, well, obviously our IR and ESG services revenues grew 8% in the quarter and year-to-date are up 7%. So, I would actually say that, you know, we're, I'm not quite \u2013 maybe you can let us know what specifically you're looking at and saying it\u2019s flat, but generally, we actually are seeing, you know, as you know, that business has in the past years has been a relatively low grower. But what we've been finding is that more demand for our IR advisory services, more demand for our governance advisory services, and more demand for the tools, both in IR and ESG, have just managed their ESG reporting capabilities, as well as to understand changes in investors. So, we actually have seen it as being, you know, kind of a healthier environment for that business, but maybe there's something specific you're looking at.\nDan Fannon: Yeah, I\u2019m just looking at Slide 7, where you've had 56 million in revenues this quarter, 57 last and 56 in the fourth quarter.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. So, I think that we tend to look at this, kind of year-over-year, but they're certainly \u2013 one of the things to note is that the, you know, it's a relatively cyclical business. So, there are certain things that might come in, let's say in the end of the year, for sure, tends to be a high quarter, but generally on a year-over-year basis, we look at it as the 52 growing to 56.\nDan Fannon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to get your thoughts on some of the market structure developments. Obviously, Chairman Gensler laid out a fairly ambitious agenda recently, with respect to specifically both payment for to flow and the exchange rebates. Obviously early days still, but curious to get your take on how this could be a potential opportunity, maybe in some ways for Nasdaq or some things that could be more problematic?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I think the first thing is, I believe that we seem to be relatively aligned, at least with the overarching agenda of the SEC right now in terms of thinking about how do you maximize competition? How do you maximize price transparency? And how do you maximize market access, right. So, and make it sure it's fair, across both institutional investors and individual investors? And so, if you kind of take that as, kind of the principles that they're operating under and certainly the principles we operate under, I think as they look at all the various components of market structure, I, you know, our view is that while our solutions may be slightly different, our ideas may be slightly different.  There's general alignment. In terms of that, that means things like tick size regimes, also, different incentive programs that might exist are going to be examined. I also would say as we, kind of we all know, the markets are working and operating relatively well. So, to the extent that we think that there can be constant improvement, that's absolutely the case. But our view is, it's better to try incremental iterative improvements than to try something big bang, because the law of unintended consequences are so high.  If you make changes to incentive programs, then you have to understand what all the consequences might be from that in terms of retail investors getting access to free trading, and making sure at the same time that the quotes reflect the supply \u2013 the actual supply and demand of the market. So, a lot of pushes and pulls. So, Alex, I think that it is still early days. We are certainly in active dialogue with the SEC staff, as they come out with their papers, we'll be there to comment and be a part of that debate. But I \u2013 our view is that right now, at least, you know, there's a general alignment of principles, which we think is, we obviously have some optimism around.\nAlex Blostein: Great. And a quick follow-up for Ann, on just around the expense guidance. Just want to make sure that the guide that you guys updated today, it's performer for both the NFI sale and the JV transaction later in the year?\nAnn Dennison: Yes, it is.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks very much.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask about Verafin, I was hoping you might be able to elaborate a bit on how the revenue growth compared to that part of the business versus the underlying new customer growth. I heard you mentioned about 36 new customers coming through on the Verafin inside, just if you can elaborate a bit on the rate, growth rate there of new customers versus revenue? And if also, you could just talk a little bit about the sales strategy on the Verafin part of the business, how you see that evolving? What changes have you made, and how is that getting integrated within the broader Nasdaq?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think that when it comes to the growth within Verafin, there's a really nice balance between new logos or new clients, and then re-upping and expanding relationships with existing clients. So, Verafin is an interesting model. They do weekly release cycles, and they enter into these multi-year agreements with clients, but they're literally enhancing the system every single week, and bringing a lot of new capabilities in under the existing contract. But when they renew the contract, they kind of point to all these improvements and all the value they've created over the prior several years. And so, when they do renew they tend to renew at a higher rate, and you know often also a broader user base.  So, when we look at the growth of revenue, they look at new bookings and then they look at existing client renewals because those also drive revenue growth. And it's actually been quite balanced. You know, it always has been and it continues to be quite balanced in both areas. In terms of a sales strategy, they have an incredible, kind of sales approach and sales disciplines They are incredibly metrics driven and KPI driven, it's amazing to see, kind of how they \u2013 they're very disciplined in the way that they do it. They do most of their sales remotely. They always have.  You know, they always would like you to have conferences and other ways to meet new clients, but they have the ability to do sales successfully in a remote environment. And they've, you know, I think, luckily, that [indiscernible] quite mature, so they haven't had to make a ton of change through the pandemic. And in terms of our impact on that, where we've been focused is opening doors to larger clients, or to maybe they're trying to nurture a new relationship, but they're already a listed customer on Nasdaq.  So, therefore we can leverage our relationship manager to open more doors, and maybe accelerate the sale process or their very large banking relationships. And so we can kind of get them in front of higher level executives to pitch their services, but their, you know, their platform itself is a superior platform.  So, we feel very confident in bring them to customers and saying, we know that they can do better than whatever the client has, you know, existing in their systems. And we've been, that's the one area we've been collaborating on the most. We have a regular meeting, where we go through the pipeline, we examine where we have relationships, where we can stretch them to go to the larger clients, and then strategically, how are we going to move them up the value chain and then move them over into Europe?\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So, you mentioned that eVestment and Solovis, previously you mentioned that these two segments were impacted by COVID, given the role of vaccine and the strong equities market, do you see an acceleration of the demand in this workforce solution and analytics compared to maybe the last quarter and last year? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yeah, we actually have seen a really nice recovery of demand Owen, So, the reason why eVestment and Solovis were impacted by COVID was, first of all, and we bought Solovis right at the beginning of the pandemic. So, the integration took longer than we wanted it to just because we couldn't get together in getting to know people on Zoom is different than getting to know people in a room.  So \u2013 but then also, kind of thinking about the integrated platform and kind of what, how do we demonstrate an integrated solution to our clients that took a little bit longer too because again, the integration took a little longer, but now in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, you're starting to see that demand pick up in terms of asset owners really understanding the intersection between making an asset allocation decision and then managing their portfolio once they make that decision. And we have solutions that provide and kind of bridge that.  So, I think that we've definitely seen a nice acceleration of demand. And you're seeing that in the growth numbers in first quarter and second quarter. And we definitely are, you know, I think that we feel like also investment managers and asset owners are definitely more willing to put money to work to advance their own platforms. And I think that also took a little while for them to realize that they had, you know, it is a very active capital markets backdrop. So, bringing in these solutions can make their lives a lot more efficient. And I think that that demand has also come back.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Just a quick follow up, quick one on NPM, the Nasdaq Private Markets, do you expect to add more strategic partners and [more banks] to platform and also longer-term can you expand this platform to maybe international companies? What are the regulations there? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I mean, over time, we'll examine the idea of bringing in additional banks. I think that we are extremely excited about the group that we have, and what they can do and what they can bring just kind of really immediate value they can provide. But over time, certainly we'll look at whether or not there's a, you know, a value creative way to do that. In terms of international, there are regulations associated with that, but it is an area that we would say that over time, we should be able to globalize the platform. We do bring some foreign issuers into the platform, but it's then they have to, kind of go through, it\u2019s a FINRA broker dealer. So, they have to go through and make sure that all the institutional investors are accredited in a way and are registered appropriately. So, it's definitely isn't completely open to as a global platform at this point. But it's certainly something we have on the agenda.\nOwen Lau: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Just a \u2013 first one on Verafin, Adena, if you can talk a little bit about the opportunities you see in decentralized finance for demand, for Verafin services, especially in AML and other compliance functions are \u2013 is \u2013 are you seeing an opportunity for new business there, incremental to when you initially did the deal? And is that coming from \u2013 are you seeing that from larger institutions that, you know, obviously, you've been laying out, you know, synergy, expectations for?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, it's a great question, and yes. I think that the answer is that as we've seen a lot of change both in terms of the growth of FinTechs and the emergence of [defy], we do see that those two parts of the sector is being really interesting growth opportunities for Verafin. Verafin has been focused on banks and \u2013 but the fact is, some FinTechs have been leveraging banks in order to manage their fraud in AML detection programs. And so, what Verafin will do is, they'll put the platform into the bank, and then the bank will then, kind of become a subcontractor to the FinTech.  Well, over time, I think that Verafin understands that really, they could become obviously a direct provider to this FinTechs. And that would be the case, of course, with the defy providers as well. And some, I think that they have a really, truly a superior, particularly on fraud detection, and AML detection as well. There's a network effect that they have because they have 2,000 banks in their network that allows for them to, frankly just be better at eliminating false positives and focusing in on real potential fraud issues.  So, we do think that we have a chance to expand there, and they're very excited about that as a near-term opportunity. And it may be that we choose to prioritize that a little bit more in the near-term and take a longer-term view towards some of the global expansion, but right now we're frankly, examining all of those elements and making sure we're prioritizing their time and attention.\nBrian Bedell: Thank you. And then maybe just to follow up on the market structure, some have mentioned [sub-penny pricing] would be one solution to bring more volume on to listed markets, maybe just your thoughts on whether you think that would be one good approach to at least solve for that problem?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, I mean, it certainly is an issue of not having a level playing field between us and dark pools and internalizers, so we certainly think it gives us an opportunity to be able to draw in more flow. I think, though, that when you look at the internalization, there are multiple factors that drive in a retail broker to a specific internalizer and obviously, paying for [close part of that] the ability for internalizers to make good unbroken trades is another area that they focus on. There are a range of services that internalizers provide, but if we could make it through that, I mean, the fact is, they really just can't put a lot of orders into our platform, because we don't have the ability to offer sub-penny pricing, and that is where they're getting executed.  So that is a \u2013 that will break down a barrier. But you know, we have to look holistically at the range of things that we do and what we can do to attract more retail flow in. One point is in Europe, actually, most retail orders actually come to the Nasdaq Nordic platform. We have great relationships, direct [indiscernible] to the retail brokers and they execute their trades. They place the orders in our book. They're visible, and so that, you know, they get more order interaction and they have a great execution experience. So, we do think that if you level the playing field, we can compete for that order flow.\nBrian Bedell: It's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. So, just a few questions on the ETP, the sponsor switches, first just a clarification question regarding the 3 million revenue impact per quarter, is that solely the impact moving forward or was some of that impact already felt in the 2Q index revenues? And then as a follow up to that, historically, can you remind us if there's, if you've seen many sponsor switches, historically, or is more of a one off event? And then lastly, will these Vanguard and BlackRock decisions at all impact broader pricing decisions or pricing strategy for the index business moving forward?\nAdena Friedman: I'll have Ann answer the first question. Go ahead.\nAnn Dennison : Sure. So, on the 3 million that I referenced at the start, we haven't seen any of that impact yet. The 17 billion in assets moved at the end of the second quarter. And so we'd expect to see some of the 3 million impacts, you know, you could think about it as maybe roughly half in the third quarter, and then the full run rate in the fourth quarter. With regard to sponsor switches in the past, we do not, you know, it's not something that we've seen, it's really, this is an unusual event. And it's something that we see as kind of a one-off type of situation. We've had a lot of dialogue with all of the remaining clients that we have. And frankly, BlackRock and Vanguard remain clients, just smaller ones.  And, and so, we feel very good about all of the partnerships we have with our clients. I think that obviously, you know, anytime a sponsor switches, you do self reflection, and you want to make sure that we're doing we're giving them absolutely the best service possible. And so, we will continue to make improvements across our business just to make sure that we're the ones they switch to. And we have certainly been the ones, the index provider that other sponsors have switched to in the past. So, we feel very good about our platform, but we can always improve. And so, but I would say this is not something that's frequent. The other thing is, if some of the sponsors have also made other switches.  So, it's not, we're not the only ones that they've made the decision around. They've made decisions around other providers as well. In terms of pricing, we don't see this as a reason to examine pricing. It really has \u2013 it has to do with \u2013 we feel very good about the way that we price our products. We do that based on the complexity of an index, the uniqueness of the index, the types of investors we're trying to attract into the index. And you know, what's the size and scope of the opportunity. So, we will continue to do our pricing the way we always have.\nKyle Voigt: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. Curious if you can talk about some of the previous challenges that may have limited Nasdaq Private Markets traction in the marketplace? And I guess along with that, how do you see the long-term addressable market? How would you size that, and the opportunity that you're trying to go after with this joint venture?\nAdena Friedman: Great. So, challenges in the past have been \u2013 there's a lot of them. So, one is just the inefficiency that exists in the system. And, as well as, kind of the hesitancy in the past for private companies to offer liquidity options. I think that's been frankly, the biggest impediment in the past. You know, private companies, obviously, when they bring in early stage investors, they want them to be in there for a long time. When they issue equity to their employees, they want their employees to be locked up for a long time.  However, today, it's a very, very vibrant environment, and private companies are staying private longer. And over time, they realized that unlocking liquidity is actually can be very creative, because number one, their employees over time, they want to buy houses and send their kids to school and be able to use their equity in ways that help manage their lives. And so, offering a fair way and in a high integrity way to offer that liquidity is really important. The second \u2013 and to attract talent to these days to have some sort of liquidity program as part of talent acquisition for private companies becoming more interesting and something that we're seeing.  The second is that obviously getting early stage investors, some returns, and then bringing in later stage investors who can carry the firm's over time into the public markets is highly interesting. And so, there's just been this really steady increase in corporate interest in liquidity. And we've seen an acceleration of that in the last couple of years.  Private companies are really balancing, do we go public, do we stay private? If we stay private, how do we make sure that we have a nice liquidity capability within the company? And then of course, with direct listings, there's what we call continuous trading programs that are being developed in advance of those companies, tapping the public markets.  So, I think all of those things have accelerated the interest. And now it's a matter of us really bringing together the institutional community, the venture community, and the private company community to \u2013 and our, obviously our technology capabilities, and our market knowhow to say, okay, how do we catalyze this into a really robust and efficient liquidity marketplace? So, we see this as being, you know, just a huge opportunity.  In terms of the total market opportunity, it's hard to measure something that doesn't exist, but when we look at it and say, what do we think the liquidity could be and what kind of, you know, revenue opportunity could there be? We actually size it anywhere between, kind of 500 million to 1.5 billion. So, it's a big opportunity that we're going after, over the next 5 years to 10 years.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. And then my quick related follow-up, does the current expense guidance reflect pushing the Nasdaq Private Market expenses into the JV?\nAnn Dennison : Yes, it does.\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a question from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the Verafin opportunity, I mean [it\u2019s not] going unnoticed to me and others that the growth of this quarter was pretty astonishing. I think it was around 37% on a sort of organic basis, which, and you've talked about in the past your ability to help accelerate the revenue growth there. So, I'm kind of interested in how you think about the expense side and the investment requirements, should Verafin continue to see this level of heightened growth over the next few years? And how you've accounted for that in your longer-term model? Just wondering if there's any considerations we need to think about on the plus or minus side of that?\nAdena Friedman: So, I would say that the growth has been, it continues to be, I really should say, quite robust. And so, your math it seems pretty accurate. I think that in terms of the way that we are approaching this business is, we see a very long-term, high growth opportunity, right? So, the overall anti-financial crime space is growing at like 17% a year. It\u2019s a huge, huge opportunity $6 billion to $8 billion TAM or SAM frankly, the TAM is much bigger, but the SAM is in that range.  And so, if we invest in the platform, we are actively investing and we will continue actively to invest in the platform to make sure we can continue the, kind of growth that they're exhibiting today. And so, we've talked about this, you know, when, you know, we've actually been pretty clear as to the fact that we're not getting maximizing margin, right now we're going to be maximizing growth.  And, you know, the EBITDA\u2019s \u2013 when we talked about it upon acquisitions in the range of 25%, and we expect that we will try to, kind of maintain that, kind of margin while we're growing as fast as we can. But over time, obviously, as the space matures, we have, but there certainly is \u2013 are ways that we can scale it, but right now, we're going to maintain that growth mode, and still be able to deliver a really nice bottom line, you know, in a high growth business to our shareholders.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. That's pretty useful. And just as a follow up, in terms of your capacity for deploying your capital for other inorganic opportunities, could you talk about, sort of where you feel you've got the most capacity both financially and also from a personnel perspective to digest and execute on deals?\nAdena Friedman: Well, in terms of, yeah, so I think that the way that we look at it from a discipline perspective, a capital discipline perspective, as we've said, you know, for we, we are an investment grade company, and we generally seek to maintain our investment grade status. And at the same time, we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to capture new growth and expansion opportunities, and with some areas of particular focus. One is in the anti-financial crime space.  The second is in the investments below this kind of space in terms of asset owner, asset management workflow solutions, particularly focused on the private markets there. And then the third is an ESG. But we also do look at things that are in Corporate Services, like Puro.earth is a marketplace that really serves corporates for carbon removals. We continue to find ways that we want to serve our, you know, corporate clients in our marketplace solutions.  And so we will always, you know, we look holistically at acquisition opportunities. But we have these three focus areas that I mentioned. But I also would say this, you know, we are incredibly focused on our organic growth. And I think we're delivering really strong growth and we want to continue to deliver really strong growth for our clients and our shareholders through our organic means, but when we look at acquisitions we have those focus areas that I mentioned.\nSimon Clinch: Fantastic. Thanks so much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Okay. Well, I think that we're going to close it out. So, thank you very much for your time today. And we're really pleased to see that our business is delivering strong revenue growth for the quarter and for the year. Guided by our strategic direction, we have a clear focus for the remainder of 2021 as we re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. And I look forward to updating you all on our progress in the months to come. So, thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2021 financial and business performance, as well as the progress we've made to drive forward along our strategic direction. I would like to begin by acknowledging the Nasdaq team's deep commitment and delivering results for our clients, while creating sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. Nasdaq's mission reflects our focus on becoming the premier platform and ecosystem for the global capital markets and beyond with unmatched technology, insights, and markets expertise, and we made important progress during the second quarter. Our financial results demonstrate our business' ability to capture opportunity in a unique economic environment, even as we continue to strengthen its positioning for long-term growth. We see strong demand for many of our products and services as corporate issuers, institutional investors, banks, brokers, and marketplace operators all navigate today's rapidly changing world. Our core foundational marketplaces benefited from an active capital market backdrop, that's all record setting industry U.S. equity and options trading volumes in the first half of 2021. Our client first model has also driven our ability to win the majority of new listings in one of the strongest periods of industry activity in years. Meanwhile, expanding demand from institutional owners for index strategies, as well as asset allocation and portfolio management tools from banks for modern anti-financial crime solutions; and from corporates for ESG and Investor Relations solutions underpinned our performance in the Solutions segment businesses. Our performance in these businesses is also a testament to our client centric approach, and strategically aligned offerings as we invest in and grow new and innovative technology to meet that demand. We also achieved other important milestones against our corporate journey this quarter. First, Nasdaq completed the sale of our U.S. fixed income business to Tradeweb Markets at the end of the second quarter. Second, we announced our strategic investment in Puro.earth, a leading carbon removal marketplace, along with the launch of our new ESG Data Hub these solutions further expand the ways that we can partner with our clients to support their unique sustainability efforts. And third, we announced yesterday that we are starting an exciting next chapter for the Nasdaq private market as part of our partnership with a group of leading banks in the private market space. It highlights both the success of the private market platform we developed at Nasdaq and the growing interest in developing a robust ecosystem for private company liquidity. All of these actions underscore our commitment to our strategy and allow us to reprioritize elements of our unique business model to advance our focus on the most impactful secular opportunities.  I will now turn to our financial results from the second quarter of 2021. Overall, Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $846 million, an increase of $147 million or 21% from the prior year period, driven by 18% organic revenue growth in our Solutions segment and 10% organic growth in our Market Services businesses. We continue to execute against key secular growth opportunities as illustrated by strong momentum in our institutional investor analytics and anti-financial crime solutions businesses, as well as the broad-based growth in total company ARR of $1.8 billion. This equated to an increase of 22%, compared to the prior year period, reflecting both the acquisition of Verafin and a 12% increase in our existing ARR. Turning now to specific segment highlights from the second quarter, I'll begin with our foundational marketplace in corporate businesses. Our Market Services segment saw net revenues of $312 million. That's 13% increase from the prior year period. Market Services transactional revenues, the sum of our cash equity, equity derivative, and fixed income commodities trading businesses increased by 27% in total, in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the prior year period, with the largest contributor of this being our equity derivatives revenues, where we experienced strong increases in U.S. options industry volume.  Nasdaq's options markets, specifically traded $782 million of multiply listed options contracts, an increase of 28% year-over-year. Driven by an active dynamic equities market we've also seen increased levels of activity from companies seeking to tap the public market to raise capital, which has resulted in a 13% increase in the overall number of operating companies listed on the U.S. on Nasdaq in the last 12 months. Specifically, we have 352 more operating companies listed on Nasdaq in the U.S. than we did in June of 2020. The increase in our number of listed companies naturally contributes to higher industry volumes and contributes to higher trading on Nasdaq in particular, since we have approximately 2 times higher market share in our own listed stocks than we have in stocks listed on other markets. I would also like to highlight for a moment another record breaking Nasdaq Closing Cross during the annual Russell U.S. Indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. The Closing Cross successfully executed 2.3 billion shares of Nasdaq listed securities representing approximately $81 billion in market value, and occurred in under 2 seconds. This Closing Cross was 760 million shares larger than our second largest Closing Cross ever, which occurred in March of this year with the Triple Witch expiration. I'm incredibly proud of our team as this milestone underscores our leadership and operating the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure. Next, our corporate platform segment delivered revenues of $154 million, a 22% increase year-over-year. The business continues to thrive with elevated levels of new listings since the market recovery in the second half of 2020. In our listings business Nasdaq again led U.S. Exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 135 IPOs that raised $31.7 billion, including 88 operating company IPOs, and 47 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq Stock Market led U.S. exchanges with a 78% total win rate on IPOs, as well as executing the largest direct listing ever, Coinbase. In addition to new listings, we also welcomed 10 switches in the second quarter of 2021, representing a combined $183 billion in market value, including Honeywell, a DOW 30 company. The total market value of all companies transferring to Nasdaq since 2016 now exceeds $1 trillion. Meanwhile, our Nordic listing platform hosted 62 IPOs in the second quarter, bringing the total to 86 in the first half of 2021, contributing to an 11% year-over-year increase in the Nordic listed issuer base compared to the prior year quarter. Nasdaq is proud to be the exchange partner supporting companies throughout their corporate lifecycle with our commitment to providing issuers with an industry leading market model and a full suite of investor relations, Board engagement, and ESG solutions. Revenues in our IR and ESG services increased $4 million or 8% to $56 million in the second quarter, compared to the prior year period, as we continue to see strong demand for our Investor Relations and advisory in ESG product offerings. The economic impacts of the pandemic combined with a sudden and likely lasting landscape of virtual or hybrid investor engagement, has increased corporates focus on investor relationship and has accelerated their professionalization of their ESG program, both of which has intensified the demand for new data and tools to power their program. Now, let me take a minute to talk about the actions we've taken to advance the Nasdaq Private Market going forward. This week we announced an agreement to contribute Nasdaq Private Market into a joint venture with Silicon Valley Bank, Citi, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley. This creates a new entity to build upon NPM's success becoming the leading marketplace platform for issuer led private company tender transactions. The partnership will enable increased investment in a broader set of capabilities designed to enhance NPM's position as the go-to marketplace for private company liquidity. Now, their private market will continue to expand from its foundation of facilitating private company tender programs to enhance and refine its buyside book-building, auctions, investor block trades, and pre-direct listing continuous trading program. Additionally, the platform will provide end-to-end settlement and through the new ownership structure will create a unique and powerful distribution network serving private companies and institutional investors. Nasdaq's Market Technology business will be contracted to supply NPM as technology platform on a go forward basis.  Nasdaq Private Markets talented team has made strong progress in the seven years since we established the business as measured by the close relationships we've built with more than 250 leading private companies worldwide, and the more than $30 billion in transaction volume that they've executed for many of the world's largest private companies. This new entity will expand upon that success going forward. In the last 12 months, ended June 30, revenues for Nasdaq Private Market increased $13 million, or approximately 200% over the prior year period. Going forward with our partners, we expect to unlock significantly more value for our clients and shareholders by advancing the market for private company shares with the high integrity advanced platform that facilitates liquidity in new ways and build on the momentum that we've developed over the past several years. Now, let me turn to our market technology and investment intelligence segments. Our market technology segment delivered $117 million in revenues at 39% increase year-over-year, including a 5% organic increase from our existing business and an additional $27 million contribution from Verafin. Revenues in the second quarter of 2021 also included a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associate with the closing of the Verafin transaction. In our anti-financial crime technology business, revenues increased $29 million or 88%, driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin, as well as the continued growth in surveillance solutions. With Verafin as part of Nasdaq for its first full quarter, we continue to find great opportunities, working collaboratively with the Verafin team to open doors to new clients and expand their footprint. Verafin signed 36 new clients during the second quarter, and we remain extremely pleased with the business and its growth potential as it achieves its mission of fighting financial crime.  In our marketplace infrastructure technology business revenues increased $4 million or 8% in the second quarter of 2021, compared to the second quarter of 2020. New order intake for market technology hit a sixth quarter high at $81 million, excluding Verafin. Market technology ARR increased 9% year-over-year also included \u2013 excluding the impact of Verafin. If you include Verafin, Nasdaq market technologies ARR increased 61%. Turning to our investment intelligence segment, we delivered net revenues of $263 million, up $50 million or 23% from the prior year period. Overall assets under management and ETPs benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $415 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 53% from the prior year period.  We are pleased to expand our long standing partnership with Invesco during the second quarter with the launch of two new thematics technology ETF tracking the Nasdaq Biotech Index, and the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index. These two indexes are the longest standing benchmark for their respective sectors and in the past year have increased in relevance for investors given the recent pandemic related events. We also continue to see strong global interest in our index franchise with 12 of 15 new and licensed ETP launches in the second quarter occurring outside of the U.S. We are committed to bringing investment opportunities through our index partnerships and empower investors globally with access to diversified investment opportunities. For example, XP Inc., a technology driven investment management platform Brazil launched one of the first locally listed Nasdaq 100 ETF offerings in Latin America during the second quarter, while Hashdex, also from Brazil, partner with Nasdaq to launch the world's first ETF available in Brazil to investors utilizing the Nasdaq Crypto Index. During the quarter, two ETP sponsors, BlackRock and Vanguard announced that they would be switching and consolidating their relationships with some index providers, and as a consequence, certain of their products would no longer be licensing Nasdaq Indexes. While we're always disappointed to lose sponsors, the loss had a minimal financial impact, which Ann will touch on in her comments. And the continued expansion of our relationships with the broader sponsor universe, as well as the continued innovation and growth of the index product suite gives us great cause for optimism going forward. Turning next to our analytics business, we've delivered revenues of $50 million, a 14% increase from the prior year period due to growth in investment and service revenues from hire new sales and increased retention. Driven in part by the success of the enterprise license contracting initiative, which spread usage of eVestment's unique analytics to more users in more business areas of our client base. Lastly, revenues in our market data business rose 5%, as compared to the prior year period to $106 million, driven primarily by expanding international demand for proprietary data products. As our business our clients in the broader markets begin to prepare to operate in a post pandemic environment, we're excited to carry forward the strong momentum from the first half of 2021 and into the future. One increased area of focus for us is ESG, which we've seen growing interest from a range of clients in both the U.S. and Europe. Nasdaq's position at the intersection of financial, corporate, and regulatory communities gives us a unique perspective of on corporate sustainability. From this vantage point, we're actively engaging with clients to help them successfully navigate the complex and fast maturing ESG landscape. We were thrilled to have the opportunity in the second quarter to add Puro.earth, the marketplace for carbon removal solutions to help our corporate clients meet their emission reduction commitments. At the same time, as a public company ourselves, we engage with our employees and our communities to improve our own practices, performance, and transparency on our own ESG journey. In that regard, I encourage our stakeholders to review our recently published and expanded sustainability report, which is available on our website. As a wrap-up, I want to highlight how each of our businesses has expanded the diversity and depth of their client base in recent years, which underpins the strength and resiliency of the Nasdaq platform as you move through each quarter. Our strong engine of talent and technology is allowing us to expand our position in the capital markets in ways that can capitalize on the powerful secular tailwinds in a post pandemic period. We're leading Nasdaq into the second half of 2021 with incredible momentum and I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in detail. Great. Thanks Rich. So, first of all, we are really, really excited about the partnership we've created. And we basically, we contributed the Nasdaq Private Markets asset. The other firms contributed investment dollars, so that we can continue to build out the platform and grow and expand the footprint of Nasdaq Private Market going forward. We have a large minority stake. So, we are the largest shareholder and we will retain that. In terms of the revenue for the last [12 months] (ph), you did the math right. So, it's 20 million for \u2013 on an on an LTM basis. So \u2013 but I would say that, that we are, you know, we do think that this is an opportunity for us to really accelerate our progress in the private company share liquidity programs, and we're seeing a lot of interesting and additional programs or interest from institutional investors from other shareholders to really use the Nasdaq Private Market for price discovery, maybe continuous trading programs and other things like that. And we think that with the partners that we have between the West Coast with Silicon Valley Bank and their relationships with the venture community and early stage private companies, the institutional connections that Citi and Morgan Stanley and Goldman have.  And then us as a marketplace operator and our expertise and our relationships with later stage private companies. It's kind of like this, this great coming together of talent and network and distribution capabilities that we think that we can really, really accelerate the progress and create a lot of value for our shareholders, even with a large minority interest as opposed to 100% interest. So, that is the thesis, and we're really excited to get going with them and it should actually close pretty quickly. We've gotten a lot of approvals, so we should be able to get this going very quickly. So, it's 10 million for market services, and then there's also revenue coming out of the investment intelligence business which is the data part of NFI. So, those two together that make up their revenues that are coming out. In terms of profitability, it was profitable, I mean, it is profitable, but not to the same degree as the rest of our business. Yeah. Great. Thank you. Hey, Alex. Sure. So, first of all, yeah, we are definitely seeing progress in terms of growth and demand from clients in Market Tech. So, if we talk specifically about the market infrastructure, technology side of Market Tech, we're definitely finding new clients to serve, which is exciting. We are continuing to grow the number of crypto markets that we're providing technology to digital asset markets providing technology to, but also our core clients are, after a year of a lot of volatility and a lot of focus just on the here and now, they're definitely now focused again on what does it mean to their infrastructure for the future. And our next gen system is, kind of front and center on a lot of clients mind.  So, the order intake is reflecting Alex both some re-upping from existing clients, as well as some new clients that have come in. And so it's a really healthy mix. And the conversations that we're seeing around the world are just much more longer-term driven and more focused on the future. So, we're excited to see that that progressing. And now the fact of the matter is, though, we're still not traveling, right. So, we're still having to, you know, we've adjusted I think pretty well to a remote environment in terms of delivering for clients. And that was a big adjustment and obviously, we had challenges associated with that. But we're still delivering in a remote environment, and we're still selling in a remote environment.  And so, we still think that it will be, you know, kind of improvements over time, but not something where you're going to see, kind of just this huge surge in one period of time. I think that we expect it to be, you know, steady improvement in demand and our ability to deliver over time. But on the Anti Fin Crime side, I should mention, you know on the Anti Financial Crime side, we are, you know, we're doing really well in selling our market surveillance SaaS solution to new clients. Still, that was something we launched beginning of 2020. And it's had a really nice demand curve there. In terms of our trade surveillance solution, we continue to find ways to expand our client relationships. And then of course, on Verafin, we mentioned the fact that they had 36 new customers come in and that business is going really well. Yeah, sure. I think the first thing to mention is, events like the Russell, and the Triple Witch in June, you know those are two very large trading events that do contribute to capture. I think that, but then in general, we are, you know, basically calibrating capture and share, we, you know, we might do some programs to try to make sure that we do, you know, kind of draw in more order flow into the platforms going forward.  So that will ebb and flow a bit, but you're right. It's at a level that, you know, we're excited that we're able to provide such a great platform or the go to platform for clients and kind of the mix of the types of trading that are happening on a platform resulting in that type of capture. But as I said, you know, we're going to do what we do always, in terms of balancing, kind of share and capture to make sure that we're doing the best thing for our clients, but also managing the business really successfully. So that might ebb and flow a bit in the coming quarters. Sure, well, obviously our IR and ESG services revenues grew 8% in the quarter and year-to-date are up 7%. So, I would actually say that, you know, we're, I'm not quite \u2013 maybe you can let us know what specifically you're looking at and saying it's flat, but generally, we actually are seeing, you know, as you know, that business has in the past years has been a relatively low grower. But what we've been finding is that more demand for our IR advisory services, more demand for our governance advisory services, and more demand for the tools, both in IR and ESG, have just managed their ESG reporting capabilities, as well as to understand changes in investors. So, we actually have seen it as being, you know, kind of a healthier environment for that business, but maybe there's something specific you're looking at. Yeah. So, I think that we tend to look at this, kind of year-over-year, but they're certainly \u2013 one of the things to note is that the, you know, it's a relatively cyclical business. So, there are certain things that might come in, let's say in the end of the year, for sure, tends to be a high quarter, but generally on a year-over-year basis, we look at it as the 52 growing to 56. Sure. Well, I think the first thing is, I believe that we seem to be relatively aligned, at least with the overarching agenda of the SEC right now in terms of thinking about how do you maximize competition? How do you maximize price transparency? And how do you maximize market access, right. So, and make it sure it's fair, across both institutional investors and individual investors? And so, if you kind of take that as, kind of the principles that they're operating under and certainly the principles we operate under, I think as they look at all the various components of market structure, I, you know, our view is that while our solutions may be slightly different, our ideas may be slightly different.  There's general alignment. In terms of that, that means things like tick size regimes, also, different incentive programs that might exist are going to be examined. I also would say as we, kind of we all know, the markets are working and operating relatively well. So, to the extent that we think that there can be constant improvement, that's absolutely the case. But our view is, it's better to try incremental iterative improvements than to try something big bang, because the law of unintended consequences are so high.  If you make changes to incentive programs, then you have to understand what all the consequences might be from that in terms of retail investors getting access to free trading, and making sure at the same time that the quotes reflect the supply \u2013 the actual supply and demand of the market. So, a lot of pushes and pulls. So, Alex, I think that it is still early days. We are certainly in active dialogue with the SEC staff, as they come out with their papers, we'll be there to comment and be a part of that debate. But I \u2013 our view is that right now, at least, you know, there's a general alignment of principles, which we think is, we obviously have some optimism around. Thank you. Sure. Yeah, I mean, I think that when it comes to the growth within Verafin, there's a really nice balance between new logos or new clients, and then re-upping and expanding relationships with existing clients. So, Verafin is an interesting model. They do weekly release cycles, and they enter into these multi-year agreements with clients, but they're literally enhancing the system every single week, and bringing a lot of new capabilities in under the existing contract. But when they renew the contract, they kind of point to all these improvements and all the value they've created over the prior several years. And so, when they do renew they tend to renew at a higher rate, and you know often also a broader user base.  So, when we look at the growth of revenue, they look at new bookings and then they look at existing client renewals because those also drive revenue growth. And it's actually been quite balanced. You know, it always has been and it continues to be quite balanced in both areas. In terms of a sales strategy, they have an incredible, kind of sales approach and sales disciplines They are incredibly metrics driven and KPI driven, it's amazing to see, kind of how they \u2013 they're very disciplined in the way that they do it. They do most of their sales remotely. They always have.  You know, they always would like you to have conferences and other ways to meet new clients, but they have the ability to do sales successfully in a remote environment. And they've, you know, I think, luckily, that [indiscernible] quite mature, so they haven't had to make a ton of change through the pandemic. And in terms of our impact on that, where we've been focused is opening doors to larger clients, or to maybe they're trying to nurture a new relationship, but they're already a listed customer on Nasdaq.  So, therefore we can leverage our relationship manager to open more doors, and maybe accelerate the sale process or their very large banking relationships. And so we can kind of get them in front of higher level executives to pitch their services, but their, you know, their platform itself is a superior platform.  So, we feel very confident in bring them to customers and saying, we know that they can do better than whatever the client has, you know, existing in their systems. And we've been, that's the one area we've been collaborating on the most. We have a regular meeting, where we go through the pipeline, we examine where we have relationships, where we can stretch them to go to the larger clients, and then strategically, how are we going to move them up the value chain and then move them over into Europe? Thank you, Michael. Sure. Yeah, we actually have seen a really nice recovery of demand Owen, So, the reason why eVestment and Solovis were impacted by COVID was, first of all, and we bought Solovis right at the beginning of the pandemic. So, the integration took longer than we wanted it to just because we couldn't get together in getting to know people on Zoom is different than getting to know people in a room.  So \u2013 but then also, kind of thinking about the integrated platform and kind of what, how do we demonstrate an integrated solution to our clients that took a little bit longer too because again, the integration took a little longer, but now in the fourth quarter of 2020 and into 2021, you're starting to see that demand pick up in terms of asset owners really understanding the intersection between making an asset allocation decision and then managing their portfolio once they make that decision. And we have solutions that provide and kind of bridge that.  So, I think that we've definitely seen a nice acceleration of demand. And you're seeing that in the growth numbers in first quarter and second quarter. And we definitely are, you know, I think that we feel like also investment managers and asset owners are definitely more willing to put money to work to advance their own platforms. And I think that also took a little while for them to realize that they had, you know, it is a very active capital markets backdrop. So, bringing in these solutions can make their lives a lot more efficient. And I think that that demand has also come back. Sure. I mean, over time, we'll examine the idea of bringing in additional banks. I think that we are extremely excited about the group that we have, and what they can do and what they can bring just kind of really immediate value they can provide. But over time, certainly we'll look at whether or not there's a, you know, a value creative way to do that. In terms of international, there are regulations associated with that, but it is an area that we would say that over time, we should be able to globalize the platform. We do bring some foreign issuers into the platform, but it's then they have to, kind of go through, it's a FINRA broker dealer. So, they have to go through and make sure that all the institutional investors are accredited in a way and are registered appropriately. So, it's definitely isn't completely open to as a global platform at this point. But it's certainly something we have on the agenda. Yeah, it's a great question, and yes. I think that the answer is that as we've seen a lot of change both in terms of the growth of FinTechs and the emergence of [defy], we do see that those two parts of the sector is being really interesting growth opportunities for Verafin. Verafin has been focused on banks and \u2013 but the fact is, some FinTechs have been leveraging banks in order to manage their fraud in AML detection programs. And so, what Verafin will do is, they'll put the platform into the bank, and then the bank will then, kind of become a subcontractor to the FinTech.  Well, over time, I think that Verafin understands that really, they could become obviously a direct provider to this FinTechs. And that would be the case, of course, with the defy providers as well. And some, I think that they have a really, truly a superior, particularly on fraud detection, and AML detection as well. There's a network effect that they have because they have 2,000 banks in their network that allows for them to, frankly just be better at eliminating false positives and focusing in on real potential fraud issues.  So, we do think that we have a chance to expand there, and they're very excited about that as a near-term opportunity. And it may be that we choose to prioritize that a little bit more in the near-term and take a longer-term view towards some of the global expansion, but right now we're frankly, examining all of those elements and making sure we're prioritizing their time and attention. Yeah, I mean, it certainly is an issue of not having a level playing field between us and dark pools and internalizers, so we certainly think it gives us an opportunity to be able to draw in more flow. I think, though, that when you look at the internalization, there are multiple factors that drive in a retail broker to a specific internalizer and obviously, paying for [close part of that] the ability for internalizers to make good unbroken trades is another area that they focus on. There are a range of services that internalizers provide, but if we could make it through that, I mean, the fact is, they really just can't put a lot of orders into our platform, because we don't have the ability to offer sub-penny pricing, and that is where they're getting executed.  So that is a \u2013 that will break down a barrier. But you know, we have to look holistically at the range of things that we do and what we can do to attract more retail flow in. One point is in Europe, actually, most retail orders actually come to the Nasdaq Nordic platform. We have great relationships, direct [indiscernible] to the retail brokers and they execute their trades. They place the orders in our book. They're visible, and so that, you know, they get more order interaction and they have a great execution experience. So, we do think that if you level the playing field, we can compete for that order flow. I'll have Ann answer the first question. Go ahead. Great. So, challenges in the past have been \u2013 there's a lot of them. So, one is just the inefficiency that exists in the system. And, as well as, kind of the hesitancy in the past for private companies to offer liquidity options. I think that's been frankly, the biggest impediment in the past. You know, private companies, obviously, when they bring in early stage investors, they want them to be in there for a long time. When they issue equity to their employees, they want their employees to be locked up for a long time.  However, today, it's a very, very vibrant environment, and private companies are staying private longer. And over time, they realized that unlocking liquidity is actually can be very creative, because number one, their employees over time, they want to buy houses and send their kids to school and be able to use their equity in ways that help manage their lives. And so, offering a fair way and in a high integrity way to offer that liquidity is really important. The second \u2013 and to attract talent to these days to have some sort of liquidity program as part of talent acquisition for private companies becoming more interesting and something that we're seeing.  The second is that obviously getting early stage investors, some returns, and then bringing in later stage investors who can carry the firm's over time into the public markets is highly interesting. And so, there's just been this really steady increase in corporate interest in liquidity. And we've seen an acceleration of that in the last couple of years.  Private companies are really balancing, do we go public, do we stay private? If we stay private, how do we make sure that we have a nice liquidity capability within the company? And then of course, with direct listings, there's what we call continuous trading programs that are being developed in advance of those companies, tapping the public markets.  So, I think all of those things have accelerated the interest. And now it's a matter of us really bringing together the institutional community, the venture community, and the private company community to \u2013 and our, obviously our technology capabilities, and our market knowhow to say, okay, how do we catalyze this into a really robust and efficient liquidity marketplace? So, we see this as being, you know, just a huge opportunity.  In terms of the total market opportunity, it's hard to measure something that doesn't exist, but when we look at it and say, what do we think the liquidity could be and what kind of, you know, revenue opportunity could there be? We actually size it anywhere between, kind of 500 million to 1.5 billion. So, it's a big opportunity that we're going after, over the next 5 years to 10 years. So, I would say that the growth has been, it continues to be, I really should say, quite robust. And so, your math it seems pretty accurate. I think that in terms of the way that we are approaching this business is, we see a very long-term, high growth opportunity, right? So, the overall anti-financial crime space is growing at like 17% a year. It's a huge, huge opportunity $6 billion to $8 billion TAM or SAM frankly, the TAM is much bigger, but the SAM is in that range.  And so, if we invest in the platform, we are actively investing and we will continue actively to invest in the platform to make sure we can continue the, kind of growth that they're exhibiting today. And so, we've talked about this, you know, when, you know, we've actually been pretty clear as to the fact that we're not getting maximizing margin, right now we're going to be maximizing growth.  And, you know, the EBITDA's \u2013 when we talked about it upon acquisitions in the range of 25%, and we expect that we will try to, kind of maintain that, kind of margin while we're growing as fast as we can. But over time, obviously, as the space matures, we have, but there certainly is \u2013 are ways that we can scale it, but right now, we're going to maintain that growth mode, and still be able to deliver a really nice bottom line, you know, in a high growth business to our shareholders. Well, in terms of, yeah, so I think that the way that we look at it from a discipline perspective, a capital discipline perspective, as we've said, you know, for we, we are an investment grade company, and we generally seek to maintain our investment grade status. And at the same time, we want to make sure that we have the opportunity to capture new growth and expansion opportunities, and with some areas of particular focus. One is in the anti-financial crime space.  The second is in the investments below this kind of space in terms of asset owner, asset management workflow solutions, particularly focused on the private markets there. And then the third is an ESG. But we also do look at things that are in Corporate Services, like Puro.earth is a marketplace that really serves corporates for carbon removals. We continue to find ways that we want to serve our, you know, corporate clients in our marketplace solutions.  And so we will always, you know, we look holistically at acquisition opportunities. But we have these three focus areas that I mentioned. But I also would say this, you know, we are incredibly focused on our organic growth. And I think we're delivering really strong growth and we want to continue to deliver really strong growth for our clients and our shareholders through our organic means, but when we look at acquisitions we have those focus areas that I mentioned. Sure. Okay. Well, I think that we're going to close it out. So, thank you very much for your time today. And we're really pleased to see that our business is delivering strong revenue growth for the quarter and for the year. Guided by our strategic direction, we have a clear focus for the remainder of 2021 as we re-imagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. And I look forward to updating you all on our progress in the months to come. So, thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena and good morning everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. Before we review the financial comparisons and developments, I want to cover some reporting changes going forward, related specifically to some of the strategic developments within the business portfolio that Adena mentioned previously. First, with regards to the Nasdaq Private Market or NPM, as recently announced we have contributed this business to a newly formed joint venture for which we will own a minority interest. As a result, we will no longer consolidate the results and instead will be recognizing our share of net income as a non-operating item, consistent with how we treat other unconsolidated investees. Second, with regards to both NPM and Nasdaq Fixed Income or NFI, beginning in the third quarter of 2021, we will reclassify the revenue and operating expenses of these two businesses out of the corporate platforms, market services, and investment intelligence segment results for all prior periods and move them into corporate items so that the business results of each of these segments can be compared to prior periods on a like-for-like basis. On Slide 12, we provide a table previewing the reclassified operating segment results. Now, I will start by reviewing second quarter revenue performance. The 21% increase in reported net revenue of $846 million is a result of organic growth of 15%, including 18% organic increase in the Solutions segments and a 10% organic increase in Market Services, a 4% positive impact from acquisitions, and a 2% positive impact from changes in FX rates. I will now review the quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments as shown on pages 5 through 8 of the slide presentation. I will start with Investment Intelligence revenue, which increased $50 million or 23%. Organic revenue growth totaled $47 million or 22%. And there was a $3 million positive impact from changes in FX rate. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects very strong growth in our index business, as well as strong contributions from both the analytics and market data businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $547 million, an increase of 11%, compared to the prior year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq's indices rose 53%, compared to the prior year period to $415 billion, including $47 billion from net inflows and $113 billion net increase from market appreciation, partially offset by $17 billion in negative net impact related to an ETP sponsor switching its Index Provider. The investment intelligence segment operating margin of 65% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period. As Adena mentioned earlier, we will see an additional impact to AUM in the third quarter of 2021 related to previously announced ETP sponsor index switches. The total revenue impact of all of the 2021 switches announced to date is estimated to be approximately $3 million per quarter. Market Technology revenue increased $33 million or 39%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $4 million or 5%, $27 million from the acquisition of Verafin and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rate. Excluding a temporary $10 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenues associated with the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have been $37 million. The organic revenue increase, which excludes revenue generated from Verafin during the first 12 months after the acquisition close was driven primarily by higher support and licensing revenues and higher SaaS based surveillance solutions revenues. ARR for Market Technology was $432 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of 9%, compared to the prior period, excluding the impact of Verafin. Including Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 61% in the period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period. Market Technology expenses include a partial reversal of the reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 of approximately $6 million as we finalize client negotiations and updated our estimate of costs to service our client agreements. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $28 million, or 22%. Organic revenue growth totaled $25 million or 20% and there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rate. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the expansion in our listed issuer base together with an increase in IR advisory services and ESG product offering. Corporate Platforms ARR was $509 million, and increased 16% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 42% increased 3 percentage points compared to the prior year period and that was driven by both the continued increase in the listed issuer base and strong activity on the Nasdaq Private Market. Market Services net revenues increased $36 million or 13%. The organic revenue increase was $28 million or 10% and there was an $8 million impact from changes in FX rates.  The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in equity derivatives and trade management services revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on trading revenues. Turning to Pages 9 and 10 to review both expenses and 2021 guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $65 million to $392 million. The increase reflects a 24 million or 7% organic increase, a $26 million increase from the impact of acquisitions, as well as a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates due to a weaker U.S. dollar.  The organic expense increases two main drivers: First, higher variable performance linked compensation expense, reflecting our outstanding revenue growth; and second, increased costs related to what has been a very active capital markets backdrop, including expenses related to increased training capacity and marketing commitments supporting our listing clients. We are narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of 1.59 billion to 1.62 billion to reflect that our strong and broad based organic revenue growth in the first half of 2021 has impacted variable expenses like performance based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, if the performance continues to be strong in relation to our medium-term growth objectives, we would as we said last quarter, expect to come in near the high-end of this updated expense guidance range.  Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $80 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased 1 percentage point, compared to the prior year period. Net interest expense was $33 million in the second quarter of 2021, an increase of $8 million, compared to the prior year period, due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 25% for the second quarter of 2021. For full-year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27% and barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the second quarter of 2021 was $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share, compared to $256 million, or $1.54 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt decreased by $189 million versus the first quarter of 2021, primarily due to a net reduction of $214 million of commercial paper, partially offset by $24 million increase in euro bonds book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months EBITDA ratio ended the period of 3.2 times, a decrease from 3.4 times in the first quarter of 2021. During the second quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $88 million and repurchased common stock in the amount of $248 million. As of June 30, 2021, there was 1.46 billion remaining under the share repurchase authorization. As previously communicated, upon the confirmation of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, we issued approximately 6.2 million shares to a third party. We intend to use the proceeds from the sale, as well as available tax benefits working and clearing capital of this business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset the EPS dilution from the sale. This week, we plan to execute an accelerated share repurchase program for approximately $470 million. Let me talk for a moment about share count expectations. Our average diluted shares outstanding for the second quarter were 166 million. Due to timing, this average reflected only a minimal impact of the 6.2 million and a fire-related share issuance. At the end of the second quarter however, diluted shares outstanding were approximately 172 million. With our plan to execute the accelerated share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2021, at the current share price, we would retire approximately 2 million shares in the third quarter, and roughly a half a million additional shares in the fourth quarter. We plan to execute additional repurchases to offset the remaining NFI dilution in 2022 and 2023. We continue to expect EPS solution from the sale of NFI to be about 2% in the first 12 months following the [June 25 close], but to diminish to immaterial levels after that. I'll wrap up by saying that these capital reallocation actions, both in terms of the sale of NFI and the related capital return program support Nasdaq's acceleration of our strategy, and allow the company to further concentrate our resources on strategic opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, it is. Sure. So, on the 3 million that I referenced at the start, we haven't seen any of that impact yet. The 17 billion in assets moved at the end of the second quarter. And so we'd expect to see some of the 3 million impacts, you know, you could think about it as maybe roughly half in the third quarter, and then the full run rate in the fourth quarter. With regard to sponsor switches in the past, we do not, you know, it's not something that we've seen, it's really, this is an unusual event. And it's something that we see as kind of a one-off type of situation. We've had a lot of dialogue with all of the remaining clients that we have. And frankly, BlackRock and Vanguard remain clients, just smaller ones.  And, and so, we feel very good about all of the partnerships we have with our clients. I think that obviously, you know, anytime a sponsor switches, you do self reflection, and you want to make sure that we're doing we're giving them absolutely the best service possible. And so, we will continue to make improvements across our business just to make sure that we're the ones they switch to. And we have certainly been the ones, the index provider that other sponsors have switched to in the past. So, we feel very good about our platform, but we can always improve. And so, but I would say this is not something that's frequent. The other thing is, if some of the sponsors have also made other switches.  So, it's not, we're not the only ones that they've made the decision around. They've made decisions around other providers as well. In terms of pricing, we don't see this as a reason to examine pricing. It really has \u2013 it has to do with \u2013 we feel very good about the way that we price our products. We do that based on the complexity of an index, the uniqueness of the index, the types of investors we're trying to attract into the index. And you know, what's the size and scope of the opportunity. So, we will continue to do our pricing the way we always have. Yes, it does."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Ditmire, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal and Regulatory Officer and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. I'd like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I'm of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients during this period. A full-year has now passed since our global workforce began working remotely and I could not be more pleased with the first quarter results that our team has delivered to our stakeholders today. Our relentless client focus and Nasdaq's nimbleness allowed us to generate strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. We also made important progress against our corporate strategy during the quarter with the completion of our acquisition of Verafin in February, and the announced agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business to Tradeweb Markets. Our performance during this period continues to underscore the resilience of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model as well as our ability to address the needs of our clients in a rapidly changing environment. Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $851 million, an increase of $150 million, or 21% from the prior-year period, driven by 17% organic growth in our Solutions segment businesses and 17% organic growth in our Market Services business. The acquisition of Verafin and the changes in FX rates drove the remainder of the growth for the business in the quarter. Across our exchange businesses, the incredibly dynamic capital markets environment during the period, combined with our strong competitive positioning, resulted in record U.S. equity and options volumes and a record quarter for new listings. I'm also extremely proud of the progress we've made to continue to grow our annualized recurring revenue or ARR which is up 21% compared to the prior-year period. This was driven by our continued focus on key secular growth opportunities that are powering our Solutions segments. We're seeing rising demand across our clientele for our solutions including from institutional investors for analytics and workflow tools, from corporate clients for our ESG and IR solutions, and from financial institutions and marketplaces for technology that helps reduce financial crime. Our ARR growth was also boosted by the acquisition of Verafin. The strong operating leverage of our model was evident in the results. Our non-GAAP operating margins increased to 54% up two percentage points compared to the prior-year. As a result, we experienced 25% increase in our non-GAAP operating income and a 31% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the period. Turning now to the specific highlights from the quarter, I'll begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segments total net revenues of $338 million, a 20% increase from the prior-year period and a new quarterly revenue record for this business. This was primarily led by higher U.S. options and cash equities trading volumes. We're also seeing an increase in demand for Trade Management Services connectivity solutions, as clients adjust their capacity for a wider range of volume scenarios. Nasdaq U.S. Options market set a quarterly record of 892 million contracts traded during the period, an increase of 57%. While our U.S. equities markets set a quarterly record of 153 million shares traded an increase of 20% year-over-year. Additionally, during the period, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business NFI to an affiliate of Tradeweb Markets. The decision to sell NFI aligns with our strategy to maximize our potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. We expect the transaction to close later in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $155 million, a 21% increase with robust contributions across each of the product areas in that business. The business is boosted by record levels of new listing activity, material contribution from Nasdaq private market following a record first quarter for private company transactions and increased demand for our Investor Relations, Intelligence and ESG solutions. In our IR and ESG services business, we're seeing consistent and growing demand for our expanded suite of products, which has been carefully designed to help our clients' measure, analyze, collaborate and take positive actions regarding their respective Investor Relations, governance, and sustainability programs. For example, in our IR Intelligence unit, we saw six new client wins from our new expanded ESG advisory offering, a more in-depth solution that has lengthened and deepened our engagement with executive leadership teams as they seek to meet the demand from institutional investors and other stakeholders for greater clarity on their ESG strategies. And we're seeing this deeper client engagement results and continued sales momentum for our consultative IR advisory service and our Nasdaq IR insight workflow solutions, which saw a combined 36% increase in sales during the quarter. In our Listing segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 275 IPOs that raised $74.4 billion, including 79 operating company IPOs and 196 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq stock market led U.S. Exchanges with a 69% total win rate on IPOs, including a 77% win rate among operating companies, and a 66% win rate amongst SPACs. Listing highlights from the first quarter include the IPOs of Bumble, Qualtrics, Affirm, Playtika and Petco. During the quarter, Nasdaq listed seven of the top 10 largest IPOs by capital raised. Companies that responded positively to our virtual IPO experience during the pandemic period and we are excited and encouraged to see our iconic Bell ceremony and IPO day experienced come to life again in Times Square, and in cities across the country for our unique Remote Bell ceremony. Highlights include going on the road during the quarter to Bumble in Texas and to Qualtrics in Utah. We look forward to welcoming our clients and capital markets partners safely to the Nasdaq market site for these milestone celebrations as we start to prepare for a post-pandemic period. Of course, I also want to acknowledge the strong start to the second quarter in listings with in particular noting Nasdaq successful direct listing of Coinbase, a global leader in infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. The Coinbase listing represents the largest direct listing in history, and was the largest ever Initial Public listing opening cross on Nasdaq. Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $100 million in revenues including a partial period contribution from the Verafin acquisition, which we completed in February. Our annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was a $416 million, a 62% increase year-over-year, including a 10% increase from our existing business and an additional $134 million representing the annualized total of Verafin's first quarter subscription revenues irrespective of the closing date, or the temporary impact of the write-down of deferred revenues. To give you more transparency and how different parts of Market Technology are operating and progressing going forward, we have started to report our revenues from this segment of our business in two groups. The first is called Marketplace Infrastructure Technology, which will comprise our solutions for the full trade lifecycle to market infrastructure operators, banks and brokers and non-financial market operators. And the second is called Anti Financial Crime Technology, our offerings providing surveillance, risk management, and Verafin's anti-money laundering and fraud detection solutions. As we stated in previous investor calls, there are certain areas of our Market Technology business that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic related factors largely in the Marketplace Infrastructure Technology business. And while the environment continues to be characterized by the logistical challenges to implementations and lengthened sales cycles, the actions we took last year to respond to those dynamics are resulting in stabilize but moderated revenue growth in the near-term, albeit with short-term impact to segment profitability. More importantly, our longer-term vision for Market Technology remains on track, as demonstrated by the progress we've been delivering in new sales and revenues from SaaS products and services, in particular, our Anti Financial Crime Technology Solutions. Excluding the impact of Verafin, SaaS revenues within all of Market Technology increased 15% year-over-year. Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered net revenues of $258 million, up $47 million or 22% from the prior-year period. Overall assets under management in ETPs benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $385 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 87% from the prior-year period, and a new quarterly record. Additionally, trading at futures and options on futures contracts tracking Nasdaq indexes, increased 31% year-over-year. I'm also pleased to see increasing adoption of some of our recent product innovations. In particular, AUM in the Invesco innovation suite built on their strong debut in the fourth quarter of 2020, and now stands at approximately $2 billion in AUM in just five months after launch, making this one of the most successful new launches for Nasdaq's Index business. Our analytics business delivered revenues of $48 million, an increase of $7 million, or 17% from the prior-year period. Led by eVestment and Solovis, this business experienced strong increased growth in the first quarter, due to improvement in both new users and retention compared to the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, new sales were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting growth for our rebound in institutional investment industry demand following some temporary contraction in 2020, as well as increased realizations of the synergies between eVestment and Solovis as the combination help drive 28 new accounts to Solovis in the first quarter. These results underscore our strategy to create comprehensive workflow solutions for investment managers and institutional asset owners from pre-commitment diligence to post-commitment portfolio tracking and secondary trades. Lastly, within Investment Intelligence, our market data revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by expanding international demand for our proprietary data products. As I wrap up, I\u2019d like to reiterate that Nasdaq remains diligently focused on serving the unique needs of our clients, while we advance our strategic mission to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. At our Investor Day in November, we articulated that our diversified business model was designed to provide us with the resiliency to drive disciplined growth across a variety of backdrops. Our recent success, especially in the first quarter, underscores the power of the Nasdaq platform and highlights that the strategy underpinning a repositioned franchise is resonating with our clients, as we continue to reallocate capital to higher growth opportunities, while maintaining leadership in our marketplace core. This focus has also resulted in many new instances of dynamic collaboration across our businesses be it new product innovations or bringing advanced technology solutions to help our clients solve major industry challenges. For example, in our Anti Financial Crime Technology segment, we're very excited about the work that we can do together with Verafin. This includes the potential for new client opportunities given our strong relationships with Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, as the Verafin team continues to build out their solutions to increase confidence in the global financial system. Additionally, we're pleased to support their international expansion, especially into Europe where Verafin has just landed its first client. Another great example is the intersection of our listings and index businesses. Listing the next-generation of innovators, including many of the largest IPOs that have come to Nasdaq in the recent years, create strong synergies to drive new product development in collaboration with our Index business. For example, the strength and success of our Flagship Nasdaq 100 Index, and our partnership with Invesco, laid the groundwork for a recent launch of the Invesco Innovation Suite, including the Invesco Nasdaq Next Generation 100 ETF comprised of the 101st to the 200 largest non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 Index has been one of the fastest growing ETFs that we've ever launched with a partner and includes companies such as Etsy and Roku, as well as many of the fastest growing enterprise technology and healthcare companies listed on our market. As I look back at this quarter, I could not be prouder of the performance across the business. We officially celebrated Nasdaq's 50th anniversary in February and given our rich history as a technology pioneer, I remain confident that we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in greater detail.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $150 million increase in reported net revenue of $851 million is the net result of organic growth of $118 million including 17% organic increase in both Market Services and Solutions segments, a $14 million positive impact from acquisitions, and an $18 million impact from changes in FX rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue which increased $47 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 20%, reflecting very strong growth in our Index business, as well as strong contributions from both our market data and analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $542 million and increased 13% compared to the prior-year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq entities rose 87% year-over-year to $385 billion, including a 25% increase from net inflows and a 62% increase from changes in market impact. On Page 19 of the presentation you'll find our new disclosure on Net flow contribution to the year-over-year change in AUM. The segment operating margin of 65% increased one percentage point compared to the prior-year period. Market Technology revenue increased $19 million or 23%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $3 million or 4%, $12 million from the acquisition of Verafin which closed mid-quarter, and a $4 million impact from the changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have totaled $19 million for the partial quarter period following the February 11, 2021 close. On 510, we showed a runoff of the remaining $23 million purchase price adjustments on Verafin's deferred revenue. The $3 million organic increase in Market Tech was driven primarily by higher SaaS based Anti Financial Crime Technology revenues, in particular from our Market and Trade Surveillance products. ARR for Market Technology was $416 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 62% compared to the prior-year period, largely due to the Verafin acquisition. Excluding Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 10% in the period. In addition to the new Market Technology reporting Adena mentioned earlier, we're supplementing this with another revenue breakdown, disclosing the recurring subscription SaaS and support licensing revenues, as well as the non-recurring professional services contributions to help investors and analysts track our progress as we continue to expand the SaaS contributions across both our Market Infrastructure Technology and Anti Financial Crime Technology businesses. The segment operating margin was a negative 2%, but would have been a positive 5% when excluding the non-cash purchase price adjustment related to Verafin deferred revenue. The 5% margin is not a level that we believe reflects the potential of the business and we continue to feel optimistic about our ambition for a margin that supports Market Technology being a Rule of 40 business in 2023 and beyond. While the impact of the Verafin purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue is temporary, and will be eliminated over the next four quarters, on a core basis, two main factors will drive our margin expansion over the coming years. First, our mix of SaaS subscription revenues within Market Technology is increasing significantly. Looking ahead, we expect it to continue to grow as we execute our strategy. This is critical because our SaaS businesses have approximately two to three times the average contribution margin of the on-premise solutions. Second, we accelerated hiring in certain areas of our Market Technology business in recent quarters and on a temporary basis allocated more of our existing resources to relatively low margin installation work, in particular, in the most complex on-premise clearing solutions. We expect the margin impact to gradually diminish over the coming years. Corporate Platform revenues increased $27 million, or 21%. Organic revenue growth totaled $24 million or 19%. And there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to an increase in IPOs and higher Nasdaq private market revenues together with an increase in both IR and ESG advisory services revenues. Nasdaq private market revenues were about $6 million to $7 million higher than the average quarterly run rate of 2020. And while this business has averaged an over 40% bigger in the last three years, we would expect to see at least $5 million in sequential decline in 2Q 2021 from NTM's particularly strong first quarter. Corporate Platform's ARR was $487 million and increased 12% compared to the prior-year period. The segment operating margin of 42% increased seven percentage points compared to the prior-year period, and was driven by both the unusually strong activity on the Nasdaq private market, as well as from the substantial increase in the listed issuer bid. Market Services net revenues increased $57 million, or 20%. The organic revenue increase was $48 million or 17% and there was a $9 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equity derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes and an increase in Trade Management Services revenues. The segment's operating margin of 67% increased four percentage points from the prior-year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on record trading revenues. Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $57 million to $393 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or 7% organic increase, an $18 million increase from the impact of acquisition, and a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic growth and expenses reflects the sum of one, relatively consistent low-single-digit percentage increase related to hiring and wage inflation; two, higher compensation expense as variable performance linked compensation increase reflecting the company's outstanding growth; and three, costs related to what has been an incredibly active capital markets backdrop. For example, costs related to increasing our trading capacity, as well as marketing commitments supporting the extraordinary number of IPO wins in recent periods. Turning to Slide 10, we're narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first quarter and the impact that growth had on variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, overall as performance continues to be strong, we would expect to come in at the high-end of the expense guidance range. In addition, we expect the year-over-year organic growth and expenses to be elevated particularly in 2Q 2021 compared to 2Q 2020 as the prior-year period had a significant reduction in travel and other in-office activity due to the onset of the pandemic, as well as lower new listing activity and less performance-based compensation due to the uncertain financial environment in 2Q 2020. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $93 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased two percentage points year-over-year. Net interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior-year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. Consistent with our reporting practice, interest expense related to acquisition financing that was incurred prior to the mid quarter close of the transaction was excluded from non-GAAP results for this quarter. And therefore, an incremental $3 million to $4 million of Verafin related interest expense will be reflected in the second quarter results. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2021, which includes a benefit related to the vesting of certain equity awards. For the full-year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27% and barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2021 was $327 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $251 million, or $1.50 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt increased by $349 million versus 4Q 2020, primarily due to net issuances of $435 million of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Verafin acquisition, partially offset by an $87 million decrease in the book values of our Eurobonds caused by changes in FX rates. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.4 times, a decrease from 3.5 times in the fourth quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million, and repurchased common stock in the amount of $162 million. Today, we're announcing a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional billion dollars, subject to the closing of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, an acceleration of the issuance of Nasdaq common stock related to the sale. As previously communicated, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of the business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset EPS dilution. We continue to expect the sale to be temporarily 2% dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in the 12-month period following the close and we see immaterial dilution in periods thereafter. Overall, the actions taken during the first quarter support Nasdaq's accelerated evolution and allow the company to further concentrate its resources on technology, analytics and ESG opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Adena. Good morning, Ann. And I guess, congrats on the strong quarter unique operating conditions. So my question has to do is broad, it has to do with the growth rates that we're experiencing. If you look at the overall growth rate, if you look at Corporate Platforms and Investment Intelligence, you're running three to 4X of the guidance rate. And given you still got probably the comparisons that another quarter or two were relatively stable comparisons. So when do you look at adjusting, I guess, and a lot of this is recurring revenues, as you highlighted. So when do you look at adjusting or the conservatism of the organic growth rate guidance?\nAdena Friedman: Well, thank you. Well, I would say that we are -- we only changed our outlook for our growth rates or what I would say medium to long-term revenue growth rates about two quarters ago. So I'd say that, Rich, we're still -- we still believe that those are the appropriate way, the appropriate growth rates, at least based on a kind of a three to five year time horizon. But having said that, I do agree with you that we are performing well ahead of our outlook and we're obviously extremely pleased with that performance. I think that as we continue to gain more traction across our platforms, and particularly in the Solutions segment, we certainly can look to make those adjustments, but we're sticking with the outlook at this point.\nRich Repetto: Okay. And they're going to be increased by Verafin as well --?\nAdena Friedman: And we'll make some adjustments to that. And when we announced the Verafin acquisition, so we did make those adjustments as part of that announcement.\nRich Repetto: Okay, congrats on the strong quarter. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thank you. Good morning. My question is on the Market Tech segment. Ann, you might have said this, but what was the Verafin contribution of the revenues in the quarter? And then, as we look ahead, as you talk about the margin and reiterating the long-term outlook for the margin, could you help us in the short-term as you mentioned increased costs plus the backdrop from a revenue environment? Are we looking at, what are we looking forward to see this margin march higher? Is it kind of the normalization of expenses plus the revenue or could we just see the margins expand without based on where things sit and kind of the normal progression of the ARR and other portions of the business?\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So on your first question about Verafin's contribution, so within the numbers for the partial quarter, we had $12 million of revenues related to Verafin and so -- and that included $7 million worth of deferred revenue write-down. So on a gross basis, it was $19 million for the partial quarter, which we closed the deal on Feb 11. On your -- Related to your question in Market Tech margins, as we look forward to 2023 and our ambitions of achieving the Rule of 40 for the overall Market Tech. We think the primary way we can get there is through revenue growth, part of that will be bringing Verafin on board. And then the other two things are going to, we should look to; we're going to continue to expand our SaaS offerings. We talked about the growth in our SaaS business, and the fact that our SaaS businesses come at higher contribution margins. So as we continue to expand there, we'll see an impact on the margins. And then the last thing that I've mentioned is just that, we have -- we do have some incremental costs now to deliver on some of our larger, more complex projects. We've added costs and we expect them to gradually decline over time. So when you put those three things together, we expect to achieve that Rule of 40 in 2023. And I think it just brings back, it is important to note that we're confident in the prospects of this business and our ability to be successful here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes, hi, good morning, everyone. On the Listings business. Can you just describe a little bit more what happened in the first quarter? I know you dimensionalize the private market impact, I think $7 million but even without that, it was still a very, very strong quarter on a sequential basis. And I know you highlighted SPACs in particular and I know it was a very strong SPAC quarter. But usually the initial listing fees could amortize over many years. So just wondering is the accounting difference on SPAC listings or anything that that you could point out to kind of bridge the gap and how sustainable that should be going forward given that some of the SPAC enthusiasm seems to be waning a little bit? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Alex. Well, I think that really when you look at the revenue performance in the Listings business; it is on the back of three very strong years of new listings, which of course gets us to a new annualized recurring rate of Listing revenue. We had over I guess in 2019, we had a 189 IPOs. In 2020, we had over I think 314 IPOs. And then this year, already, we've had 275 IPOs. You are right though, with the SPAC Listings, it's a little different. They, first of all, they tend to come in at the capital market, because they want to pay the lowest possible fees. So contributions from SPAC if we look at an overall SPAC annual listing revenue is only about 5% of our total listing revenues. So it is a -- it's not a huge contributor. And of course, when they do combine with companies, then we have the opportunity to bring that company to Nasdaq as an operating company. And that tends to accrue to a higher fee rate. So there's a lot of opportunity from the SPACs as they make this combination to increase our revenue contribution. But it also is pretty limited risk in terms of if this SPACs are not able to find operating companies they want to combine with. But generally speaking, Alex, it's just I think it's kind of a compounding effect of multiple years where we've been -- we've been winning the majority of IPOs and frankly, the vast majority of operating company IPOs. And it's just been a favorable environment for us to be able to bring a lot of new companies to market. So I think it's a combination of all those things. And I should mention also, we had 32 new listings in the Nordics in the first quarter as well. And so that -- that -- that's really bucking the trend in Europe and we continue to see a lot of strength in our Nordics business as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Ghosh: So Adena or Ann, back on Market Tech. So just looking at the Anti Fin Crime bucket, including the four Verafin contribution that you called out, that looks stronger than what we expected just looking at that $46 million bucket for the quarter. Could you talk about either lumpiness or seasonal factors driving that during the quarter, is it anything that we should be thinking about or even as we think about the rest of the year. And related to that, you've noted that you continue to see a little bit of pressure within the Market Tech bucket as a result of the pandemic that hasn't entirely gone away. So just any color as to if I think about the Legacy business on X of Verafin, thinking about the 8% to 11% organic growth rate, if you think about 2021, is that still a feasible and reasonable kind of growth rate? Again, I know it's more of a medium term rate. So if we think about 2021, when we think about the legacy business, is that 8% to 11% still an achievable rate given some of the headwinds and pressures that you're seeing in the business? Thanks a lot.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Sure. Yes, on the Anti Financial Crimes side, it is largely a SaaS oriented business. There are -- so we think about what we put into Anti Financial Crime Sub Segment are the surveillance solutions to market. Some of those are still on-prem, but they're long-term licensed or licensed revenues, not a lot of project-related costs, because that's a pretty a more standardized service. Then you have the SaaS business related to the surveillance for our trading firms and it's all SaaS. And then you have the risk management solutions to both markets and broker dealers, and there that has both the combination of on-prem and SaaS solutions. And then lastly, you have Verafin which is entirely a SaaS business with very low professional fees. So generally speaking it's -- what you're seeing in the quarters is a relatively recurring element of kind of what the potential of the business is. As I mentioned before, we did have 10% growth in our Anti Financial Crime business, absent Verafin. So we continue to see really strong demand for all of those solutions. I think that in terms of the overall growth rate for Market Tech absent Verafin, as we mentioned, the Market Infrastructure Technologies part of the business has been more materially impacted by the pandemic, and we're still in a pandemic. So, we're still not able to go visit clients. These are generally in oftentimes particularly for new clients, these are large scale decisions that they're making, to have us partner with them to build and support them, and their core business technologies. So they tend to be sales cycles that resulting from relationships and it's harder to establish and manage those relationships if we can't visit our clients. So that is still the case, because of the pandemic. However, having said that our existing clients, they really spent last year focusing on managing the very high volume environment in a pretty dynamic capital markets environment as well. As they come into 2021, we are having more constructive conversations with them around thinking longer-term again, thinking about how they want to continue to advance their technology. So we're certainly seeing encouraging signs of working with our clients. But as I said in my comments, we would expect that the short-term growth rates on that part of the business would be -- will be moderated. And but over time, we're not changing our medium to long-term outlook on the overall business because we have confidence that will recover.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Adena, the organic growth has been great in some areas have benefited there from the favorable market backdrop that you mentioned for areas like Index and Listing. But is that moderate when you get past COVID. Do you highlight some of the areas may be negatively impacted by COVID, because you know over the last couple of quarters and talking about Tech that could have financial upside as to a more normal level and maybe offset some of those areas that eventually normalize at some point? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. Thanks Mike. So I think that the there are two areas we've been highlighting that I think you're starting to see more of a recovery already in eVestment, but eVestment certainly in 2020 had more of an impact. And I would say eVestment and Solovis, I should say together. The Investment Management community and the asset owners were also dealing with a lot of change, a very dynamic environment; they weren't sure whether this is going to be a sustainable market trend. And so they were, they really pulled back on buying decisions around any sort of analytical tools. So, but what we are seeing, as we've mentioned in the first quarter is that we maintain these conversations and relationships, we definitely, I think through our all-in pricing model that we've shifted to in 2019, really, it helped us actually retain a lot of clients in 2020. And therefore, now going into 2021, we're seeing that investment managers and asset owners are back in the market to really find ways to frankly manage these very dynamic portfolios. So and we've also done more to create a more all-in solution, particularly for asset owners across Solovis and eVestment. So we're seeing a lot of nice upswing now coming into 2021 off the back of a pretty impacted 2020. I think Market Tech, as we've mentioned, particularly the market infrastructure technology is the other area that's been impacted. And then across the rest of it, I would say that it's and actually I would say somewhat in the governance area, on the governance platform solutions. We -- it's harder; we do a lot of work there. But again, I think a lot of corporates we're dealing with downturns; we're dealing with a lot of challenges. And so it was a harder sales environment for that team as well, last year and we're starting to see some recovery there as well, but that would be another area where we hope that we would have more pickup in 2021 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: Great, thank you. Can you update us on how you're feeling about Verafin's backlog and outlook now that the acquisition is closed? And I believe this was a business that was growing around 30% prior to the acquisition, and is that kind of like a good bogey to be thinking about going forward?\nAdena Friedman: I can say that we ended 2020 on very much on plan and started 2021 very much on plan. So we're very pleased that I mean the business it's a great business, but it's also just a great team. And they're extremely focused. And I think that they're focused on the right path forward. So they're very much on plan with what we talked about when we announced the acquisition.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: All right. Great, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe also just on Verafin. Another one, just in terms of that revenue contribution run rate, I think you said, Ann, $19 million pro forma with the revenue recognition. So given that closed early to mid-February, should we be thinking about a core revenue number around that $35 million area for the second quarter just trying to gauge sort of the volatility or stability of that revenue stream. And then, Adena, if you talk about maybe thoughts around revenue synergies with being able to introduce the Verafin product and teams to the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, I know that's a long timeframe that will evolve over time, but maybe some thoughts about how you think that might progress and add to the Verafin revenue base?\nAdena Friedman: Sure, go ahead, Ann.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So I'll start on your first question, Brian. If you think about Verafin as we shared as part of closing the transaction and announcing a transaction, and estimated about $140 million in revenues -- in gross revenues before the purchase price adjustment. So we've provided the details on how the purchase price adjustment is going to play out over the year. If you take that $140 million and back out the purchase price adjustment, and then apply a proration based on February 11 close date. That's how you can think about what our expectations are at this point --\nAdena Friedman: For 2021.\nAnn Dennison: For 2021, sorry.\nBrian Bedell: For 2021, yes, okay.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. With regard to the longer-term, I have to say that we've already gotten off to a really, really great start in working with them and collaborating with them on client introductions and understanding where they want to focus on their sales activities. But they also are really, really focused on continuing to invest in R&D, invest in the business so that we can really become the preeminent Anti Financial Crime Technology provider to banks of all sizes, right, so the largest banks and the smallest banks. As we mentioned, when we announced the deal, and at closing, we do -- we will be working with them on to support their investments and certain things that certain technology capabilities that we have that we think that can be additive to their capabilities that can really make it to that as we go into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks we have just a -- Tier 2 banks -- we have just a fantastic solution for them. But that is, as you mentioned multiyear strategy. And so we've gotten a lot of inbound demand from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks to understand what the solution is and how it works. We're actually able to go in with some point solution sales into particularly Tier 2 banks that we think that are going to be relevant and allow us to lend and expand. And then we had or I should say Verafin had their first client sign up for to help them with some Fraud detection in a European Bank. So we're pretty excited about the fact that even just right on the heels of the acquisition, we're already seeing opportunities there. So we see a lot of good opportunities for us to collaborate with them that will support their growth rate over the longer term.\nBrian Bedell: It sounds great. Really good progress. Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Your line is open.\nSimon Clinch: All right. Thanks for taking my question. And I wanted to carry on with the topic of Verafin here, just because I think you've mentioned before that you fully expect at some point to be able to accelerate the revenue growth as you penetrate Tier 1 to 2, but I understood that it was a case of getting the product right for a particular market. And I'm interested that you just mentioned that Verafin have signed their first European Bank, it wasn't long ago, where you're still trying to tweak that product for the right market. So could you give us a sense of where you are in terms of the product readiness for Tier 1 and Tier 2 as it stands today?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I think that they certainly have seen really nice demand pickup in the what I would say $50 billion plus in assets, kind of banks that they continue to penetrate that that sector quite successfully. And they have an all-in full solution that really supports kind of a full platform for those banks. As they've been going in and starting to engage with $100 billion and plus type of banks, and really the large, the very large banks, they are finding opportunities to come in with a specific solution like a part of their offering. And that that they do have part of their offerings are quite relevant to the needs of those banks in terms of what I would call more of a like point solutions approach. So what we want to be able to do is become that all-in platform partner to those banks over time. So there may be some shorter term opportunities like we have at the European company to have a nice specific sale of a specific capability now that we're very, very good at. But then overtime I think that the real revenue opportunity will come if we can really build that out to become more of a holistic platform partner. So I just wanted to know, it's obviously very early days, there's a lot of enthusiasm, a great sense of partnership. And the ability for us to open doors but it will be it'll take time for us to get the solution and investment that we want to make in the business so that we can get that solution to become the preeminent platform across the entire industry.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. And just following on from that, could you walk us through sort of what the competitive environment looks like in that sort of fraud detection and financial crime space, it seems very fragmented to me. But I'm kind of curious, how are you just competing with really inefficient internal systems predominantly at the banks? Are there actually sort of legacy providers that you need to disclose?\nAdena Friedman: It's a combination of things. It is quite, it is actually quite a fragmented market. It's also a huge market opportunity, right. So you're talking about $12 billion of potential TAM, I think that we're positioned to be able to serve at least $6 billion to $8 billion of that TAM. So it's a huge market opportunity. It's a huge and growing problem. So I kind of equated in some respects, well, first of all, I think that there will be certain platforms that kind of emerge as the ones that the banks rely upon for all of their core work. And then there'll be point solutions and other innovations that come in on top of that, that we should be in a position either to acquire or integrate or partner with to make it so that we can continue to manage the dynamic needs of our clients. So I think that is the case. But there are some incumbents and I would say many are on-prem solutions that are not nearly as nimble or flexible, which is what I think Verafin has been very successful displacing in recent years, as well as a lot of internal build, particularly for the larger banks, the internal builds. And then at the very smallest end, there are a lot of small point solutions, providers that Verafin also competes very successfully against. And they've done a nice job of working with a lot of the more core banking platform providers to integrate Verafin into this platform, so that as our client is taking one of these core platforms, the banking platforms, they know that they have the benefit of Verafin as part of that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. We've seen a steady increase in equity trading in dark markets in off exchange. Does moving volume back on exchange rank in your priorities when communicating with the new leadership at the SEC? And if so what tools and approaches do you think make the most sense for regulators to consider should moving trading from the dark markets to the lid emerged as a top priority for them?\nAdena Friedman: Great. We're excited to have Gary Gensler coming to the role of Chairman, I think that it's great to have a leader within the SEC that really understands markets and market structure. So he is certainly a market structure expert. In terms of the priorities, I think on the back of some of the retail trading trends and hearings that happened in Washington, I do believe this will be a focus area for the SEC, and they're already working on a kind of a white paper, a thought piece around it, to go out and get comments and input from the industry. When it comes to part of that is, is a discussion of the dark trading, because when you look at the composition of the markets in the U.S., almost it's like 40% to 50% it's like I would say 45% or so of the trading today is done in the dark, and the vast majority of that is retail. So that means that the retail orders are not getting exposed to the lid exchanges, and they're not therefore contributing to price discovery. And therefore, then you have to sit there and say well, do we have the best reflection of price discovery if only half the market is being exposed and displayed? So I think, Ken, it is an area of focus for us. It's one of several things that we -- I think that the SEC and us and others will be focused on, as we look at how to continue to make market structure improvements. It's -- one of the great things about this business. Honestly, Ken, as you know, it's like an eternal learning curve. It's one of the things that keeps me so interested. And it's just fascinating to see how the markets evolve. But as we continue to evolve those markets, I think that some focused areas that we think will be important are to look at settlement cycles to see if we can go from two-plus-two to two-plus-one as well as to look at the margin calculation process and giving people a little bit more clarity as to the margin obligations. The second is on short sale disclosure. We do believe that that long positions are disclosed or positions are not and it just seems like an unfortunate asymmetry. And then the third is on market structure and trying to level the playing field between exchanges and off exchange players, but not in a way that's unnatural, but in a way that just allows us all to compete successfully. And, one of those examples would be tick size -- minimum tick sizes and minimum trade sizes and things like that. But that's one of several things that we would want to have the SEC consider.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I want to go back to Nasdaq private market. Could you please talk about how sustainable the activity is in NPM and then after Coinbase directly staying, how should we think about the role of NPM in the whole crypto space? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Great, hey, Owen. So NPM did have an outstanding quarter. And frankly, we had a really, really strong year in NPM last year, too. It really picked up in the second half, like the first half, particularly as we got into the pandemic became really slow. And then suddenly in the second half, we had a whole range of programs coming out, and it really -- activity picked up and gave us a great fourth quarter and now a great first quarter. I think that we should recognize that more and more companies are seeing -- more and more private companies are seeing NPM as a good way for them to manage long-term liquidity needs of their employees and investors without having to bring themselves to the public markets, or ahead of bringing themselves to the public markets where as you mentioned, with Coinbase having some of that liquidity done in the private markets ahead of time, kind of position them really well for their direct listing and gave them an investor base that they could walk into their listing with, in a way that was very sustainable and strong. And so I think that would be a good example of how companies I think increasingly are using the private markets as a kind of a lead in into a direct listing. And we see that as a really encouraging sign for our business and for the relationships we have at our companies. I think their crypto space; it's a good question, Owen, as to whether more crypto-oriented companies will be coming into the public markets on the back of Coinbase. And whether or not they also would choose that path. And if that's the case, then I think the Nasdaq Private Market is a natural way for them to manage that private liquidity ahead of an IPO.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow-up related to crypto, we're seeing a significant increase in institutional adoption and some large traditional financial players stepping into the space for the first time. I know, I think your technology is powering some crypto exchanges today. But just curious to hear whether you think there's an opportunity to eventually more directly participate in that space?\nAdena Friedman: Great, thanks. The way I look at the crypto markets and the overall cryptocurrency economy is that it's in a very -- it's still in a very early stage. And that's great, because I think we've seen this really elegant construct come into the ecosystem in terms of what the Blockchain and what you can do with it, you're seeing now some really interesting and tangible applications of it that have been more geared up until recently towards retail. But now you're starting to see institutional players recognizing that this is an construct that really could become part of mainstream commerce. So it's that classic product lifecycle that's really starting to develop and you're seeing where all the early experimentations turn to early businesses turned into proliferation of businesses now are turning into, I would say more concentrated but still very, very early, early lifecycle type of companies emerging. And so it does give us time for us to figure out the right path for us our -- as you mentioned, our initial involvement in crypto has been with our technology. And that's been really great. We are partners with several crypto markets on their surveillance and their technology bit and that's one of the big concerns with crypto has been around making sure that the markets are fair for all participants. And so our technology is highly relevant, they're managing trading and frankly, the scalability of trading that they've had to deal with. Our systems are designed for scale. So I think that that also really gives us some real advantage. And then we actually have launched with a partner, Crypto Index, and we've turned that into investable products outside the U.S. and we're hoping with a second partner to kind of hopefully bring that into the U.S. in coming months. So we do have some really interesting ways for us to participate in the crypto space. But we're still evaluating what should our long-term role be? And how will the markets evolve? And obviously, there are some great, great winners, including Coinbase, of course, in terms of developing the marketplaces of the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nKen Hill: Great, good morning. I had a question about ESG. Within your complex there, put up good 8% growth here, that seems to be above your targeted rate for corporate platforms. I know that's kind of overshadowed now, by the Listing services piece of it. But could you give maybe an outlook on ESG and how that's developing within Nasdaq and then maybe how that varies by geography as well, and what you would expect maybe here in the U.S. here over time? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, we're really encouraged by what we've been doing to develop at our ESG solutions. And again, it is early days. At the Investor Day, we gave a view that we would hope that these types of new ESG services that we've launched and products that we've launched would generate at least $50 million over five years. And so $50 million a year, five years later, sure, if you're clear. But I think that we obviously are quite encouraged by the fact that we've had some really great adoption of our ESG solutions by companies. We also have actually incorporated our ESG solutions into our IPO package now. So we'll get more and more companies adopting them and that gives us longer-term revenue opportunity with them as well. And we do obviously think that this is a trend that is here today. It's something that we believe will drive a lot of corporate decision making in the future, and we want to be that partner to the corporates to help them navigate this landscape. The business that we have launched and the services we offer are as popular in the U.S. as they are in Europe. So we already have, I would say we've had really good adoption of the products in the U.S. But in the Europe we've had, it's more mature. And so there's more. We've had more sustainable bond listings and other capital listings that also we support in Europe, in addition to helping our clients through standard setting and reporting, et cetera. So I think that it's an interesting dynamic space. And it's one we're quite encouraged by.\nOperator: Thank you. And that's all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn it back to Adena for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you. And thank you very much for your time today. We're very pleased to see our businesses delivering strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. You're guided by our strategic direction. We have a clear focus for the remainder of 2021, as we reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come and thank you and have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter 2021 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made executing on our strategy. I'd like to begin by acknowledging how deeply proud I'm of the Nasdaq team's continued commitment to our clients during this period. A full-year has now passed since our global workforce began working remotely and I could not be more pleased with the first quarter results that our team has delivered to our stakeholders today. Our relentless client focus and Nasdaq's nimbleness allowed us to generate strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. We also made important progress against our corporate strategy during the quarter with the completion of our acquisition of Verafin in February, and the announced agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business to Tradeweb Markets. Our performance during this period continues to underscore the resilience of Nasdaq's diversified product offering and business model as well as our ability to address the needs of our clients in a rapidly changing environment. Now I will turn to our strong financial results for the first quarter of 2021. Nasdaq delivered net revenues of $851 million, an increase of $150 million, or 21% from the prior-year period, driven by 17% organic growth in our Solutions segment businesses and 17% organic growth in our Market Services business. The acquisition of Verafin and the changes in FX rates drove the remainder of the growth for the business in the quarter. Across our exchange businesses, the incredibly dynamic capital markets environment during the period, combined with our strong competitive positioning, resulted in record U.S. equity and options volumes and a record quarter for new listings. I'm also extremely proud of the progress we've made to continue to grow our annualized recurring revenue or ARR which is up 21% compared to the prior-year period. This was driven by our continued focus on key secular growth opportunities that are powering our Solutions segments. We're seeing rising demand across our clientele for our solutions including from institutional investors for analytics and workflow tools, from corporate clients for our ESG and IR solutions, and from financial institutions and marketplaces for technology that helps reduce financial crime. Our ARR growth was also boosted by the acquisition of Verafin. The strong operating leverage of our model was evident in the results. Our non-GAAP operating margins increased to 54% up two percentage points compared to the prior-year. As a result, we experienced 25% increase in our non-GAAP operating income and a 31% increase in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the period. Turning now to the specific highlights from the quarter, I'll begin with our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses. Our Market Services segments total net revenues of $338 million, a 20% increase from the prior-year period and a new quarterly revenue record for this business. This was primarily led by higher U.S. options and cash equities trading volumes. We're also seeing an increase in demand for Trade Management Services connectivity solutions, as clients adjust their capacity for a wider range of volume scenarios. Nasdaq U.S. Options market set a quarterly record of 892 million contracts traded during the period, an increase of 57%. While our U.S. equities markets set a quarterly record of 153 million shares traded an increase of 20% year-over-year. Additionally, during the period, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our U.S. Fixed Income business NFI to an affiliate of Tradeweb Markets. The decision to sell NFI aligns with our strategy to maximize our potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. We expect the transaction to close later in 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Next, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenues of $155 million, a 21% increase with robust contributions across each of the product areas in that business. The business is boosted by record levels of new listing activity, material contribution from Nasdaq private market following a record first quarter for private company transactions and increased demand for our Investor Relations, Intelligence and ESG solutions. In our IR and ESG services business, we're seeing consistent and growing demand for our expanded suite of products, which has been carefully designed to help our clients' measure, analyze, collaborate and take positive actions regarding their respective Investor Relations, governance, and sustainability programs. For example, in our IR Intelligence unit, we saw six new client wins from our new expanded ESG advisory offering, a more in-depth solution that has lengthened and deepened our engagement with executive leadership teams as they seek to meet the demand from institutional investors and other stakeholders for greater clarity on their ESG strategies. And we're seeing this deeper client engagement results and continued sales momentum for our consultative IR advisory service and our Nasdaq IR insight workflow solutions, which saw a combined 36% increase in sales during the quarter. In our Listing segment, Nasdaq led U.S. exchanges for IPOs during the period welcoming 275 IPOs that raised $74.4 billion, including 79 operating company IPOs and 196 SPAC IPOs. The Nasdaq stock market led U.S. Exchanges with a 69% total win rate on IPOs, including a 77% win rate among operating companies, and a 66% win rate amongst SPACs. Listing highlights from the first quarter include the IPOs of Bumble, Qualtrics, Affirm, Playtika and Petco. During the quarter, Nasdaq listed seven of the top 10 largest IPOs by capital raised. Companies that responded positively to our virtual IPO experience during the pandemic period and we are excited and encouraged to see our iconic Bell ceremony and IPO day experienced come to life again in Times Square, and in cities across the country for our unique Remote Bell ceremony. Highlights include going on the road during the quarter to Bumble in Texas and to Qualtrics in Utah. We look forward to welcoming our clients and capital markets partners safely to the Nasdaq market site for these milestone celebrations as we start to prepare for a post-pandemic period. Of course, I also want to acknowledge the strong start to the second quarter in listings with in particular noting Nasdaq successful direct listing of Coinbase, a global leader in infrastructure and technology for the crypto economy. The Coinbase listing represents the largest direct listing in history, and was the largest ever Initial Public listing opening cross on Nasdaq. Now let me turn to our Market Technology and Investment Intelligence businesses. Our Market Technology segment delivered $100 million in revenues including a partial period contribution from the Verafin acquisition, which we completed in February. Our annualized recurring revenue for the quarter was a $416 million, a 62% increase year-over-year, including a 10% increase from our existing business and an additional $134 million representing the annualized total of Verafin's first quarter subscription revenues irrespective of the closing date, or the temporary impact of the write-down of deferred revenues. To give you more transparency and how different parts of Market Technology are operating and progressing going forward, we have started to report our revenues from this segment of our business in two groups. The first is called Marketplace Infrastructure Technology, which will comprise our solutions for the full trade lifecycle to market infrastructure operators, banks and brokers and non-financial market operators. And the second is called Anti Financial Crime Technology, our offerings providing surveillance, risk management, and Verafin's anti-money laundering and fraud detection solutions. As we stated in previous investor calls, there are certain areas of our Market Technology business that have been adversely impacted by the pandemic related factors largely in the Marketplace Infrastructure Technology business. And while the environment continues to be characterized by the logistical challenges to implementations and lengthened sales cycles, the actions we took last year to respond to those dynamics are resulting in stabilize but moderated revenue growth in the near-term, albeit with short-term impact to segment profitability. More importantly, our longer-term vision for Market Technology remains on track, as demonstrated by the progress we've been delivering in new sales and revenues from SaaS products and services, in particular, our Anti Financial Crime Technology Solutions. Excluding the impact of Verafin, SaaS revenues within all of Market Technology increased 15% year-over-year. Turning to our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered net revenues of $258 million, up $47 million or 22% from the prior-year period. Overall assets under management in ETPs benchmark to Nasdaq's indexes totaled $385 billion at the end of the quarter, an increase of 87% from the prior-year period, and a new quarterly record. Additionally, trading at futures and options on futures contracts tracking Nasdaq indexes, increased 31% year-over-year. I'm also pleased to see increasing adoption of some of our recent product innovations. In particular, AUM in the Invesco innovation suite built on their strong debut in the fourth quarter of 2020, and now stands at approximately $2 billion in AUM in just five months after launch, making this one of the most successful new launches for Nasdaq's Index business. Our analytics business delivered revenues of $48 million, an increase of $7 million, or 17% from the prior-year period. Led by eVestment and Solovis, this business experienced strong increased growth in the first quarter, due to improvement in both new users and retention compared to the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, new sales were up 23% from the fourth quarter of 2020, reflecting growth for our rebound in institutional investment industry demand following some temporary contraction in 2020, as well as increased realizations of the synergies between eVestment and Solovis as the combination help drive 28 new accounts to Solovis in the first quarter. These results underscore our strategy to create comprehensive workflow solutions for investment managers and institutional asset owners from pre-commitment diligence to post-commitment portfolio tracking and secondary trades. Lastly, within Investment Intelligence, our market data revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by expanding international demand for our proprietary data products. As I wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that Nasdaq remains diligently focused on serving the unique needs of our clients, while we advance our strategic mission to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead of us. At our Investor Day in November, we articulated that our diversified business model was designed to provide us with the resiliency to drive disciplined growth across a variety of backdrops. Our recent success, especially in the first quarter, underscores the power of the Nasdaq platform and highlights that the strategy underpinning a repositioned franchise is resonating with our clients, as we continue to reallocate capital to higher growth opportunities, while maintaining leadership in our marketplace core. This focus has also resulted in many new instances of dynamic collaboration across our businesses be it new product innovations or bringing advanced technology solutions to help our clients solve major industry challenges. For example, in our Anti Financial Crime Technology segment, we're very excited about the work that we can do together with Verafin. This includes the potential for new client opportunities given our strong relationships with Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, as the Verafin team continues to build out their solutions to increase confidence in the global financial system. Additionally, we're pleased to support their international expansion, especially into Europe where Verafin has just landed its first client. Another great example is the intersection of our listings and index businesses. Listing the next-generation of innovators, including many of the largest IPOs that have come to Nasdaq in the recent years, create strong synergies to drive new product development in collaboration with our Index business. For example, the strength and success of our Flagship Nasdaq 100 Index, and our partnership with Invesco, laid the groundwork for a recent launch of the Invesco Innovation Suite, including the Invesco Nasdaq Next Generation 100 ETF comprised of the 101st to the 200 largest non-financial companies listed on Nasdaq, the Nasdaq Next Gen 100 Index has been one of the fastest growing ETFs that we've ever launched with a partner and includes companies such as Etsy and Roku, as well as many of the fastest growing enterprise technology and healthcare companies listed on our market. As I look back at this quarter, I could not be prouder of the performance across the business. We officially celebrated Nasdaq's 50th anniversary in February and given our rich history as a technology pioneer, I remain confident that we are moving Nasdaq in the right direction for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ann to review our financial results in greater detail. Well, thank you. Well, I would say that we are -- we only changed our outlook for our growth rates or what I would say medium to long-term revenue growth rates about two quarters ago. So I'd say that, Rich, we're still -- we still believe that those are the appropriate way, the appropriate growth rates, at least based on a kind of a three to five year time horizon. But having said that, I do agree with you that we are performing well ahead of our outlook and we're obviously extremely pleased with that performance. I think that as we continue to gain more traction across our platforms, and particularly in the Solutions segment, we certainly can look to make those adjustments, but we're sticking with the outlook at this point. And we'll make some adjustments to that. And when we announced the Verafin acquisition, so we did make those adjustments as part of that announcement. Yes, really appreciate it. Thanks, Alex. Well, I think that really when you look at the revenue performance in the Listings business; it is on the back of three very strong years of new listings, which of course gets us to a new annualized recurring rate of Listing revenue. We had over I guess in 2019, we had a 189 IPOs. In 2020, we had over I think 314 IPOs. And then this year, already, we've had 275 IPOs. You are right though, with the SPAC Listings, it's a little different. They, first of all, they tend to come in at the capital market, because they want to pay the lowest possible fees. So contributions from SPAC if we look at an overall SPAC annual listing revenue is only about 5% of our total listing revenues. So it is a -- it's not a huge contributor. And of course, when they do combine with companies, then we have the opportunity to bring that company to Nasdaq as an operating company. And that tends to accrue to a higher fee rate. So there's a lot of opportunity from the SPACs as they make this combination to increase our revenue contribution. But it also is pretty limited risk in terms of if this SPACs are not able to find operating companies they want to combine with. But generally speaking, Alex, it's just I think it's kind of a compounding effect of multiple years where we've been -- we've been winning the majority of IPOs and frankly, the vast majority of operating company IPOs. And it's just been a favorable environment for us to be able to bring a lot of new companies to market. So I think it's a combination of all those things. And I should mention also, we had 32 new listings in the Nordics in the first quarter as well. And so that -- that -- that's really bucking the trend in Europe and we continue to see a lot of strength in our Nordics business as well. Great. Sure. Yes, on the Anti Financial Crimes side, it is largely a SaaS oriented business. There are -- so we think about what we put into Anti Financial Crime Sub Segment are the surveillance solutions to market. Some of those are still on-prem, but they're long-term licensed or licensed revenues, not a lot of project-related costs, because that's a pretty a more standardized service. Then you have the SaaS business related to the surveillance for our trading firms and it's all SaaS. And then you have the risk management solutions to both markets and broker dealers, and there that has both the combination of on-prem and SaaS solutions. And then lastly, you have Verafin which is entirely a SaaS business with very low professional fees. So generally speaking it's -- what you're seeing in the quarters is a relatively recurring element of kind of what the potential of the business is. As I mentioned before, we did have 10% growth in our Anti Financial Crime business, absent Verafin. So we continue to see really strong demand for all of those solutions. I think that in terms of the overall growth rate for Market Tech absent Verafin, as we mentioned, the Market Infrastructure Technologies part of the business has been more materially impacted by the pandemic, and we're still in a pandemic. So, we're still not able to go visit clients. These are generally in oftentimes particularly for new clients, these are large scale decisions that they're making, to have us partner with them to build and support them, and their core business technologies. So they tend to be sales cycles that resulting from relationships and it's harder to establish and manage those relationships if we can't visit our clients. So that is still the case, because of the pandemic. However, having said that our existing clients, they really spent last year focusing on managing the very high volume environment in a pretty dynamic capital markets environment as well. As they come into 2021, we are having more constructive conversations with them around thinking longer-term again, thinking about how they want to continue to advance their technology. So we're certainly seeing encouraging signs of working with our clients. But as I said in my comments, we would expect that the short-term growth rates on that part of the business would be -- will be moderated. And but over time, we're not changing our medium to long-term outlook on the overall business because we have confidence that will recover. Yes, sure. Thanks Mike. So I think that the there are two areas we've been highlighting that I think you're starting to see more of a recovery already in eVestment, but eVestment certainly in 2020 had more of an impact. And I would say eVestment and Solovis, I should say together. The Investment Management community and the asset owners were also dealing with a lot of change, a very dynamic environment; they weren't sure whether this is going to be a sustainable market trend. And so they were, they really pulled back on buying decisions around any sort of analytical tools. So, but what we are seeing, as we've mentioned in the first quarter is that we maintain these conversations and relationships, we definitely, I think through our all-in pricing model that we've shifted to in 2019, really, it helped us actually retain a lot of clients in 2020. And therefore, now going into 2021, we're seeing that investment managers and asset owners are back in the market to really find ways to frankly manage these very dynamic portfolios. So and we've also done more to create a more all-in solution, particularly for asset owners across Solovis and eVestment. So we're seeing a lot of nice upswing now coming into 2021 off the back of a pretty impacted 2020. I think Market Tech, as we've mentioned, particularly the market infrastructure technology is the other area that's been impacted. And then across the rest of it, I would say that it's and actually I would say somewhat in the governance area, on the governance platform solutions. We -- it's harder; we do a lot of work there. But again, I think a lot of corporates we're dealing with downturns; we're dealing with a lot of challenges. And so it was a harder sales environment for that team as well, last year and we're starting to see some recovery there as well, but that would be another area where we hope that we would have more pickup in 2021 and beyond. I can say that we ended 2020 on very much on plan and started 2021 very much on plan. So we're very pleased that I mean the business it's a great business, but it's also just a great team. And they're extremely focused. And I think that they're focused on the right path forward. So they're very much on plan with what we talked about when we announced the acquisition. Sure, go ahead, Ann. For 2021. Okay. With regard to the longer-term, I have to say that we've already gotten off to a really, really great start in working with them and collaborating with them on client introductions and understanding where they want to focus on their sales activities. But they also are really, really focused on continuing to invest in R&D, invest in the business so that we can really become the preeminent Anti Financial Crime Technology provider to banks of all sizes, right, so the largest banks and the smallest banks. As we mentioned, when we announced the deal, and at closing, we do -- we will be working with them on to support their investments and certain things that certain technology capabilities that we have that we think that can be additive to their capabilities that can really make it to that as we go into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks we have just a -- Tier 2 banks -- we have just a fantastic solution for them. But that is, as you mentioned multiyear strategy. And so we've gotten a lot of inbound demand from our Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks to understand what the solution is and how it works. We're actually able to go in with some point solution sales into particularly Tier 2 banks that we think that are going to be relevant and allow us to lend and expand. And then we had or I should say Verafin had their first client sign up for to help them with some Fraud detection in a European Bank. So we're pretty excited about the fact that even just right on the heels of the acquisition, we're already seeing opportunities there. So we see a lot of good opportunities for us to collaborate with them that will support their growth rate over the longer term. Yes. I think that they certainly have seen really nice demand pickup in the what I would say $50 billion plus in assets, kind of banks that they continue to penetrate that that sector quite successfully. And they have an all-in full solution that really supports kind of a full platform for those banks. As they've been going in and starting to engage with $100 billion and plus type of banks, and really the large, the very large banks, they are finding opportunities to come in with a specific solution like a part of their offering. And that that they do have part of their offerings are quite relevant to the needs of those banks in terms of what I would call more of a like point solutions approach. So what we want to be able to do is become that all-in platform partner to those banks over time. So there may be some shorter term opportunities like we have at the European company to have a nice specific sale of a specific capability now that we're very, very good at. But then overtime I think that the real revenue opportunity will come if we can really build that out to become more of a holistic platform partner. So I just wanted to know, it's obviously very early days, there's a lot of enthusiasm, a great sense of partnership. And the ability for us to open doors but it will be it'll take time for us to get the solution and investment that we want to make in the business so that we can get that solution to become the preeminent platform across the entire industry. It's a combination of things. It is quite, it is actually quite a fragmented market. It's also a huge market opportunity, right. So you're talking about $12 billion of potential TAM, I think that we're positioned to be able to serve at least $6 billion to $8 billion of that TAM. So it's a huge market opportunity. It's a huge and growing problem. So I kind of equated in some respects, well, first of all, I think that there will be certain platforms that kind of emerge as the ones that the banks rely upon for all of their core work. And then there'll be point solutions and other innovations that come in on top of that, that we should be in a position either to acquire or integrate or partner with to make it so that we can continue to manage the dynamic needs of our clients. So I think that is the case. But there are some incumbents and I would say many are on-prem solutions that are not nearly as nimble or flexible, which is what I think Verafin has been very successful displacing in recent years, as well as a lot of internal build, particularly for the larger banks, the internal builds. And then at the very smallest end, there are a lot of small point solutions, providers that Verafin also competes very successfully against. And they've done a nice job of working with a lot of the more core banking platform providers to integrate Verafin into this platform, so that as our client is taking one of these core platforms, the banking platforms, they know that they have the benefit of Verafin as part of that. Great. We're excited to have Gary Gensler coming to the role of Chairman, I think that it's great to have a leader within the SEC that really understands markets and market structure. So he is certainly a market structure expert. In terms of the priorities, I think on the back of some of the retail trading trends and hearings that happened in Washington, I do believe this will be a focus area for the SEC, and they're already working on a kind of a white paper, a thought piece around it, to go out and get comments and input from the industry. When it comes to part of that is, is a discussion of the dark trading, because when you look at the composition of the markets in the U.S., almost it's like 40% to 50% it's like I would say 45% or so of the trading today is done in the dark, and the vast majority of that is retail. So that means that the retail orders are not getting exposed to the lid exchanges, and they're not therefore contributing to price discovery. And therefore, then you have to sit there and say well, do we have the best reflection of price discovery if only half the market is being exposed and displayed? So I think, Ken, it is an area of focus for us. It's one of several things that we -- I think that the SEC and us and others will be focused on, as we look at how to continue to make market structure improvements. It's -- one of the great things about this business. Honestly, Ken, as you know, it's like an eternal learning curve. It's one of the things that keeps me so interested. And it's just fascinating to see how the markets evolve. But as we continue to evolve those markets, I think that some focused areas that we think will be important are to look at settlement cycles to see if we can go from two-plus-two to two-plus-one as well as to look at the margin calculation process and giving people a little bit more clarity as to the margin obligations. The second is on short sale disclosure. We do believe that that long positions are disclosed or positions are not and it just seems like an unfortunate asymmetry. And then the third is on market structure and trying to level the playing field between exchanges and off exchange players, but not in a way that's unnatural, but in a way that just allows us all to compete successfully. And, one of those examples would be tick size -- minimum tick sizes and minimum trade sizes and things like that. But that's one of several things that we would want to have the SEC consider. Great, hey, Owen. So NPM did have an outstanding quarter. And frankly, we had a really, really strong year in NPM last year, too. It really picked up in the second half, like the first half, particularly as we got into the pandemic became really slow. And then suddenly in the second half, we had a whole range of programs coming out, and it really -- activity picked up and gave us a great fourth quarter and now a great first quarter. I think that we should recognize that more and more companies are seeing -- more and more private companies are seeing NPM as a good way for them to manage long-term liquidity needs of their employees and investors without having to bring themselves to the public markets, or ahead of bringing themselves to the public markets where as you mentioned, with Coinbase having some of that liquidity done in the private markets ahead of time, kind of position them really well for their direct listing and gave them an investor base that they could walk into their listing with, in a way that was very sustainable and strong. And so I think that would be a good example of how companies I think increasingly are using the private markets as a kind of a lead in into a direct listing. And we see that as a really encouraging sign for our business and for the relationships we have at our companies. I think their crypto space; it's a good question, Owen, as to whether more crypto-oriented companies will be coming into the public markets on the back of Coinbase. And whether or not they also would choose that path. And if that's the case, then I think the Nasdaq Private Market is a natural way for them to manage that private liquidity ahead of an IPO. Great, thanks. The way I look at the crypto markets and the overall cryptocurrency economy is that it's in a very -- it's still in a very early stage. And that's great, because I think we've seen this really elegant construct come into the ecosystem in terms of what the Blockchain and what you can do with it, you're seeing now some really interesting and tangible applications of it that have been more geared up until recently towards retail. But now you're starting to see institutional players recognizing that this is an construct that really could become part of mainstream commerce. So it's that classic product lifecycle that's really starting to develop and you're seeing where all the early experimentations turn to early businesses turned into proliferation of businesses now are turning into, I would say more concentrated but still very, very early, early lifecycle type of companies emerging. And so it does give us time for us to figure out the right path for us our -- as you mentioned, our initial involvement in crypto has been with our technology. And that's been really great. We are partners with several crypto markets on their surveillance and their technology bit and that's one of the big concerns with crypto has been around making sure that the markets are fair for all participants. And so our technology is highly relevant, they're managing trading and frankly, the scalability of trading that they've had to deal with. Our systems are designed for scale. So I think that that also really gives us some real advantage. And then we actually have launched with a partner, Crypto Index, and we've turned that into investable products outside the U.S. and we're hoping with a second partner to kind of hopefully bring that into the U.S. in coming months. So we do have some really interesting ways for us to participate in the crypto space. But we're still evaluating what should our long-term role be? And how will the markets evolve? And obviously, there are some great, great winners, including Coinbase, of course, in terms of developing the marketplaces of the future. Sure. Yes, we're really encouraged by what we've been doing to develop at our ESG solutions. And again, it is early days. At the Investor Day, we gave a view that we would hope that these types of new ESG services that we've launched and products that we've launched would generate at least $50 million over five years. And so $50 million a year, five years later, sure, if you're clear. But I think that we obviously are quite encouraged by the fact that we've had some really great adoption of our ESG solutions by companies. We also have actually incorporated our ESG solutions into our IPO package now. So we'll get more and more companies adopting them and that gives us longer-term revenue opportunity with them as well. And we do obviously think that this is a trend that is here today. It's something that we believe will drive a lot of corporate decision making in the future, and we want to be that partner to the corporates to help them navigate this landscape. The business that we have launched and the services we offer are as popular in the U.S. as they are in Europe. So we already have, I would say we've had really good adoption of the products in the U.S. But in the Europe we've had, it's more mature. And so there's more. We've had more sustainable bond listings and other capital listings that also we support in Europe, in addition to helping our clients through standard setting and reporting, et cetera. So I think that it's an interesting dynamic space. And it's one we're quite encouraged by. Great. Thank you. And thank you very much for your time today. We're very pleased to see our businesses delivering strong organic revenue growth in the quarter. You're guided by our strategic direction. We have a clear focus for the remainder of 2021, as we reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow. I look forward to updating all of you on our progress in the months to come and thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior-year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter revenue performance as shown on Page 3 of the presentation and organic revenue growth on Pages 4 and 14. The $150 million increase in reported net revenue of $851 million is the net result of organic growth of $118 million including 17% organic increase in both Market Services and Solutions segments, a $14 million positive impact from acquisitions, and an $18 million impact from changes in FX rates. I will now review quarterly highlights within each of our reporting segments. I'll start with Investment Intelligence revenue which increased $47 million or 22%. Organic revenue growth during the period was 20%, reflecting very strong growth in our Index business, as well as strong contributions from both our market data and analytics businesses. Annualized recurring revenue or ARR was $542 million and increased 13% compared to the prior-year period. AUM and ETPs licensed to Nasdaq entities rose 87% year-over-year to $385 billion, including a 25% increase from net inflows and a 62% increase from changes in market impact. On Page 19 of the presentation you'll find our new disclosure on Net flow contribution to the year-over-year change in AUM. The segment operating margin of 65% increased one percentage point compared to the prior-year period. Market Technology revenue increased $19 million or 23%. The increase reflects organic revenue growth of $3 million or 4%, $12 million from the acquisition of Verafin which closed mid-quarter, and a $4 million impact from the changes in FX rates. Excluding a temporary $7 million purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue associated with the closing of the Verafin transaction, Verafin revenues would have totaled $19 million for the partial quarter period following the February 11, 2021 close. On 510, we showed a runoff of the remaining $23 million purchase price adjustments on Verafin's deferred revenue. The $3 million organic increase in Market Tech was driven primarily by higher SaaS based Anti Financial Crime Technology revenues, in particular from our Market and Trade Surveillance products. ARR for Market Technology was $416 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 62% compared to the prior-year period, largely due to the Verafin acquisition. Excluding Verafin, Market Technology ARR increased 10% in the period. In addition to the new Market Technology reporting Adena mentioned earlier, we're supplementing this with another revenue breakdown, disclosing the recurring subscription SaaS and support licensing revenues, as well as the non-recurring professional services contributions to help investors and analysts track our progress as we continue to expand the SaaS contributions across both our Market Infrastructure Technology and Anti Financial Crime Technology businesses. The segment operating margin was a negative 2%, but would have been a positive 5% when excluding the non-cash purchase price adjustment related to Verafin deferred revenue. The 5% margin is not a level that we believe reflects the potential of the business and we continue to feel optimistic about our ambition for a margin that supports Market Technology being a Rule of 40 business in 2023 and beyond. While the impact of the Verafin purchase price adjustment on deferred revenue is temporary, and will be eliminated over the next four quarters, on a core basis, two main factors will drive our margin expansion over the coming years. First, our mix of SaaS subscription revenues within Market Technology is increasing significantly. Looking ahead, we expect it to continue to grow as we execute our strategy. This is critical because our SaaS businesses have approximately two to three times the average contribution margin of the on-premise solutions. Second, we accelerated hiring in certain areas of our Market Technology business in recent quarters and on a temporary basis allocated more of our existing resources to relatively low margin installation work, in particular, in the most complex on-premise clearing solutions. We expect the margin impact to gradually diminish over the coming years. Corporate Platform revenues increased $27 million, or 21%. Organic revenue growth totaled $24 million or 19%. And there was a $3 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic revenue increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to an increase in IPOs and higher Nasdaq private market revenues together with an increase in both IR and ESG advisory services revenues. Nasdaq private market revenues were about $6 million to $7 million higher than the average quarterly run rate of 2020. And while this business has averaged an over 40% bigger in the last three years, we would expect to see at least $5 million in sequential decline in 2Q 2021 from NTM's particularly strong first quarter. Corporate Platform's ARR was $487 million and increased 12% compared to the prior-year period. The segment operating margin of 42% increased seven percentage points compared to the prior-year period, and was driven by both the unusually strong activity on the Nasdaq private market, as well as from the substantial increase in the listed issuer bid. Market Services net revenues increased $57 million, or 20%. The organic revenue increase was $48 million or 17% and there was a $9 million impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase during the period primarily reflects increases in cash equities and equity derivatives net revenues due to higher industry trading volumes and an increase in Trade Management Services revenues. The segment's operating margin of 67% increased four percentage points from the prior-year period, reflecting strong operating leverage on record trading revenues. Turning to Pages 9 and 14 to review expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $57 million to $393 million. The increase reflects a $24 million or 7% organic increase, an $18 million increase from the impact of acquisition, and a $15 million increase from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic growth and expenses reflects the sum of one, relatively consistent low-single-digit percentage increase related to hiring and wage inflation; two, higher compensation expense as variable performance linked compensation increase reflecting the company's outstanding growth; and three, costs related to what has been an incredibly active capital markets backdrop. For example, costs related to increasing our trading capacity, as well as marketing commitments supporting the extraordinary number of IPO wins in recent periods. Turning to Slide 10, we're narrowing our 2021 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.57 billion to $1.62 billion to reflect strong and broad-based organic revenue growth in the first quarter and the impact that growth had on variable expenses like performance-based compensation and marketing commitments. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, overall as performance continues to be strong, we would expect to come in at the high-end of the expense guidance range. In addition, we expect the year-over-year organic growth and expenses to be elevated particularly in 2Q 2021 compared to 2Q 2020 as the prior-year period had a significant reduction in travel and other in-office activity due to the onset of the pandemic, as well as lower new listing activity and less performance-based compensation due to the uncertain financial environment in 2Q 2020. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased $93 million in the first quarter of 2021. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 54% increased two percentage points year-over-year. Net interest expense was $28 million in the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $4 million compared to the prior-year period due to incremental interest expense related to the financing of the Verafin acquisition. Consistent with our reporting practice, interest expense related to acquisition financing that was incurred prior to the mid quarter close of the transaction was excluded from non-GAAP results for this quarter. And therefore, an incremental $3 million to $4 million of Verafin related interest expense will be reflected in the second quarter results. The non-GAAP effective tax rate was 24% for the first quarter of 2021, which includes a benefit related to the vesting of certain equity awards. For the full-year 2021, we still expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 25% to 27% and barring any changes in the corporate tax landscape, we expect to come in near the bottom end of the range for the year. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the first quarter of 2021 was $327 million, or $1.96 per diluted share, compared to $251 million, or $1.50 per diluted share in the prior-year period. Turning to Slide 11, debt increased by $349 million versus 4Q 2020, primarily due to net issuances of $435 million of commercial paper used to fund a portion of the Verafin acquisition, partially offset by an $87 million decrease in the book values of our Eurobonds caused by changes in FX rates. Our total debt to EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.4 times, a decrease from 3.5 times in the fourth quarter of 2020. During the first quarter of 2021, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $81 million, and repurchased common stock in the amount of $162 million. Today, we're announcing a 10% increase in the regular quarterly dividend to $0.54 per share. Additionally, during the first quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program of an additional billion dollars, subject to the closing of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, an acceleration of the issuance of Nasdaq common stock related to the sale. As previously communicated, we intend to use the proceeds from the sale as well as available tax benefits, working and clearing capital of the business and other sources to repurchase shares in order to offset EPS dilution. We continue to expect the sale to be temporarily 2% dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in the 12-month period following the close and we see immaterial dilution in periods thereafter. Overall, the actions taken during the first quarter support Nasdaq's accelerated evolution and allow the company to further concentrate its resources on technology, analytics and ESG opportunities. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure. So on your first question about Verafin's contribution, so within the numbers for the partial quarter, we had $12 million of revenues related to Verafin and so -- and that included $7 million worth of deferred revenue write-down. So on a gross basis, it was $19 million for the partial quarter, which we closed the deal on Feb 11. On your -- Related to your question in Market Tech margins, as we look forward to 2023 and our ambitions of achieving the Rule of 40 for the overall Market Tech. We think the primary way we can get there is through revenue growth, part of that will be bringing Verafin on board. And then the other two things are going to, we should look to; we're going to continue to expand our SaaS offerings. We talked about the growth in our SaaS business, and the fact that our SaaS businesses come at higher contribution margins. So as we continue to expand there, we'll see an impact on the margins. And then the last thing that I've mentioned is just that, we have -- we do have some incremental costs now to deliver on some of our larger, more complex projects. We've added costs and we expect them to gradually decline over time. So when you put those three things together, we expect to achieve that Rule of 40 in 2023. And I think it just brings back, it is important to note that we're confident in the prospects of this business and our ability to be successful here. Sure. So I'll start on your first question, Brian. If you think about Verafin as we shared as part of closing the transaction and announcing a transaction, and estimated about $140 million in revenues -- in gross revenues before the purchase price adjustment. So we've provided the details on how the purchase price adjustment is going to play out over the year. If you take that $140 million and back out the purchase price adjustment, and then apply a proration based on February 11 close date. That's how you can think about what our expectations are at this point -- For 2021, sorry."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Neil Stratton, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNeil Stratton: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line up to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial and business performance. The progress we have made to advance Nasdaq along our strategic journey, and our enterprise-wide ambitions and priorities for 2023 and beyond. I will also provide comments on the current market and regulatory environment before turning the call over to Ann for a deeper look at our financial results. We continue to deliver solid growth in 2022, even with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and following a very strong 2021. 2022 was also a year of milestones, strategic firsts and market-leading innovation for Nasdaq. I'm proud of the Nasdaq team and the resiliency of our business as well as the trusted relationships we have with our clients. Before I turn to our financial performance, I want to remind everyone about our new corporate structure that we implemented during the fourth quarter. When we gathered at our Investor Day in November, we noted how the alignment of our business across three new divisions, Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime, allows us to capitalize on mega trends shaping the financial system to unlock new growth opportunities for our company. These trends include the modernization of markets where we continue to deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying infrastructure, the development of the ESG ecosystem where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless routes to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives, and the increasing need for advanced anti-financial crime technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI. Our financial results today reflect the new divisional alignment, and we look forward to continuing our journey as we deliver world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy with our long-term goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system. Now let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. First, regarding the fourth quarter, Nasdaq achieved $906 million in net revenues, a 2% increase compared to the prior year period and a 5% increase on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. In the quarter, we delivered 5% organic growth across our Solutions businesses even with an 11% drop in our Index revenues. We also delivered 4% organic growth in our Trading Services business in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong trading performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year of 2022, net revenues of $3.58 billion increased 5% from 2021 and 7% on an organic basis. Our Solutions businesses generated 10% annual organic revenue growth despite a fast-changing market environment, and our Trading Services revenues increased 1% on the back of very strong performance in 2021. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Annualized SaaS revenues increased 13% to $725 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing 36% of total company ARR. For the full year, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.66 increased 6% from 2021. Our strong performance in 2022 against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop illustrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives. Next, I'm going to turn to specific divisional highlights, which reflect the new corporate structure, focusing mainly on the fourth quarter results. In our Capital Access Platforms business -- division, we delivered $420 million in total revenue in the fourth quarter, a 2% increase in organic growth. Revenue in our Data and Listing Services business increased by 3% from the prior year period and 6% organic growth. primarily due to an increase in annual listing fees and growth in proprietary data revenues driven by higher international demand, partially offset by a decrease in initial listing fee revenues. In 2022, Nasdaq maintained its position as the leading U.S. exchange for IPOs for the 10th consecutive year with 87 operating company listings for a 92% annual win rate. In Europe, our Baltic, Nordic and First North exchanges combined welcomed 63 new listings in 2022, including 38 IPOs. For the second consecutive year, Nasdaq Stockholm remains the most successful listing venue in Europe. In our Index business, we saw revenue decrease by 11% versus the prior year period, primarily due to lower average AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indices, partially offset by higher revenues related to futures trading linked to the NASDAQ 100 Index. Year-over-year average AUM for the fourth quarter declined by 19%. The fourth quarter presented a particularly challenging market backdrop on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Ann will provide more details on the AUM and trading dynamics that drove the fourth quarter revenue decline. Focusing on the full year performance, our Index revenues for the full year of 2022 increased 6% versus 2021 due to higher net inflows and futures volumes. Net inflows into exchange-traded products totaled $34 billion in 2022, and we saw demand grow for our new offerings with 44 ETPs tracking Nasdaq indexes, accumulating $3.5 billion in AUM during the year. In our Workflow and Insights business, which include our Corporate Solutions as well as our Investment Analytics business, our fourth quarter revenues increased 8% from the prior year period or 10% organically, reflecting deepened client engagement and strong client retention. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $403 million in total revenues in the fourth quarter, a 3% increase from the prior year period or 5% organic growth. Our Trading Services business, which includes our transactional and U.S. Tape Plan data businesses, delivered combined total revenue of $253 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% organically from the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives trading revenues, reflecting higher revenue capture versus the prior year period and higher industry volumes. Cash equities trading revenues were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by lower European cash equities revenue, partially offset by modest growth in the U.S. cash equities business. During the fourth quarter, we were incredibly pleased to announce the migration of Nasdaq MRX, 1 of our 6 U.S. options exchanges, to the cloud in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The new cloud-enabled system delivers -- continues to deliver ultra-resiliency to our market participants while improving latency performance by 10%. As the first exchange to put a major market in the cloud, this marks a significant milestone in our journey to build the next-generation technology infrastructure for the world's capital markets. This success has also reinforced our credibility with our technology clients. As illustrated by Bolsa Electronica de Chile's agreement earlier this month to migrate their current on-premise Nasdaq trading technology to our cloud-based marketplace services platform. We are thrilled that BEC has chosen us to help manage this next phase of their cloud journey. And lastly, in our Marketplace Technology business, we delivered $150 million in revenues during the fourth quarter, of 5% increase versus the prior year period. Growth in revenue was primarily due to increased demand for connectivity, driving a record year for our Trade Management Services business as well as higher SaaS-based market technology revenues. Order intake in our Market Technology business totaled $106 million for the quarter and $264 million for the full year, which compares to a record of $304 million in 2021. We had strong order intake across both existing and new clients with over 90% of our new clients signing up for SaaS solutions, an encouraging indicator of growth returning to the technology business post pandemic. We signed 12 new technology clients and completed five implementations in our Market Technology business in 2022. We continue to make good progress with our post-trade implementations, taking two of our largest clients into live operation during the year. Over the past 18 months, we've seen increased demand for our technology solutions with many current and new client conversations focused on market modernization initiatives encompassing both cloud delivery and SaaS. Before I conclude my remarks regarding our Market Platforms division, I want to offer brief comments here on the SEC's equity market structure proposals, which the commission published in December of 2022. We're encouraged that the proposals addressed many of our recommendations from a paper that we published last year on optimizing markets. While we believe that the equity markets work well now, we acknowledge that there are always opportunities for improvements. Accordingly, we support the SEC's efforts to modernize and enhance equity market structure to improve trading efficiency, bolster competition, increase market transparency, strengthen best obligations and ultimately, achieve better outcomes for investors. In proposing to introduce significant changes to markets that are already highly complex and interconnected, we think it is critical for the commission to strive to avoid unintended consequences by proceeding incrementally, methodically and collaboratively. There are also a few areas where we differ with the SEC's approach, and we plan to recommend improvements, modifications and or alternatives during the comment period. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $82 million in total revenue during the fourth quarter, a 21% organic increase from the prior year period and 14% when adjusting for the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The revenue increase was driven by strong demand for our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions or what we call our FRAML solutions in addition to modest growth in our surveillance solutions. Regarding our FRAML solutions specifically, revenue grew 23% when adjusting for the impact of deferred revenue in the prior year period. The business saw continued growth in new clients across small to medium banks with 98 new SMB clients signed during the quarter. In addition, the business signed its first two clients to its crypto anti-financial crime platform in 2022. This is an exciting offering that allows crypto companies to identify crime, ensure regulatory compliance and prevent losses. We also continue to see momentum following several proofs of concepts with a number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, including signing a Tier 2 bank for our enterprise fraud solution during the fourth quarter. Feedback on the proof-of-concept results has been very positive, and we anticipate signing additional clients in 2023. I want to take a moment here to acknowledge our leadership appointment that took place this month in our Anti-Financial Crime division. Brendan Brothers, a co-founder of Verafin and the division's Head of Strategy, has been appointed interim Head of our AFC division. He succeeds Jamie King, who's retiring from Nasdaq. We're grateful for Jamie's tremendous contributions to Verafin, and we wish him very well in his next chapter. And we're excited to have Brendan step in to his role as we continue to execute against our AFC road map. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks today, Nasdaq has made notable progress against our broader strategic journey. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2023 and beyond. First, we will strive to realize the benefits of our new divisional alignment. We aim to unlock the growth opportunities that our new structure provides us. We intend to deliver an enhanced client experience by delivering more unified solutions through a One Nasdaq approach to our clients. We will have a focused capital allocation strategy across our three divisions, and we will increase our go-to-market agility by integrating related software development and marketing talent into each division, which would facilitate streamlined decision-making. Second, we want to remain positioned for success amid a dynamic market environment. With macroeconomic uncertainty likely to persist as we continue into 2023, we want to demonstrate the value of our mission-critical solutions in an environment where businesses know that they need to keep investing but are increasingly focused on quick time to value and strong return on invested capital. And third, we want to continue advancing our long-term cloud and AI strategy across the Nasdaq franchise by optimizing our agile development and leveraging machine intelligence across our solutions to unlock more opportunities to deliver innovation to our clients. Within market platforms, as we deploy our new data-centric system architecture, combined with the scalability and the analytics engines that are offered through the cloud infrastructure, we believe we'll be able to develop new AI-based order types and we'll offer more advanced capabilities to our market participants connected into our ecosystem. These capabilities will also become available to our exchange technology clients as we work collaboratively with them to deploy cloud-based market infrastructures in their home markets. Beyond market platforms, we're already well positioned with our cloud-based SaaS solutions across many of our solutions businesses, and we're on our journey to bring more of our solutions into the cloud. In 2023, we're currently migrating our clients onto our next-gen cloud-based governance platform and trade surveillance platform. As our anti-financial crime solutions demonstrate, having a cloud-based data lake unlocks enormous potential in applying advanced AI algorithms and self-reinforcement learning engines to our solutions. And with new step function improvements in AI that are coming to market, we're extremely excited to apply those technologies to more of our solutions in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities in the quarters to come. Before I wrap up, I would like to address the current market environment. Uncertainty still lingers across the global economy and market-driven headwinds. And if they persist throughout the year, that could impact our near-term growth outlook across listings and index in 2023. We are also seeing a modest elongation of sales cycles for certain of our solutions, notably our IR solutions and our asset owner solutions, which is part of our Analytics business. We are viewed by our IR and asset owner clients as a trusted partner to help them manage through the challenges that the markets have presented. But we are finding, particularly in more hard-hit sectors, that clients are going through more internal gates to approve investments in IR and portfolio management solutions. More generally, across our broader Nasdaq platform, client demand remains strong. Despite the macro uncertainty, we believe 2023 will be marked by how well businesses continue to adapt to the digital transformation of the economy through investments in technology. Nasdaq benefits from that digital transformation given our range of technology and analytics solutions. Building on our foundation of solid client retention, competitive success and deepened engagement with clients, we have confidence that our clients' investments in technology and cloud-based SaaS solutions will continue to be a priority. Therefore, we maintain our conviction in the investments we're making to deliver modern world-class solutions to our clients. We have a very resilient and diversified value proposition and are well prepared to guide our clients and our companies through this dynamic environment. We are entering the year with a continued focus on achieving our revenue growth outlook over the medium term as we navigate a complex 2023, and we remain confident that our longer-term investments across market modernization, ESG solutions and anti-financial crime technology will create value for our clients and shareholders alike. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2022 for our company. Looking ahead in 2023, we enter the year focused on realizing the benefits of our new corporate structure to amplify growth across our key pillars of liquidity, transparency and integrity as we look to advance towards our goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in the file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. As a reminder, on Slide 4, our financial reporting reflects the new corporate structure that we announced last quarter. Additionally, in order to better align our financial reporting with our internal management structure, we also recast the U.S. cash equity and options tape plan revenues into the Trading Services business within Market Platforms division from the Data and Listing Services business within the Capital Access Platforms division. Investors can review an updated supplement on the IR website with historical time periods reflecting this change. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter 2022 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $906 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 4% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 49% was down from 51% in the prior year period. For the full year 2022, the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 52%, a decrease of 1 percentage point from 2021. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $317 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $328 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $725 million, an increase of 13%. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15, starting with the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $10 million or 3%. The organic increase was 5%, and there was a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services' organic growth totaled 4% with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives and U.S. cash equity revenues due to higher capture and higher industry volumes, partially offset by lower European cash equity revenues due to lower industry volumes. Within marketplace technology, we had strong performance in our Trade Management Services business and delivered another quarter of organic growth in the Market Technology business, driven by higher SaaS revenues and strong order intake during the period. This builds on the positive organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022 and, is a further encouraging proof point that the programs and initiatives implemented by the leadership team are moving the business forward. ARR totaled $503 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 52% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 54% in the full year of 2022 both decreased 2 percentage points from the prior year period. The change primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses, including our digital asset strategy. Capital Access Platform revenues were unchanged, reflecting organic revenue growth of $7 million or 2% as well as a 2% negative impact of changes in FX rates. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the Workflow and Insights and Data and Listing Services businesses, partially offset by an organic decline in Index revenues. Spending a moment on Index. Overall Index revenue declined by 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. When examining the key drivers of the financial performance, our asset-based licensing revenues declined 21% compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a 25% increase in futures-related revenues linked to the NASDAQ 100 Index. Average AUM during the period, which is used to calculate our asset-based revenues each quarter, decreased 19% from the prior year period and trading volumes in futures linked to the NASDAQ 100 index increased 21% from the prior year quarter. To assist analysts and investors going forward, we are updating our public disclosures to provide average AUM each quarter in addition to the end of the period, which will be -- which will better align our key disclosures with our key revenue drivers for the business. One additional note looking forward to the first quarter of 2023. Trading activity of instruments linked to our indexes achieved certain annual thresholds during the second quarter of '22 that resulted in an increase in licensing economics during the remainder of the year. As we begin 2023, the economics of certain agreements reset for the new year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $9 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 50% in the fourth quarter decreased -- the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased 3 percentage points from the prior year period. The operating margin for the full year 2022 was 54.4%, up 60 basis points from 53.8% in 2021. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 21%, with $4 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in 4Q '21. Organic growth was 21% in the period or 14% when excluding the impact of deferred revenue, reflecting healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to 4Q '21, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $312 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $338 million, an increase of 17% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 32% in the fourth quarter of '22 and 26% in the full year of '22. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $26 million to $460 million. The increase reflects a $45 million organic increase, partially offset by a $20 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expense. The higher compensation reflects our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 10% increase in the team over the past 12 months; and annual merit increases, which were higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation. The higher general and administrative expense primarily reflects higher travel versus the prior year period as we returned to a more normalized level of travel in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of our new corporate structure. As a reminder, we did this to focus our business more sharply on three megatrends: modernizing markets, ESG and anti-financial crime. The structure change not only increases our focus but will also bring commercial teams closer together, put technology and marketing resources closer to our products and redefine how we engage, attract and retain clients across products. As a result, we expect to incur $115 million to $145 million in pretax charges, approximately 40% of which will be non-cash charges. The program will be open for two years and has three main components: one, asset impairments and contract terminations; two, employee-related costs to support the divisional realignment; and three, onetime consulting and other spend designed to help us unlock revenue synergies. We are targeting benefits in the form of combined annual run rate operating efficiencies and revenue synergies of at least $30 million by 2025. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as restructuring expense. We are initiating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.77 billion to $1.85 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range reflects an increase of just over 5%, including an increase of 1% related to our digital asset strategy and primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, anti-financial crime and market modernization. We expect the 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 17. Debt increased by $27 million versus 3Q '22, primarily due to net issuances of $465 million of commercial paper and $164 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro, partially offset by repayment of $600 million of 0.445% senior unsecured notes at maturity. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio remains at 2.7 times as compared to the third quarter of 2022. With record free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees of $1.5 billion in 2022, our weighted average cash cost of debt of 2.2% and no long-term debt maturities until 2026, we have positioned the company to minimize the impact of rising rates and to provide flexibility to support our growth strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. As of December 31, 2022, there was an aggregate $650 million remaining under the Board-authorized share repurchase program, reflecting an increase in authorization approved by the Board in December. Turning to Page 18 of the presentation. I would like to highlight some of the significant progress we have made, executing on our sustainable strategy. For the seventh consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, one of the most prestigious environmental, social and governance ranking benchmarks. Nasdaq was 1 of 8 diversified financial services companies selected for inclusion in the 2022 index. In addition, we were only -- 1 of only 283 companies out of 15,000 evaluated and named to CDP's 2022 Climate Change A list. In closing today, Nasdaq's fourth quarter of 2022 results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, good morning, Adena, and good morning, Ann. I didn't quite get those restructuring charges, but I think I'd like to keep my question broader. Adena, you talked right at the conclusion in your prepared remarks about sort of the outlook for '23. And I think we all get if the markets are down, the index business, the listing business, et cetera. But I'm trying to see what businesses might flourish, or is there any businesses that might make progress if we get -- with this macroeconomic uncertainty? Because investors look at exchanges to be a little bit countercyclical. And right attached with that, that this sort of outlook, I know it's early on, but the Reg NMS changes, just on balance, they're not going to happen this year. But if they -- the whole balance, whether the fee -- cap fees versus the higher volumes, how you look at the balance from the proposed changes.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Okay. So that was a good long and multi-pronged question, Rich.\nRichard Repetto: You can just take one. I apologize. Just take one.\nAdena Friedman: That's okay. No, no, that was good. Okay. So in terms of outlook for 2023, I think the general view inside of Nasdaq right now is that we continue to have really strong client interactions across all the businesses that comprise our annualized recurring revenue. So that's our Anti-Financial Crime business, our -- what we call our Corporate Solutions business, our investment analytics capabilities and particularly in our analytics and our data businesses and in our Marketplace Technology business. We still see really good client demand, client interactions, progress against our strategy. I feel our ESG services had double-digit growth and we continue to see really great capabilities and opportunities there. Our anti-financial crime technology continues to show really strong growth. And I think that the market modernization efforts are really impact -- having a positive effect on our engagement with our market tech clients as they're thinking about modernizing their infrastructure. So what I would say, the long-term trends that we're really driving towards feel good as we go into 2023, and we feel really great about the client engagement. The market backdrop, obviously, we're not immune to it. No company is. But I would agree that exchanges have a really resilient -- we're a resilient platform because we have this underpinning of trading, we have this underpinning of our listings and listing fees. We have an underpinning of data that really help keep us really strong and quite resilient in -- across all different market environments. But there are a couple of areas where we have market beta. So certainly, listings revenues won't grow as fast if we don't have listings come out to the market. We have 200 companies on file looking to tap the NASDAQ and hopefully, if the markets open up as we go through the year. But as you know, it takes 2 to tango. So we've got the supply the demand really comes for investors feeling confident underwriting new deals. And I think if we can see interest rates kind of top out and we kind of know where that ends up, we see inflation continue to come down and we have a more certain economic underfooting, we could actually see activity pick up, particularly in the latter half of the year. And we're hopeful for that. And that will help, obviously, with '23 growth but also help with '24. I think with the Index business, it's obviously subject to market beta with our AUM. And we were able to withstand a lot of changes in market values last year. But the fourth quarter, you could see, had a big impact. So the AUM dropped a lot. We didn't have as robust inflows in the fourth quarter to counteract that. But as we go into 2023, we're leased off to a better start. We'll have to see how that evolves, and that's an area where we will have market data through the year. So we'll have to see that goes. But if I were to sum it up, though, the areas where we have recurring revenues and we have our SaaS revenues, we feel really good about how we're engaging with clients. We do have some elongated sales cycles across IR and analytics. But generally speaking, really strong demand. The trends that we're underwriting, we feel really good about and investments we're making there. And I think the markets will be the markets, but I think we've been able to demonstrate really strong performance across different market cycles. Lastly, you asked a question about Reg NMS and the fees and volumes. It's really early, Rich. It's an initial proposal from the SEC. There'll be rounds of comments, there'll be probably revisions in the proposals. And so it will be several years before we kind of see the impact of that. But you're doing the same tactics that we're trying to do, which is we see more opportunity to bring more retail volume onto lit venues, and that's obviously going to benefit us. But we also see a change in the tick sizes and the relevant access fees, and that's where we have to kind of look at that, the kind of what I'll call the different dynamics that that will result in. And so we actually kind of net-net are generally positive on what the SEC's proposed. But we obviously want to make sure we're calibrating the tick sizes and the access fees appropriately for what they're trying to achieve there.\nRichard Repetto: Thank you.\nOperator: And I show, we have our next question from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. And thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit on Verafin. I was hoping you can update us on how the sales environment and pipeline is evolving. And you mentioned some proof of concepts that are undergoing right now. I was hoping maybe you can elaborate on how many you have with Tier 1 banks, and historically, what's been the time to conversion with those historical clients signing over to becoming paying customers? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So generally, if we look at all of AFC, so you've got anti-financial crime, so you've got the FRAML business which is kind of the Verafin capabilities, and then you have our trade surveillance, which is really the surveillance technology we offer to trading firms and we have market surveillance, which is the technology -- the surveillance technology we offer to markets. In Verafin, as I mentioned, we continue to see really nice strong demand there, and client -- especially with small and medium banks, the conversion has been quite consistent, finding a lead to getting them to become paying clients. And we had, I think it was 98 new clients in the quarter. And we had really strong dynamics there. And it's -- I have to say, I think what we offer is a great product and it shows up in the sales. As we go upmarket, that's where we're kind of -- we, as Verafin, are facing some new unchartered waters, right? We're getting up to the top of the top of the banking universe. And I think that what we're seeing is Tier 2 banks, we're getting them signed up and lined up slowly but surely. The proof of concepts are showing a significant reduction in false positives and a better ability to identify real fraud. And so I think that's really -- the proof points are really helpful in getting to convert a client. Tier 2 banks, you're talking more like a, I would say, anywhere from a 6 to 12-month sales cycle there. And then you get up to the large Tier 1 banks. And that's where, again, we have several proofs of concepts that are completed now, and I think that we're showing really strong results in terms of improvements in lower false positives, better fraud detected. But the contracting cycles there are really long because they go through a really deep review internally. We go through, obviously, cyber review. We go through a lot of different things. And those sales cycles can be anywhere from, I would say, kind of 9 to 15 to 18 months. So we are really hopeful because we completed some of those proof of concepts in the first half of last year that we should be able to convert them this year. And I can only say, Michael, we're not giving specific numbers, but it's a good number of proof of concepts that we've completed. It gives us an opportunity to show that we can get into the Tier 1 banks as we go through '23. And so we're confident we'll be able to show those proof points as we go through the year.\nMichael Cyprys: Thank you.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Kramm: Yes, good morning, everyone. This may be a little bit of a snippy question but I'm going to ask it anyways. It's about the recast. So obviously, you just in November resegmented and rolled out new targets for solutions 7 to 10. But then obviously, you just recast something today to basically move a no or shrinking business into the non-solution segment. So if my math is right, it's about 60 basis points of positive impact to organic growth to Solutions in the fourth quarter. So I guess my question is, should we hold you accountable for higher targets now? Was it 7.5% to 10.5%? Or how should we be thinking about it? Because, again, you did a nice job recasting and really moving Solutions to be non-trading, and now you're changing that around again? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So Alex, thanks for the question and it's not snippy. So -- but I would say this. We actually made that change, so what happened was we used to have the options tape revenue sitting inside the Market Services business, and we have the equities tape revenue sitting inside of Market Data. And -- but what we did with the realignment was we actually moved the management of the equities tape into the Markets team because of the fact that the revenues associated with the equity tape are more -- they ebb and flow with market share and other dynamics in the market as opposed to just pure client demand. And so we decided, and so when we first redid -- went into the new divisional alignment, we actually moved the options tape into data as opposed to moving the equity tape into the markets. And we -- as we went through the fourth quarter and we really thought about kind of aligning the business with the management, we actually decided to make a switch. So we kind of moved the options and equities tapes now into market platforms because that's where the team that supports them are moving into the Market Platforms division, are being managed by the Market Platforms team. So we did not do it intentionally to kind of recast targets or anything like that. We're not changing our medium to long-term outlook across our Solutions businesses. 7% to 10% is the target and the outlook that we expect to be able to achieve over medium to long term. But we did want to move those products just into the group that's managing them. That's really the only catalyst.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So on the expense outlook, could you please talk about the area that you will invest in ESG and Anti-Fin Crime? Is there any specific examples you can give to us? And how should we think about the new product launches or even incremental revenue potential from these investments? Thank you.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. I'll start. Hi Owen. So when we think about -- I guess, just coming back to the guidance, we've got that midpoint of our guidance is at 5%, which is when you look at our 4% to 7% medium-term outlook, we're just below the midpoint of that which would be 5.5%. When we think about what comprises that 5%, substantially all of our growth is to support, like you said, the -- our growth initiatives across ESG, AFC and market modernization. And I would characterize them as the investment we need to continue building out the long-term opportunities for those business to support the revenue growth we have in our outlook over the medium term. And so I think it's really about that 18% to 23% medium-term outlook on AFC and then our capital access platform medium-term outlook to support the growth there, ESG being the biggest or a high -- growing off a small base but a high-growing portion of the Workflow and Insights portion of the business.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I think, Owen, one thing we did point out because embedded in that 5% annual growth in expenses is about, 1 percentage point of that is really the continued investment we're making in our digital assets business. As we kind of get closer to launching that business, hopefully in the first half of this year. So that's one concentrated investment that we've called out as we went through and discussed the outlook. I think beyond that, when we look at the remaining 4% growth, as Ann said, the majority of that growth really just comes from making sure we're making the right investments across the three key pillars. We're not kind of quantifying investments in each one of those pillars. But they're all -- you have to think about it this way. The growth outlook of one of those businesses, if there's a higher growth outlook, it's likely that we're putting more investment dollars or at least on a percentage basis, putting more investment into those businesses. So like our AFC business. If we have a medium to long-term growth outlook of 18% to 23%, we're investing in the R&D and the go-to-market and the sales capabilities to make sure we support that growth. And so that would have a higher level of investment than something that's growing 5%, let's say. But I also think that -- as a general matter, we feel like we're making the right choices of where to invest our capital to make sure we can sustain our growth and make sure we achieve this on the medium to long-term outlook.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. So I had a question on the pretax charges from the divisional alignment. I was wondering if you could provide more detail behind the employee-related costs. And what does this really mean in sort of simple terms? Is it layoffs, new hires? And where are you increasing headcount and where are you potentially reducing headcount?\nAnn Dennison: Okay. Thanks, Craig. I can get started on that question. So if we think about just overall the realignment program that we've launched, the objective of the program is really tied very, very closely to our restructure of the -- and realignment of the divisions themselves. So when you think about the employee costs that are embedded in that range of $115 million to $145 million, they're really complementing our divisional realignment and not broad-based. We're not looking at anything sort of from a broad-based company perspective, but really the effect of looking at location and functional strategy within the alignment of the divisions. And then also migrating some of our tech to optimize the power of the combined divisions. And we think about those costs coming in over the next two years and with an expected return on those costs of an annualized run rate savings and revenue synergies of about $30 million a year sort of fully baked in by 2025. And I'd say that $30 million estimate, right now, the majority of that is on the expense side.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDanFannon: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the Anti-Fin Crime. The 14% growth ex the deferred revenue this quarter, trying to bridge that to the 3 to 5-year outlook of 18% to 23%, and you've clearly talked about a lot of momentum. But is in the -- but the long sales cycles, do you need -- should we think about 2023 as being within this, the higher end? Or is it going to ramp as we kind of get and maybe exiting that -- exiting '23 or beyond to get to those higher numbers?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I think that as we look at our kind of our medium- to long-term outlook, that 18% to 23%, we feel is well supported by the sales opportunities, the pipeline and the overall continued investment in the actual products so that we can continue to expand our capabilities. I thought I'd give you just a little bit more detail on how we look at the dynamics. And I mentioned -- as I mentioned before, we have our FRAML solutions. And that obviously, that's our Verafin asset, and that was delivering more than 20% growth in the quarter and continues to have really strong growth potential even as it continues to scale. And so I think there, Dan, we definitely think that the Tier 1, Tier 2 -- we're not dependent on Tier 2 and Tier 1 banks to support that growth rate in the short term. But as we continue -- as we move upmarket and we are able to attract this Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, the ticket sizes are much, much higher. So over the longer term, showing momentum across that will be important to continue to maintain the strong growth trends that we're showing in that business. The other two parts of the business, trade surveillance, that continues to have kind of high single-digit, low double-digit growth, and it has for a long time. That's providing surveillance solutions to trading firms. And there, we're continuing to drive that growth by expanding the types of modules that we offer, like our crypto modules as well as more -- bringing more asset classes onto the platform and really continue to globalize the clientele there. We have gotten to the point where we become an enterprise provider of surveillance across large banks, and that continues to be a good growth opportunity to support that kind of high single digit, low double digits. The one area that is actually has a low -- I would say flat to low growth profile is our market surveillance business where it's the smallest part of the division. But it's a harder one to grow a lot because the overall base of client opportunities is smaller. That's where we provide surveillance to markets and regulators. And there, that business was largely flat for the year and continues to have a low growth profile. So that's -- I think certainly in 2022, that has created a little bit of kind of a lower growth view. And as we go into '23 and '25 or '23 to '24, '25, '26, we hope to find new ways to catalyze some growth there, but we will expect that to be a low grower in the years to come. So hopefully, that just gives you a little more context.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one confirmation just on the divisional alignment program, the $115 million to $145 million. I just want to make sure that's those expenses are not included in the non-GAAP guidance. So just a clarification on that. And then more broadly, just in terms of the Solutions growth for this year, I realize 7% to 10% remains your longer-term target. But given the headwinds that you're describing this year from the elongated sales cycles and of course, the pressure on index licensing, should we be thinking of a near-term 2023 as being sort of lower than that? And then the initiatives that you're investing in would potentially then raise that in '24? So kind of a slowdown and then a reramp of that Solutions revenue.\nAnn Dennison: Sure, Brian. So on the first part of your question, the divisional alignment program, the cost associated with those will be booked on the restructuring line, and they will not be included as part of -- they are not part of our non-GAAP expense guidance that we released for 2023, yes.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And then with regard to the overall outlook for the business, I think that -- I would say it this way, I think, Brian, that in general, we feel really good about how we're delivering on the growth of our Solutions businesses across, as we mentioned, AFC as well as the investment analytics, so insights and workflows for the corporates and I know market tech business. And I think we continue to see really good client demand. There are some elongated sales cycles and that could bring the growth down a little bit for the year. But I think the one area that we do have some dependence on the market backdrop is in our listings business and our Index business. And there, we are hopeful that we'll see some improvement across index values, market values, which will then, of course, support bringing more companies to market, and that will help us manage through the year and be consistent with how we are looking at our targets. But those areas could create more of a challenge if we don't see an improvement in the overall market environment for this year. I think that's why we like to keep those targets as kind of medium to long term as we look at an average over multiple years just because of the fact that there are years where you have a tougher market backdrop. I would point out, though, that even with the tough market backdrop that we had in 2022, we were able to deliver 10% organic growth across our Solutions businesses. And we had 8% improvement -- increase in our ARR and 13% increase in our SaaS. So even with a really challenging market environment from last year, I think we were able to show a consistent story across Nasdaq.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Gautam Sawant from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGautam Sawant: Good morning, Adena and Ann. I wanted to just spend a second on Puro.earth and the long-term opportunity there. I know Puro.earth presented at COP 27 and the trading certificates increased 250% in 2022. Can you talk about the potential earnings contribution from this business in the future? And is there an opportunity to sell Puro.earth directly to your corporate clients that are across the U.S. and Nordic businesses?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Actually, we do. So what -- I love talking about Puro.earth. So just as a reminder, Puro.earth a carbon removal marketplace where we have a minority position in partnership with a company called Fortum in Finland. And we are really excited about the opportunity that Puro.earth provides to us and, frankly, to our clients. So we do already tap our corporate clients as clients. So they come in directly and buy carbon removal credits through the Puro.earth platform, and we leverage our corporate relationships to really continue to grow the demand for those credits. I think that what's holding that market back today, and it's very small, so I just want to enforce off on everyone that, that is a small business today. It did grow, as you said, actually, I think it was like 250% to 300% year-over-year but from a tiny base, it sits in our Market Platforms business. It supports our ESG strategy and that mega trend. But what's really holding that platform are all -- that whole marketplace back is supply. So we are really focused on high-quality industrial carbon removals. We do diligence on every supplier we put on the platform. We have -- we work with an advisory committee to determine which scientific methods we're willing even to put on the platform. We're very, very discerning in how we bring supply onto the platform. And given the fact that it's still a pretty nascent industry, we're really hamstrung by small supply today. So over the next three to five years, we actually expect a lot of investment to come into the carbon removal space. We think that will really bolster supply. We're replatforming Puro.earth to have a really advanced blockchain based registry that we can then leverage across multiple trading venues. And we're working with some market makers to help create -- they're going to buy up from removals and start to create a secondary market, so that we can also have trading activity start to develop on the platform. But I want to say this. I think Puro.earth is kind of like a 5 to 10-year strategy. It's a very small investment for us as of right now. It's a small but mighty team. But we are really, really excited about what it can become, but just recognize it's a long-term strategy.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I was hoping we could dig into some of the interplays in the kind of legacy listings business and the Corporate Solutions business. I guess, on the one hand, I was curious if you could help frame the revenues that could be at risk from stocks delisting over the course of this year, and then on the flip side, opportunities you guys might see from some of the discounts on the Corporate Solutions services that you provided to IPOs that listed over the last couple of years, those coming off and the probability of them starting to pay for service?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Yes. Thanks, Alex. I mean the SPAC revenue represents just over about 1% of total revenue for Nasdaq. So it's a small part of our revenue stream. We are seeing SPAC combined, but we're also seeing a number of SPAC decide to provide the money back to their shareholders. So it's a small part of our revenue. And -- but we're -- but we also recognize that the environment has changed a lot for SPACs, and so we would anticipate some reduction in revenue coming from the back of SPAC ultimately not finding combinations. So I think that's something that will probably have more of an effect in 2024 than in 2023, but it's something we're watching pretty closely. But as I said, just to size it, it's a little more than just 1% of the revenue. I think with regard to Corporate Services and Solutions, which is our IR and our ESG solutions to support corporates, you are right. We have a lot of clients who come on to our platform. We've been supporting them through the IPO package for the last two years. And so as we get particularly into 2024, we're going to see the opportunity for us to turn them in and convert them into paying clients. And so that is obviously -- that part of our outlook for that business is how we convert those clients to paying customers. We've also upsold those clients even during the IPO package period where we might sell them into some of our ESG packaged solutions and into a deeper set of IR solutions. So we do have them some of them as paying clients now. And I think that obviously, even bolsters our view that they'll continue to want to use our services beyond the IPO period. But I just want to say, I think that's more of a '24 opportunity than '23, but we're very optimistic about that. We have strong retention of clients as we convert them.\nOperator: And I show our last question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Good morning. Maybe a question on the BEC migration from your on-premise solution to your cloud-based platform. Could you just remind us of the revenue and margin impact for Nasdaq from this type of on-premise to cloud migration? I'm just trying to put some numbers around the impact so we have a better understanding of kind of the larger opportunity if we see more similar type announcements over the coming year or two?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I think that we'll probably need to come back to you to give you a little bit more of that view. I can't sit there and use one client and extrapolate it to the whole business. But when we do sign a client on to more of a SaaS-based market tech contract, there are two benefits. One is just it becomes an annualized recurring revenue as opposed to an implementation revenue, which has much lower margins, followed by a service and maintenance and license agreement which has a higher margin. So you have like more steady revenue and a more steady margin throughout the length of the contract. But I don't think we've given you a view yet into like what's the margin differential. And so I kind of feel like we probably need to come back and give a little bit more of an insight into that specifically as we gain more traction in getting our clients to sign on to cloud-based, particularly cloud-based solutions. So let's come back to you on that, but I just don't want to give you kind of a wrong answer right now.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you very much. Well, as we conclude today's call, I want to reiterate that our leadership team remains very focused on executing our strategy to deliver for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to continued discussions throughout the year on the progress we aim to make against our strategic priorities. So thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Neil, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on the following areas: Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial and business performance. The progress we have made to advance Nasdaq along our strategic journey, and our enterprise-wide ambitions and priorities for 2023 and beyond. I will also provide comments on the current market and regulatory environment before turning the call over to Ann for a deeper look at our financial results. We continue to deliver solid growth in 2022, even with an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and following a very strong 2021. 2022 was also a year of milestones, strategic firsts and market-leading innovation for Nasdaq. I'm proud of the Nasdaq team and the resiliency of our business as well as the trusted relationships we have with our clients. Before I turn to our financial performance, I want to remind everyone about our new corporate structure that we implemented during the fourth quarter. When we gathered at our Investor Day in November, we noted how the alignment of our business across three new divisions, Market Platforms, Capital Access Platforms and Anti-Financial Crime, allows us to capitalize on mega trends shaping the financial system to unlock new growth opportunities for our company. These trends include the modernization of markets where we continue to deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying infrastructure, the development of the ESG ecosystem where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless routes to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives, and the increasing need for advanced anti-financial crime technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI. Our financial results today reflect the new divisional alignment, and we look forward to continuing our journey as we deliver world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy with our long-term goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system. Now let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2022. First, regarding the fourth quarter, Nasdaq achieved $906 million in net revenues, a 2% increase compared to the prior year period and a 5% increase on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. In the quarter, we delivered 5% organic growth across our Solutions businesses even with an 11% drop in our Index revenues. We also delivered 4% organic growth in our Trading Services business in the fourth quarter on top of a very strong trading performance in the fourth quarter of 2021. For the full year of 2022, net revenues of $3.58 billion increased 5% from 2021 and 7% on an organic basis. Our Solutions businesses generated 10% annual organic revenue growth despite a fast-changing market environment, and our Trading Services revenues increased 1% on the back of very strong performance in 2021. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Annualized SaaS revenues increased 13% to $725 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, representing 36% of total company ARR. For the full year, non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.66 increased 6% from 2021. Our strong performance in 2022 against a challenging macroeconomic backdrop illustrates the strength of our diversified business and our ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives. Next, I'm going to turn to specific divisional highlights, which reflect the new corporate structure, focusing mainly on the fourth quarter results. In our Capital Access Platforms business -- division, we delivered $420 million in total revenue in the fourth quarter, a 2% increase in organic growth. Revenue in our Data and Listing Services business increased by 3% from the prior year period and 6% organic growth. primarily due to an increase in annual listing fees and growth in proprietary data revenues driven by higher international demand, partially offset by a decrease in initial listing fee revenues. In 2022, Nasdaq maintained its position as the leading U.S. exchange for IPOs for the 10th consecutive year with 87 operating company listings for a 92% annual win rate. In Europe, our Baltic, Nordic and First North exchanges combined welcomed 63 new listings in 2022, including 38 IPOs. For the second consecutive year, Nasdaq Stockholm remains the most successful listing venue in Europe. In our Index business, we saw revenue decrease by 11% versus the prior year period, primarily due to lower average AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indices, partially offset by higher revenues related to futures trading linked to the NASDAQ 100 Index. Year-over-year average AUM for the fourth quarter declined by 19%. The fourth quarter presented a particularly challenging market backdrop on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Ann will provide more details on the AUM and trading dynamics that drove the fourth quarter revenue decline. Focusing on the full year performance, our Index revenues for the full year of 2022 increased 6% versus 2021 due to higher net inflows and futures volumes. Net inflows into exchange-traded products totaled $34 billion in 2022, and we saw demand grow for our new offerings with 44 ETPs tracking Nasdaq indexes, accumulating $3.5 billion in AUM during the year. In our Workflow and Insights business, which include our Corporate Solutions as well as our Investment Analytics business, our fourth quarter revenues increased 8% from the prior year period or 10% organically, reflecting deepened client engagement and strong client retention. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $403 million in total revenues in the fourth quarter, a 3% increase from the prior year period or 5% organic growth. Our Trading Services business, which includes our transactional and U.S. Tape Plan data businesses, delivered combined total revenue of $253 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of 4% organically from the prior year period. This is primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives trading revenues, reflecting higher revenue capture versus the prior year period and higher industry volumes. Cash equities trading revenues were lower year-over-year, primarily driven by lower European cash equities revenue, partially offset by modest growth in the U.S. cash equities business. During the fourth quarter, we were incredibly pleased to announce the migration of Nasdaq MRX, 1 of our 6 U.S. options exchanges, to the cloud in partnership with Amazon Web Services. The new cloud-enabled system delivers -- continues to deliver ultra-resiliency to our market participants while improving latency performance by 10%. As the first exchange to put a major market in the cloud, this marks a significant milestone in our journey to build the next-generation technology infrastructure for the world's capital markets. This success has also reinforced our credibility with our technology clients. As illustrated by Bolsa Electronica de Chile's agreement earlier this month to migrate their current on-premise Nasdaq trading technology to our cloud-based marketplace services platform. We are thrilled that BEC has chosen us to help manage this next phase of their cloud journey. And lastly, in our Marketplace Technology business, we delivered $150 million in revenues during the fourth quarter, of 5% increase versus the prior year period. Growth in revenue was primarily due to increased demand for connectivity, driving a record year for our Trade Management Services business as well as higher SaaS-based market technology revenues. Order intake in our Market Technology business totaled $106 million for the quarter and $264 million for the full year, which compares to a record of $304 million in 2021. We had strong order intake across both existing and new clients with over 90% of our new clients signing up for SaaS solutions, an encouraging indicator of growth returning to the technology business post pandemic. We signed 12 new technology clients and completed five implementations in our Market Technology business in 2022. We continue to make good progress with our post-trade implementations, taking two of our largest clients into live operation during the year. Over the past 18 months, we've seen increased demand for our technology solutions with many current and new client conversations focused on market modernization initiatives encompassing both cloud delivery and SaaS. Before I conclude my remarks regarding our Market Platforms division, I want to offer brief comments here on the SEC's equity market structure proposals, which the commission published in December of 2022. We're encouraged that the proposals addressed many of our recommendations from a paper that we published last year on optimizing markets. While we believe that the equity markets work well now, we acknowledge that there are always opportunities for improvements. Accordingly, we support the SEC's efforts to modernize and enhance equity market structure to improve trading efficiency, bolster competition, increase market transparency, strengthen best obligations and ultimately, achieve better outcomes for investors. In proposing to introduce significant changes to markets that are already highly complex and interconnected, we think it is critical for the commission to strive to avoid unintended consequences by proceeding incrementally, methodically and collaboratively. There are also a few areas where we differ with the SEC's approach, and we plan to recommend improvements, modifications and or alternatives during the comment period. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $82 million in total revenue during the fourth quarter, a 21% organic increase from the prior year period and 14% when adjusting for the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The revenue increase was driven by strong demand for our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions or what we call our FRAML solutions in addition to modest growth in our surveillance solutions. Regarding our FRAML solutions specifically, revenue grew 23% when adjusting for the impact of deferred revenue in the prior year period. The business saw continued growth in new clients across small to medium banks with 98 new SMB clients signed during the quarter. In addition, the business signed its first two clients to its crypto anti-financial crime platform in 2022. This is an exciting offering that allows crypto companies to identify crime, ensure regulatory compliance and prevent losses. We also continue to see momentum following several proofs of concepts with a number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, including signing a Tier 2 bank for our enterprise fraud solution during the fourth quarter. Feedback on the proof-of-concept results has been very positive, and we anticipate signing additional clients in 2023. I want to take a moment here to acknowledge our leadership appointment that took place this month in our Anti-Financial Crime division. Brendan Brothers, a co-founder of Verafin and the division's Head of Strategy, has been appointed interim Head of our AFC division. He succeeds Jamie King, who's retiring from Nasdaq. We're grateful for Jamie's tremendous contributions to Verafin, and we wish him very well in his next chapter. And we're excited to have Brendan step in to his role as we continue to execute against our AFC road map. As I mentioned at the start of my remarks today, Nasdaq has made notable progress against our broader strategic journey. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2023 and beyond. First, we will strive to realize the benefits of our new divisional alignment. We aim to unlock the growth opportunities that our new structure provides us. We intend to deliver an enhanced client experience by delivering more unified solutions through a One Nasdaq approach to our clients. We will have a focused capital allocation strategy across our three divisions, and we will increase our go-to-market agility by integrating related software development and marketing talent into each division, which would facilitate streamlined decision-making. Second, we want to remain positioned for success amid a dynamic market environment. With macroeconomic uncertainty likely to persist as we continue into 2023, we want to demonstrate the value of our mission-critical solutions in an environment where businesses know that they need to keep investing but are increasingly focused on quick time to value and strong return on invested capital. And third, we want to continue advancing our long-term cloud and AI strategy across the Nasdaq franchise by optimizing our agile development and leveraging machine intelligence across our solutions to unlock more opportunities to deliver innovation to our clients. Within market platforms, as we deploy our new data-centric system architecture, combined with the scalability and the analytics engines that are offered through the cloud infrastructure, we believe we'll be able to develop new AI-based order types and we'll offer more advanced capabilities to our market participants connected into our ecosystem. These capabilities will also become available to our exchange technology clients as we work collaboratively with them to deploy cloud-based market infrastructures in their home markets. Beyond market platforms, we're already well positioned with our cloud-based SaaS solutions across many of our solutions businesses, and we're on our journey to bring more of our solutions into the cloud. In 2023, we're currently migrating our clients onto our next-gen cloud-based governance platform and trade surveillance platform. As our anti-financial crime solutions demonstrate, having a cloud-based data lake unlocks enormous potential in applying advanced AI algorithms and self-reinforcement learning engines to our solutions. And with new step function improvements in AI that are coming to market, we're extremely excited to apply those technologies to more of our solutions in 2023 and beyond. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities in the quarters to come. Before I wrap up, I would like to address the current market environment. Uncertainty still lingers across the global economy and market-driven headwinds. And if they persist throughout the year, that could impact our near-term growth outlook across listings and index in 2023. We are also seeing a modest elongation of sales cycles for certain of our solutions, notably our IR solutions and our asset owner solutions, which is part of our Analytics business. We are viewed by our IR and asset owner clients as a trusted partner to help them manage through the challenges that the markets have presented. But we are finding, particularly in more hard-hit sectors, that clients are going through more internal gates to approve investments in IR and portfolio management solutions. More generally, across our broader Nasdaq platform, client demand remains strong. Despite the macro uncertainty, we believe 2023 will be marked by how well businesses continue to adapt to the digital transformation of the economy through investments in technology. Nasdaq benefits from that digital transformation given our range of technology and analytics solutions. Building on our foundation of solid client retention, competitive success and deepened engagement with clients, we have confidence that our clients' investments in technology and cloud-based SaaS solutions will continue to be a priority. Therefore, we maintain our conviction in the investments we're making to deliver modern world-class solutions to our clients. We have a very resilient and diversified value proposition and are well prepared to guide our clients and our companies through this dynamic environment. We are entering the year with a continued focus on achieving our revenue growth outlook over the medium term as we navigate a complex 2023, and we remain confident that our longer-term investments across market modernization, ESG solutions and anti-financial crime technology will create value for our clients and shareholders alike. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our fourth quarter produced solid results for Nasdaq, completing a very successful 2022 for our company. Looking ahead in 2023, we enter the year focused on realizing the benefits of our new corporate structure to amplify growth across our key pillars of liquidity, transparency and integrity as we look to advance towards our goal of becoming the trusted fabric of the global financial system. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details. Sure. Okay. So that was a good long and multi-pronged question, Rich. That's okay. No, no, that was good. Okay. So in terms of outlook for 2023, I think the general view inside of Nasdaq right now is that we continue to have really strong client interactions across all the businesses that comprise our annualized recurring revenue. So that's our Anti-Financial Crime business, our -- what we call our Corporate Solutions business, our investment analytics capabilities and particularly in our analytics and our data businesses and in our Marketplace Technology business. We still see really good client demand, client interactions, progress against our strategy. I feel our ESG services had double-digit growth and we continue to see really great capabilities and opportunities there. Our anti-financial crime technology continues to show really strong growth. And I think that the market modernization efforts are really impact -- having a positive effect on our engagement with our market tech clients as they're thinking about modernizing their infrastructure. So what I would say, the long-term trends that we're really driving towards feel good as we go into 2023, and we feel really great about the client engagement. The market backdrop, obviously, we're not immune to it. No company is. But I would agree that exchanges have a really resilient -- we're a resilient platform because we have this underpinning of trading, we have this underpinning of our listings and listing fees. We have an underpinning of data that really help keep us really strong and quite resilient in -- across all different market environments. But there are a couple of areas where we have market beta. So certainly, listings revenues won't grow as fast if we don't have listings come out to the market. We have 200 companies on file looking to tap the NASDAQ and hopefully, if the markets open up as we go through the year. But as you know, it takes 2 to tango. So we've got the supply the demand really comes for investors feeling confident underwriting new deals. And I think if we can see interest rates kind of top out and we kind of know where that ends up, we see inflation continue to come down and we have a more certain economic underfooting, we could actually see activity pick up, particularly in the latter half of the year. And we're hopeful for that. And that will help, obviously, with '23 growth but also help with '24. I think with the Index business, it's obviously subject to market beta with our AUM. And we were able to withstand a lot of changes in market values last year. But the fourth quarter, you could see, had a big impact. So the AUM dropped a lot. We didn't have as robust inflows in the fourth quarter to counteract that. But as we go into 2023, we're leased off to a better start. We'll have to see how that evolves, and that's an area where we will have market data through the year. So we'll have to see that goes. But if I were to sum it up, though, the areas where we have recurring revenues and we have our SaaS revenues, we feel really good about how we're engaging with clients. We do have some elongated sales cycles across IR and analytics. But generally speaking, really strong demand. The trends that we're underwriting, we feel really good about and investments we're making there. And I think the markets will be the markets, but I think we've been able to demonstrate really strong performance across different market cycles. Lastly, you asked a question about Reg NMS and the fees and volumes. It's really early, Rich. It's an initial proposal from the SEC. There'll be rounds of comments, there'll be probably revisions in the proposals. And so it will be several years before we kind of see the impact of that. But you're doing the same tactics that we're trying to do, which is we see more opportunity to bring more retail volume onto lit venues, and that's obviously going to benefit us. But we also see a change in the tick sizes and the relevant access fees, and that's where we have to kind of look at that, the kind of what I'll call the different dynamics that that will result in. And so we actually kind of net-net are generally positive on what the SEC's proposed. But we obviously want to make sure we're calibrating the tick sizes and the access fees appropriately for what they're trying to achieve there. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Michael. So generally, if we look at all of AFC, so you've got anti-financial crime, so you've got the FRAML business which is kind of the Verafin capabilities, and then you have our trade surveillance, which is really the surveillance technology we offer to trading firms and we have market surveillance, which is the technology -- the surveillance technology we offer to markets. In Verafin, as I mentioned, we continue to see really nice strong demand there, and client -- especially with small and medium banks, the conversion has been quite consistent, finding a lead to getting them to become paying clients. And we had, I think it was 98 new clients in the quarter. And we had really strong dynamics there. And it's -- I have to say, I think what we offer is a great product and it shows up in the sales. As we go upmarket, that's where we're kind of -- we, as Verafin, are facing some new unchartered waters, right? We're getting up to the top of the top of the banking universe. And I think that what we're seeing is Tier 2 banks, we're getting them signed up and lined up slowly but surely. The proof of concepts are showing a significant reduction in false positives and a better ability to identify real fraud. And so I think that's really -- the proof points are really helpful in getting to convert a client. Tier 2 banks, you're talking more like a, I would say, anywhere from a 6 to 12-month sales cycle there. And then you get up to the large Tier 1 banks. And that's where, again, we have several proofs of concepts that are completed now, and I think that we're showing really strong results in terms of improvements in lower false positives, better fraud detected. But the contracting cycles there are really long because they go through a really deep review internally. We go through, obviously, cyber review. We go through a lot of different things. And those sales cycles can be anywhere from, I would say, kind of 9 to 15 to 18 months. So we are really hopeful because we completed some of those proof of concepts in the first half of last year that we should be able to convert them this year. And I can only say, Michael, we're not giving specific numbers, but it's a good number of proof of concepts that we've completed. It gives us an opportunity to show that we can get into the Tier 1 banks as we go through '23. And so we're confident we'll be able to show those proof points as we go through the year. Yes. So Alex, thanks for the question and it's not snippy. So -- but I would say this. We actually made that change, so what happened was we used to have the options tape revenue sitting inside the Market Services business, and we have the equities tape revenue sitting inside of Market Data. And -- but what we did with the realignment was we actually moved the management of the equities tape into the Markets team because of the fact that the revenues associated with the equity tape are more -- they ebb and flow with market share and other dynamics in the market as opposed to just pure client demand. And so we decided, and so when we first redid -- went into the new divisional alignment, we actually moved the options tape into data as opposed to moving the equity tape into the markets. And we -- as we went through the fourth quarter and we really thought about kind of aligning the business with the management, we actually decided to make a switch. So we kind of moved the options and equities tapes now into market platforms because that's where the team that supports them are moving into the Market Platforms division, are being managed by the Market Platforms team. So we did not do it intentionally to kind of recast targets or anything like that. We're not changing our medium to long-term outlook across our Solutions businesses. 7% to 10% is the target and the outlook that we expect to be able to achieve over medium to long term. But we did want to move those products just into the group that's managing them. That's really the only catalyst. Yes. And I think, Owen, one thing we did point out because embedded in that 5% annual growth in expenses is about, 1 percentage point of that is really the continued investment we're making in our digital assets business. As we kind of get closer to launching that business, hopefully in the first half of this year. So that's one concentrated investment that we've called out as we went through and discussed the outlook. I think beyond that, when we look at the remaining 4% growth, as Ann said, the majority of that growth really just comes from making sure we're making the right investments across the three key pillars. We're not kind of quantifying investments in each one of those pillars. But they're all -- you have to think about it this way. The growth outlook of one of those businesses, if there's a higher growth outlook, it's likely that we're putting more investment dollars or at least on a percentage basis, putting more investment into those businesses. So like our AFC business. If we have a medium to long-term growth outlook of 18% to 23%, we're investing in the R&D and the go-to-market and the sales capabilities to make sure we support that growth. And so that would have a higher level of investment than something that's growing 5%, let's say. But I also think that -- as a general matter, we feel like we're making the right choices of where to invest our capital to make sure we can sustain our growth and make sure we achieve this on the medium to long-term outlook. Sure. Well, I think that as we look at our kind of our medium- to long-term outlook, that 18% to 23%, we feel is well supported by the sales opportunities, the pipeline and the overall continued investment in the actual products so that we can continue to expand our capabilities. I thought I'd give you just a little bit more detail on how we look at the dynamics. And I mentioned -- as I mentioned before, we have our FRAML solutions. And that obviously, that's our Verafin asset, and that was delivering more than 20% growth in the quarter and continues to have really strong growth potential even as it continues to scale. And so I think there, Dan, we definitely think that the Tier 1, Tier 2 -- we're not dependent on Tier 2 and Tier 1 banks to support that growth rate in the short term. But as we continue -- as we move upmarket and we are able to attract this Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, the ticket sizes are much, much higher. So over the longer term, showing momentum across that will be important to continue to maintain the strong growth trends that we're showing in that business. The other two parts of the business, trade surveillance, that continues to have kind of high single-digit, low double-digit growth, and it has for a long time. That's providing surveillance solutions to trading firms. And there, we're continuing to drive that growth by expanding the types of modules that we offer, like our crypto modules as well as more -- bringing more asset classes onto the platform and really continue to globalize the clientele there. We have gotten to the point where we become an enterprise provider of surveillance across large banks, and that continues to be a good growth opportunity to support that kind of high single digit, low double digits. The one area that is actually has a low -- I would say flat to low growth profile is our market surveillance business where it's the smallest part of the division. But it's a harder one to grow a lot because the overall base of client opportunities is smaller. That's where we provide surveillance to markets and regulators. And there, that business was largely flat for the year and continues to have a low growth profile. So that's -- I think certainly in 2022, that has created a little bit of kind of a lower growth view. And as we go into '23 and '25 or '23 to '24, '25, '26, we hope to find new ways to catalyze some growth there, but we will expect that to be a low grower in the years to come. So hopefully, that just gives you a little more context. Yes. And then with regard to the overall outlook for the business, I think that -- I would say it this way, I think, Brian, that in general, we feel really good about how we're delivering on the growth of our Solutions businesses across, as we mentioned, AFC as well as the investment analytics, so insights and workflows for the corporates and I know market tech business. And I think we continue to see really good client demand. There are some elongated sales cycles and that could bring the growth down a little bit for the year. But I think the one area that we do have some dependence on the market backdrop is in our listings business and our Index business. And there, we are hopeful that we'll see some improvement across index values, market values, which will then, of course, support bringing more companies to market, and that will help us manage through the year and be consistent with how we are looking at our targets. But those areas could create more of a challenge if we don't see an improvement in the overall market environment for this year. I think that's why we like to keep those targets as kind of medium to long term as we look at an average over multiple years just because of the fact that there are years where you have a tougher market backdrop. I would point out, though, that even with the tough market backdrop that we had in 2022, we were able to deliver 10% organic growth across our Solutions businesses. And we had 8% improvement -- increase in our ARR and 13% increase in our SaaS. So even with a really challenging market environment from last year, I think we were able to show a consistent story across Nasdaq. Sure. Yes. Actually, we do. So what -- I love talking about Puro.earth. So just as a reminder, Puro.earth a carbon removal marketplace where we have a minority position in partnership with a company called Fortum in Finland. And we are really excited about the opportunity that Puro.earth provides to us and, frankly, to our clients. So we do already tap our corporate clients as clients. So they come in directly and buy carbon removal credits through the Puro.earth platform, and we leverage our corporate relationships to really continue to grow the demand for those credits. I think that what's holding that market back today, and it's very small, so I just want to enforce off on everyone that, that is a small business today. It did grow, as you said, actually, I think it was like 250% to 300% year-over-year but from a tiny base, it sits in our Market Platforms business. It supports our ESG strategy and that mega trend. But what's really holding that platform are all -- that whole marketplace back is supply. So we are really focused on high-quality industrial carbon removals. We do diligence on every supplier we put on the platform. We have -- we work with an advisory committee to determine which scientific methods we're willing even to put on the platform. We're very, very discerning in how we bring supply onto the platform. And given the fact that it's still a pretty nascent industry, we're really hamstrung by small supply today. So over the next three to five years, we actually expect a lot of investment to come into the carbon removal space. We think that will really bolster supply. We're replatforming Puro.earth to have a really advanced blockchain based registry that we can then leverage across multiple trading venues. And we're working with some market makers to help create -- they're going to buy up from removals and start to create a secondary market, so that we can also have trading activity start to develop on the platform. But I want to say this. I think Puro.earth is kind of like a 5 to 10-year strategy. It's a very small investment for us as of right now. It's a small but mighty team. But we are really, really excited about what it can become, but just recognize it's a long-term strategy. Great. Yes. Thanks, Alex. I mean the SPAC revenue represents just over about 1% of total revenue for Nasdaq. So it's a small part of our revenue stream. We are seeing SPAC combined, but we're also seeing a number of SPAC decide to provide the money back to their shareholders. So it's a small part of our revenue. And -- but we're -- but we also recognize that the environment has changed a lot for SPACs, and so we would anticipate some reduction in revenue coming from the back of SPAC ultimately not finding combinations. So I think that's something that will probably have more of an effect in 2024 than in 2023, but it's something we're watching pretty closely. But as I said, just to size it, it's a little more than just 1% of the revenue. I think with regard to Corporate Services and Solutions, which is our IR and our ESG solutions to support corporates, you are right. We have a lot of clients who come on to our platform. We've been supporting them through the IPO package for the last two years. And so as we get particularly into 2024, we're going to see the opportunity for us to turn them in and convert them into paying clients. And so that is obviously -- that part of our outlook for that business is how we convert those clients to paying customers. We've also upsold those clients even during the IPO package period where we might sell them into some of our ESG packaged solutions and into a deeper set of IR solutions. So we do have them some of them as paying clients now. And I think that obviously, even bolsters our view that they'll continue to want to use our services beyond the IPO period. But I just want to say, I think that's more of a '24 opportunity than '23, but we're very optimistic about that. We have strong retention of clients as we convert them. Yes. I think that we'll probably need to come back to you to give you a little bit more of that view. I can't sit there and use one client and extrapolate it to the whole business. But when we do sign a client on to more of a SaaS-based market tech contract, there are two benefits. One is just it becomes an annualized recurring revenue as opposed to an implementation revenue, which has much lower margins, followed by a service and maintenance and license agreement which has a higher margin. So you have like more steady revenue and a more steady margin throughout the length of the contract. But I don't think we've given you a view yet into like what's the margin differential. And so I kind of feel like we probably need to come back and give a little bit more of an insight into that specifically as we gain more traction in getting our clients to sign on to cloud-based, particularly cloud-based solutions. So let's come back to you on that, but I just don't want to give you kind of a wrong answer right now. Great. Thank you very much. Well, as we conclude today's call, I want to reiterate that our leadership team remains very focused on executing our strategy to deliver for all of our stakeholders, and we look forward to continued discussions throughout the year on the progress we aim to make against our strategic priorities. So thank you very much, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in the file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. As a reminder, on Slide 4, our financial reporting reflects the new corporate structure that we announced last quarter. Additionally, in order to better align our financial reporting with our internal management structure, we also recast the U.S. cash equity and options tape plan revenues into the Trading Services business within Market Platforms division from the Data and Listing Services business within the Capital Access Platforms division. Investors can review an updated supplement on the IR website with historical time periods reflecting this change. I will start by reviewing fourth quarter 2022 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $906 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 4% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income decreased 1% while the non-GAAP operating margin of 49% was down from 51% in the prior year period. For the full year 2022, the non-GAAP operating margin totaled 52%, a decrease of 1 percentage point from 2021. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $317 million or $0.64 per diluted share compared to $328 million or $0.64 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $725 million, an increase of 13%. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15, starting with the Market Platforms division. Revenues increased $10 million or 3%. The organic increase was 5%, and there was a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services' organic growth totaled 4% with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. equity derivatives and U.S. cash equity revenues due to higher capture and higher industry volumes, partially offset by lower European cash equity revenues due to lower industry volumes. Within marketplace technology, we had strong performance in our Trade Management Services business and delivered another quarter of organic growth in the Market Technology business, driven by higher SaaS revenues and strong order intake during the period. This builds on the positive organic revenue growth in the third quarter of 2022 and, is a further encouraging proof point that the programs and initiatives implemented by the leadership team are moving the business forward. ARR totaled $503 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 52% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 54% in the full year of 2022 both decreased 2 percentage points from the prior year period. The change primarily reflects increased expenses associated with the continued investment in our people and our businesses, including our digital asset strategy. Capital Access Platform revenues were unchanged, reflecting organic revenue growth of $7 million or 2% as well as a 2% negative impact of changes in FX rates. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the Workflow and Insights and Data and Listing Services businesses, partially offset by an organic decline in Index revenues. Spending a moment on Index. Overall Index revenue declined by 11% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. When examining the key drivers of the financial performance, our asset-based licensing revenues declined 21% compared to the prior year period, partially offset by a 25% increase in futures-related revenues linked to the NASDAQ 100 Index. Average AUM during the period, which is used to calculate our asset-based revenues each quarter, decreased 19% from the prior year period and trading volumes in futures linked to the NASDAQ 100 index increased 21% from the prior year quarter. To assist analysts and investors going forward, we are updating our public disclosures to provide average AUM each quarter in addition to the end of the period, which will be -- which will better align our key disclosures with our key revenue drivers for the business. One additional note looking forward to the first quarter of 2023. Trading activity of instruments linked to our indexes achieved certain annual thresholds during the second quarter of '22 that resulted in an increase in licensing economics during the remainder of the year. As we begin 2023, the economics of certain agreements reset for the new year. We estimate that this will lead to approximately $9 million of lower revenue in the first quarter of 2023 compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, assuming similar trading activity and product mix in the two periods. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 50% in the fourth quarter decreased -- the fourth quarter of 2022 decreased 3 percentage points from the prior year period. The operating margin for the full year 2022 was 54.4%, up 60 basis points from 53.8% in 2021. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 21%, with $4 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in 4Q '21. Organic growth was 21% in the period or 14% when excluding the impact of deferred revenue, reflecting healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to 4Q '21, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $312 million, an increase of 16% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced, totaled $338 million, an increase of 17% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 32% in the fourth quarter of '22 and 26% in the full year of '22. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $26 million to $460 million. The increase reflects a $45 million organic increase, partially offset by a $20 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of an acquisition and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and general and administrative expense. The higher compensation reflects our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 10% increase in the team over the past 12 months; and annual merit increases, which were higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation. The higher general and administrative expense primarily reflects higher travel versus the prior year period as we returned to a more normalized level of travel in 2022. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a divisional alignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of our new corporate structure. As a reminder, we did this to focus our business more sharply on three megatrends: modernizing markets, ESG and anti-financial crime. The structure change not only increases our focus but will also bring commercial teams closer together, put technology and marketing resources closer to our products and redefine how we engage, attract and retain clients across products. As a result, we expect to incur $115 million to $145 million in pretax charges, approximately 40% of which will be non-cash charges. The program will be open for two years and has three main components: one, asset impairments and contract terminations; two, employee-related costs to support the divisional realignment; and three, onetime consulting and other spend designed to help us unlock revenue synergies. We are targeting benefits in the form of combined annual run rate operating efficiencies and revenue synergies of at least $30 million by 2025. Costs related to the divisional alignment program will be recorded as restructuring expense. We are initiating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.77 billion to $1.85 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range reflects an increase of just over 5%, including an increase of 1% related to our digital asset strategy and primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, anti-financial crime and market modernization. We expect the 2023 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 17. Debt increased by $27 million versus 3Q '22, primarily due to net issuances of $465 million of commercial paper and $164 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro, partially offset by repayment of $600 million of 0.445% senior unsecured notes at maturity. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio remains at 2.7 times as compared to the third quarter of 2022. With record free cash flow, excluding Section 31 fees of $1.5 billion in 2022, our weighted average cash cost of debt of 2.2% and no long-term debt maturities until 2026, we have positioned the company to minimize the impact of rising rates and to provide flexibility to support our growth strategy. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. As of December 31, 2022, there was an aggregate $650 million remaining under the Board-authorized share repurchase program, reflecting an increase in authorization approved by the Board in December. Turning to Page 18 of the presentation. I would like to highlight some of the significant progress we have made, executing on our sustainable strategy. For the seventh consecutive year, we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index, one of the most prestigious environmental, social and governance ranking benchmarks. Nasdaq was 1 of 8 diversified financial services companies selected for inclusion in the 2022 index. In addition, we were only -- 1 of only 283 companies out of 15,000 evaluated and named to CDP's 2022 Climate Change A list. In closing today, Nasdaq's fourth quarter of 2022 results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure. I'll start. Hi Owen. So when we think about -- I guess, just coming back to the guidance, we've got that midpoint of our guidance is at 5%, which is when you look at our 4% to 7% medium-term outlook, we're just below the midpoint of that which would be 5.5%. When we think about what comprises that 5%, substantially all of our growth is to support, like you said, the -- our growth initiatives across ESG, AFC and market modernization. And I would characterize them as the investment we need to continue building out the long-term opportunities for those business to support the revenue growth we have in our outlook over the medium term. And so I think it's really about that 18% to 23% medium-term outlook on AFC and then our capital access platform medium-term outlook to support the growth there, ESG being the biggest or a high -- growing off a small base but a high-growing portion of the Workflow and Insights portion of the business. Okay. Thanks, Craig. I can get started on that question. So if we think about just overall the realignment program that we've launched, the objective of the program is really tied very, very closely to our restructure of the -- and realignment of the divisions themselves. So when you think about the employee costs that are embedded in that range of $115 million to $145 million, they're really complementing our divisional realignment and not broad-based. We're not looking at anything sort of from a broad-based company perspective, but really the effect of looking at location and functional strategy within the alignment of the divisions. And then also migrating some of our tech to optimize the power of the combined divisions. And we think about those costs coming in over the next two years and with an expected return on those costs of an annualized run rate savings and revenue synergies of about $30 million a year sort of fully baked in by 2025. And I'd say that $30 million estimate, right now, the majority of that is on the expense side. Sure, Brian. So on the first part of your question, the divisional alignment program, the cost associated with those will be booked on the restructuring line, and they will not be included as part of -- they are not part of our non-GAAP expense guidance that we released for 2023, yes."

I know many of you on the line today are planning to participate. If you have not registered, please do so at ir.nasdaq.com. I'll now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a summary of the new corporate structure for Nasdaq that we announced during the quarter. The new structure organizes our business units into the following three divisions that align us more closely to the foundational shifts that are driving our strategic evolution. Market Platforms led by Tal Cohen will include our North American and European market services as well as our market infrastructure technology business. The division will also include our digital assets and carbon markets businesses. Capital Access platforms led by Nelson Griggs will combine our corporate platforms and investment intelligence businesses. And Anti-Financial Crime led by Jamie King, will include Verafin, our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solution, as well as our market and trade surveillance business. Our new structure will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. As Ann will note later, we have provided supplemental information to help investors and analysts prepare for the financial and reporting implications of our new structure. This information is available on our IR website and was furnished in our Form 8-K filed this morning. Additionally, we will discuss our businesses through the lens of this new structure at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8. We believe the new structure will elevate our strategy and amplify our growth opportunities by allowing us to provide even more holistic solutions to our clients' most complex challenges. We view this as the next chapter in the strategic pivot that we launched five years ago, which solidified our focus on liquidity, transparency and integrity as the foundation of our strategic growth pillars. While these strategic themes are carried across our divisions, each division has a central theme that will help define its strategic focus. Market platforms will focus on maximizing the liquidity of the capital markets through our role as a market operator and as a provider of market ecosystems to our technology clients. This division will center around the modernization of markets, including the migration of markets and core infrastructure to the cloud and the emergence of blockchain and the resulting digital assets as elements of future market infrastructure. Nasdaq today serves as a powerful capital markets platform. We are a leading force in the modernization of marketplaces through our world-class technology, including the progress we're making as we migrate our own markets to our next-gen exchange platform in an edge cloud environment. We are also actively deploying our next-gen market platform to our market technology clients. And through our new structure, we see an opportunity for us to drive a broader strategy as one integrated unit. For instance, as we move forward with our digital assets platform, we see our role as being broader than a market operator or a market technology provider. It is a true platform opportunity, creating a custody foundation with strong anti-financial crime capabilities that allows multiple market venues, including those to whom we sell our market technology to connect and where we can facilitate institutional liquidity across venues more seamlessly than exist today. It's just one example of how the divisional structure will have more power, working together both as an operator and as a technology partner. We are excited to demonstrate how we can combine our expertise in managing market infrastructure coupled with our focus on leading technologies to support exchanges and market participants in new ways to drive the global flow of capital. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we will leverage the insights and capabilities across our corporate platforms and investment intelligence team. And we will be focused on the transparency pillar, reflecting the profound shift in behavior among corporates and investors with a focus on long-term value creation. We are seeing a sustained prioritization across the buy-side on long-term value creation and the subsequent response across corporates to engage their investor base in this evolving construct. For instance, there is a notable opportunity for Nasdaq to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate issuers by providing advisory services along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community. As we mature our strategy, we have an opportunity to bridge these capabilities into the investment community through analytics, indexes and data solutions. More generally, capital access platforms will be positioned to connect the investor and the issuer communities through actionable insights, industry-leading indexes and modernized workflows. This will allow us to provide more seamless, more holistic and more impactful solutions that help both stakeholder groups navigate the increasing complexity of the evolving financial system. And finally, our Anti-Financial Crime division will continue to focus on strengthening and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system. Anti-financial crime technology represents an already large and fast-growing sector with structural and regulatory tailwinds. And as the financial system transforms and becomes more technologically driven and sophisticated, the threats to its integrity are growing in scale and sophistication as well. Financial institutions face increasing -- I'm sorry, face significant challenges in detecting and preventing financial crime, and therefore, are investing significant capital and resources and combating those threats. Nasdaq's Anti-Financial Crime division focuses on delivering a world-class platform with holistic solutions and capabilities to support financial institutions and fighting financial crime more effectively across their networks and the wider financial system. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us to further lean into the areas that are prime for growth as we become the trusted fabric of the financial system. As I noted earlier, we will have an opportunity to provide more details and answer your questions about this new structure for Nasdaq at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8. Now let's turn to our results. Nasdaq delivered strong third quarter results with $890 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and a 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of the changes in FX rates in acquisitions and divestitures. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 8% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $699 million in the third quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 13%. We are pleased with the continued consistent growth across our recurring revenue segments, complemented by positive organic contributions from other areas, including index licensing and trading. Turning next to the specific business highlights starting with our Solutions segment. Our Solutions segment delivered total revenue of $584 million during the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven from activity across the full breadth of our businesses, including our index and investment analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings and market infrastructure technology business as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total revenue in the third quarter, a 4% increase overall from the prior year period. Our organic growth was 6%, excluding the effect of FX, with contributions to organic growth from each of the three businesses during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business increased by 2% from the prior year period and 5% organically, excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients. Our index business saw revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $56 billion over the last 12 months. We also saw continued strong results from licensed futures activities, which, together with the impact of positive inflows more than offset the negative impact of market beta. In our Analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX. Our combined investment in Solovis offerings saw strong revenue growth driven by the sequential impact of new sales and client retention. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for that team, which underscores the power of these offerings across both asset owners and asset managers. Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $132 million in total revenues in the third quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year period. This was driven by growth in both the anti-financial crime and the market infrastructure technology businesses. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a very encouraging third quarter with a 24% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by new sales across both our fraud and anti-money laundering and surveillance solutions as well as the $7 million impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the prior year period. Regarding Verafin specifically, we grew revenues 25%, excluding the $7 million impact of the deferred revenue write-down on the prior year period. We are particularly proud of the team's continued ability to sign new clients across small to medium banks, which is the core of the current franchise with 54 new small, medium banks clients signed during the quarter. We are also pleased by the results of recent proof of concepts with several Tier 1 banks. As an example, in one POC that we ran, we were able to reduce false positives by 25% by simultaneously identifying 3.5x more dollars in fraudulent payments. Moving next to our market infrastructure technology business. We generated $55 million in revenues, representing 8% organic growth. We are pleased to see the business return to positive organic growth versus the prior year period for the first time in over a year. We continue to be on track with large complex deliveries, and we have a strong pipeline of engaged clients and prospects. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $305 million during the third quarter, a 4% increase versus the prior year period or 8% higher organically, excluding the impact of FX. The increased revenue year-over-year was broad-based, with especially strong growth in trade management services, which had a record quarter and increases across each of our trading businesses, equity derivatives, cash equities and FICC. Lastly, we were excited to announce during the quarter the launch of our new digital assets business to power the digital asset ecosystem. This new business underscores our ambition to facilitate broader institutional participation in digital assets by providing trusted and institutional-grade solutions, focused on custody, liquidity and integrity. As part of our Market Services segment, Nasdaq Digital assets will initially develop and advanced custody solution, coupled with liquidity and execution capabilities geared to serving institutional clients by enabling safe transaction and storage of digital assets. This solution is developed through an innovation and innovative technology approach that brings together the best attributes of hot and cold crypto wallets, providing a high degree of accessibility without compromising security. Additionally, we will incorporate our anti-financial crime technology with new coverage for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including a comprehensive suite of crypto-specific detection and investigation capabilities. Finally, our Corporate Platforms segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 11% organically, excluding the impact of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven primarily by the increased demand for our IR and ESG services and secondarily, due to the expansion of the issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises. Revenues in our IR and ESG services businesses increased 13% organically, underscoring the strong demand for our technology-based and consultative solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq's IR and ESG solutions increased 5% from the prior year period. Examining our IR ESG solutions more specifically, we have increased the number of companies using our ESG advisory services by 35% versus the prior year. We've also tripled the number of clients using our ESG workflow solutions to 170 companies, coming from both strong growth in one report and the acquisition of Metrio. Turning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 6% to $105 million as the number of Nasdaq listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 5% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings during the quarter with 28 operating company IPOs and a 90% win rate. Next, I want to touch briefly on the current market environment. As we enter the final months of 2022, we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. While we will remain vigilant and maintain flexibility to respond effectively to changing conditions, we believe we continue to be well positioned to deliver for our clients and our shareholders throughout the cycle. Our results continue to demonstrate the quality of our businesses and the value inherent in diversified model. We also continue to see compelling opportunities to further deepen relationships with our clients in this environment and expand the ways we support them as they navigate these dynamics. The new corporate structure we unveiled last month will serve as a great foundation, providing us even more opportunities to lean into areas most prime for growth and deliver even more holistic solutions to our clients across the ecosystem. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 9 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $890 million is the net result of organic growth of 9%, including a 10% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and an 8% organic increase in Market Services, partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% was unchanged compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $335 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared to $303 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 10. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenue totaled $699 million, an increase of 13%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 11 through 14. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $18 million or 16% with $7 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 18% in the period, and driven by both the anti-financial crime and market infrastructure technology businesses. Our market infrastructure technology business grew 6% as compared to the prior year period and 8% organically, excluding the impact of FX. This inflection reflects the progress we have made in advancing some of the largest client implementations through critical milestones earlier this year, new and expanded customer relationships and the lapping of a difficult comparable due to the planned rollout of a client support contract in the second half of 2021. This progress is an encouraging early proof point that the programs and initiatives of our market infrastructure technology team have been implementing will move this business forward. ARR for market technology totaled $456 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period and increased 6 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $12 million or 4%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $16 million or 6%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the index, analytics and market data businesses. Asset-based licensing revenues declined 6% compared to the prior year period and represented 61% of index revenues. AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes totaled $311 billion, a decline of 14% from the prior year period. ARR totaled $583 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% decreased 1 percentage point from the prior year period. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $13 million or 8% including 11% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listing services revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG and advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 7% or 5% excluding SPACs. Corporate Platforms ARR was $589 million and increased 11% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 44% increased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expenses due to the subdued IPO environment. Market Services net revenues increased $13 million or 4%. The organic revenue increase was $24 million or 8% and there was an $11 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth across trade management services, U.S. cash equity, equity derivatives and fixed. Turning to Page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $20 million to $417 million. The increase reflects a $40 million organic increase partially offset by a $19 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting two factors. First is our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases, which are reflected in the quarterly expense run rate starting in the second quarter. The increase is higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation, which we reflected in our guidance at the beginning of the year. We are lowering our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion, lowering both the top and the bottom of the prior range to reflect a combination of the continued strong organic growth dynamics as we progress through 2022, along with the impacts of a stronger dollar on our non-U.S. expenses. Lastly, we are lowering our 2022 tax guidance to a range of 24% to 25% versus 24% to 26% previously. Turning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $344 million versus 2Q '22, primarily due to net repayment of $222 million of commercial paper and a $123 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by the strengthening dollar. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.7x, down from 2.9x in the second quarter of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $99 million. As of September 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program. Turning to Page 17 of the presentation, I would like to touch on some of the very material progress we have made executing our sustainability strategy. I would like to note that Nasdaq's ESG reduction targets were approved by the science-based targets initiative. Our targets, including reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 100% by 2030 and absolute Scope 3 ESG emissions 95% by 2050. Additionally, EcoVadis upgraded our sustainability rating from silver to gold status, which is reserved for the top 5% of all companies rated. We also earned a place on Seramount's 100 Best Companies list, and were recognized as the best company for Dads for the second consecutive year. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you regularly on our progress. I would like to take a moment to discuss the new organizational alignment that we recently announced. On the Investor Relations website, we published a supplement to help with the financial reporting under the new corporate structure, which will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter 2022. The supplement covers the revenues, operating income and operating margin of each of the three new segments: market platforms, capital access platforms and anti-financial crime as well as revenues of their underlying businesses. In addition, I would also like to call your attention to a change in how we are grouping our recurring revenue segments collectively. In particular, we are now adding trade management services to the prior solutions segment grouping and calling it Solutions Businesses. The Solutions Businesses cover 75% of our last 12 months revenues and encompasses all of our non-trading revenues. At our Investor Day on November 8, we'll discuss our businesses, opportunities and strategy through the lens of this new corporate structure. And at that time, we will provide associated updates to our growth outlook and other objectives. As such, we will answer any questions regarding the revenue growth outlook on Investor Day. In closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect the continuation of the Company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment 9% organic revenue growth across the entire company and achieved a 53% non-GAAP operating margin. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I saw our first question comes from the line of Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRichard Repetto: And Adena and Ann, since you both -- Adena, you started with the corporate structure. So my question is, first, on the organic growth rate has been such an important yardstick as you did the strategic pivot. So I'm just trying to understand and maybe this is addressed what you sent out, but whether you're still committed to reporting market MIT or market infrastructure technology, the growth rate because it's going to get embedded in the market platforms? And that's the first part. And then the second on corporate structure. Do you see any conflict -- I know Tal call it well. He's highly respected but where you're selling technology to other exchanges and you're also competing -- potentially competing with them in the old market services business?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So with regard to the way that we're going to manage disclosures, Rich, we recognize the fact that we provided investors with a lot of visibility into the market infrastructure technology business for quite some time. And we intend to continue to provide periodic updates to investors to make sure they can continue to track our progress. Both in terms of revenue progress and overall progress against some of the goals and targets that we set at the 2020 Investor Day, and we'll discuss that at the Investor Day on November 8. So, we do recognize the need for us to continue to provide us disclosures as we're managing that business. I do want to say I think that with the market platforms construct with the divisional structure, it actually just increases the opportunities for us to find new ways to serve our market tech clients. And by thinking about us providing kind of an ecosystem orientation to delivering solutions to market tech clients, we hope that they see us as kind of a deeper partner in helping them navigate the kind of the modernization of markets, the way that you bring liquidity into markets, how you set up your infrastructure, et cetera. So, we're quite excited about how this can actually be an amplifier for the business. In terms of the conflict, we do very periodically have to manage through situations where we are providing market technology to a client in the same market in which we're competing. It's very rare, but it does happen. And we have a process and a governance structure internally, leveraging our risk management team, our legal team. And so those conflicts, we manage very actively. I think we've done a very good job of managing these conflicts very well over the years. And so that really doesn't change. It just -- it kind of moves under Tal's responsibility to think through those issues, continue to consult with John Zecca, our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer, obviously consult with me. So I just don't see any change in kind of how we're going to govern that going forward.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. I figured you'd want to continue reporting MIT growth, especially as it turned positive here this quarter, the organic growth.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Gautam Sawant from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGautam Sawant: Can you please expand on how your new initiatives in the digital asset space are complemented by some of the existing capabilities of the Nasdaq platform?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. I think that it's interesting because on the one hand, we are building a new custody solution from line one of code, but we are actually leveraging the -- what we're calling the marketplace services platform to support the liquidity capabilities that we're delivering on top of that custody solution. And so, we have an amazing technology organization. I mean, it really is incredible. And so what we're able to do is think about all the work we've done to establish Nasdaq's financial framework, establish the platform that's serving as our next-gen exchange platform and leverage that, but then adding this custody solution that's very specific to digital assets. And I think that, that allows us to understand -- we brought in some talent that's what I would call digital native talent to really support building the custody solution and yet they're working with our existing Market Tech team and to make sure that we're leveraging all of the capabilities we've been building over the last five years to support the liquidity that we're putting on top of the custody solution. And then I think in terms of also connectivity that we want to have with other exchanges, we provide the technology that powers nine crypto markets today. And so as we work with them and as we expand that client base, we hope that they see us as a good place for them to be able to custody their coin. And so, we obviously will have connectivity points to exchanges as well. And then I guess the last part is anti-fin crime. On Verafin and our trade surveillance business, we've developed out a crypto component, essentially modules that support all the anti-financial crime capabilities that you need in the crypto market. And so whether a digital wallet or your government wallet within a bank, we can support the bank and making sure that they're managing their credential crime risk. And then with regard to markets and trading firms that trade crypto, we have modules that are custom built specifically to manage the crypto surveillance. So all of those things together really put together kind of the complete suite of what we're offering the industry in crypto.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks so much for the color on the new segments, Adena, maybe if I could just ask one on that. I'm sure you'll cover this more on the Investor Day. But in general, do you view the re-segmenting internally I guess, is there going to be like a significant shift of personnel between the segments in terms of how they work together versus how they're working together right now. And then therefore, as a result of that, do you expect on potential revenue synergies and how they're working together in the new structure? And I guess also -- and if I can ask the same thing on the expense side, is it likely to drive some cost savings? Or in contrast, are there more growth opportunities that you may want to invest in as a result of the re-segmenting?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you. Yes. And we will cover that, I think, in more depth on Investor Day. So, we're excited to go through that and to make sure that you hear from Nelson and Tal and Jamie and the broader executive team as they're thinking through how we're going to manage the divisions going forward. But the whole purpose of the divisional structure is actually to unlock more opportunity to serve our customers. And we really thought long and hard as to how best to combine our organization so that we are looking at our customers outside in. And we're saying, okay, if you're a market participant, you're trading across Nasdaq's markets, and you're trading in all the markets in which we provide technology. When we think about the future infrastructure to support our markets, we're especially as we're moving into more of an edge cloud environment, and we're looking at developing our own data center into a local private zone and expanding what we can do to serve our ecosystem. We want to make sure we think about that both as a market operator and as a provider of technology and so that we can be more holistic in serving market participants and their needs. And then also making it so that we can really amplify the modernization markets with other exchanges, we have one technology stack now that didn't used to be the case. So, we now have one leading edge, we think, technology that really -- that underscores our exchanges and will underscore the exchanges that we provide technology to. And so, it allows us to think differently about how to serve those clients more holistically. So that's a market platforms. I think -- and therefore, that's a revenue opportunity to put it that way. And the way that those teams are going to work together is -- they're basically the leaders of the North American markets, European markets and Market Tech. They will serve as the key executive supporting Tal. And then we've actually moved the product engineering team under Brenda Hoffman into the division so that the technology organization will be able to work even more closely with the business, and we're moving product marketing into the division as well. So you've got kind of a more holistic way to run the business in an agile format. The same goes for capital access platforms, bringing investors and corporates closer together, thinking about the services that we offer to corporate to communicate to investors, well, what data could we offer investors to help them understand corporates better. How do we leverage our investment in Solovis technology platforms to make it to that asset owners and asset managers have better line of sight into trends such as ESG trends and other things where we're gathering a lot of data, and we're serving corporates well. So -- and then, of course, index products continue to be an area of just great imagination. We can do -- we've always done thematic indexes that underscore our role in the markets, and we'll continue to be able to do that. So I feel like there's, again, more that we can think about in terms of providing more services to investors treating investors also as corporates in terms of governance and IRs that they have in addition to finding new ways to serve our companies. So again, it's a revenue opportunity. And the businesses, Oliver and Jeff Thomas, who run those respective businesses, will report into Nelson and they will help him navigate that. And then lastly, again, the product engineering and marketing teams will be rolling into the division to create a more agile way to -- and more nimble way to move the business forward. So it is -- I just want to say the purpose of it is revenue opportunity. But the purpose of it also is to kind of make sure we're running these divisions as efficiently as possible, and that will be an evolution over time. And we're excited to be able to go through that with you in more detail at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Our question is on the equity options business. There were some positive market share trends in the business this quarter. Most of this was actually driven by the BX Option Exchange. So can you talk about what drove the sharp increase in volumes at this specific exchange?\nAdena Friedman: I can just say generally, Craig, we manage that business very actively. We think about what the strategies are that our clients are trying to execute on. We think about it both in terms of functionality and in terms of pricing. And as we've been really working to increase the utility of the BX Options market, I think that we've had a really good market share growth in general across that business. And I think that some of all the work that we've been doing foundationally to bring more participants in really came to fruition in the quarter. And so, you're seeing a nice uptick in market share there. But again, it's a very dynamic -- as you know, it's a very dynamic environment, and we are constantly vigilant in making sure that we're pricing our markets the right way to serve clients, and we're offering functionality that really meets their needs. And across the six divisions, we basically can serve the needs of any options market maker or market participants.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: I guess I wanted to touch on Verifin for a minute [Technical Difficulty] and the performance this quarter. I think I heard you say there are 54 new client sign-ups, which I think is a nice pick up from 37 last quarter. So wondering, can you give some color on the sales environment for Verafin as it relates to new customers, again in some sense, it's a bit counterintuitive just given the macro and uncertainty out there? But just curious, if anything has changed in terms of the customer acquisition or sales cycle. And then also, you mentioned some proof of concepts happening as well. Just also if you can update us on kind of the sales cycle from proof-of-concept to signing on a new customer?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. So one thing that we did at the end of last year within the anti-fin crimes business is we segmented the Verafin business into the small to medium banks and then what's the midsize to large banks. And we have two leaders that have really taken on responsibility for looking at each of those groups and those segments of clients. And I think that we did that work at the end of last year, and then we kind of put very specific programs in place to help amplify the growth characteristics in the small to medium bank space and then in the midsized to large bank space because the sales cycles are different. The approach to the product is different. And certainly, as we're moving up to the top tier banks, it's just -- it's a different process and a different orientation, and we wanted to make sure that we kept that machine going within the SMB banks while we also continue to evolve the organization to serve the bigger ones. And I think a lot of the things that we put in place at the beginning of the year for small to medium banks really have come to fruition. There's always a ton of focus on pipeline management, a ton of focus on client service, et cetera. And the sales cycles are relatively quick and the on-boarding is relatively quick. So I think you're just seeing the machine working really well. But I would also say you asked about the current environment, and this is how I look at software sales in an uncertain economic environment. I think, first of all, there is this driving trend across all industries and all segments towards automation and finding ways to do more with fewer people. And the employment environment is very tight. So if anything, banks are struggling to find personnel to be able to manage their financial crime risk so they want to bring in more technology. And technology generally and more automation will make them more efficient over time. So even in uncertain economic environment, you're still seeing generally strong demand for B2B software that that drives automation and allows for more efficiency. But even more powerful is when that software solution is easy to implement. It's a light lift. It's not costly to bring the solution in-house and it's not a big strain on your infrastructure. So cloud-based solutions, SaaS-based solutions are much in higher demand than heavy implementation on-prem solutions. And Verafin, therefore, kind of ticks every box, right? It takes every box for the small banks. It's an all-in-one platform solution that allows them to have much better crime management with fewer people. And then when you look at the largest banks, they're struggling with just an increasingly complex environment, and they need modules that can really help them be more efficient and more effective in finding criminals. And I think that Verafin can -- as it's scaling up to the top tiers, is looking at it more as a modular. They can come in and focus on wire fraud, ACH fraud, business e-mail compromise or they can do one of those things, they can do all of those things. But as banks are looking at their most acute problems, we're coming in with a solution that where we can show material improvement and their ability to manage it. And I think that, again, it's a SaaS-based cloud-based solution. So it's a light lift, light implementation against a really, really great result. So, the return on investment is high. And I think that's why we will be -- continue to be successful in managing through different economic environments. And we're very excited about how we're working with the large banks. That is a different sale. And our trade surveillance business has a lot of experience managing those complex sales, but those take a while. And we've known that from the very beginning. I think when we announced Verafin, we said that we have kind of a three-year view as to how we want to manage to start to penetrate the Tier 1s, and we think we're making great progress. But it takes time to sign those clients after showing that our product is offering them a really good return..\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: I wanted to talk about the revenue opportunity from the listings companies from all of the new IPOs over the last several years as they kind of come off the starter kit for a lot of the services that you provide for free. Is there a way to quantify things like ESG, and I think there's some IR and other services that is being utilized today, but are going to become potentially fee-paying services over the next handful of months and years. Is there -- I guess, just trying to help looking for ways to kind of quantify that opportunity?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. It's a good question. I think that if you -- we don't give very specific stats as to what the very specific conversion rate is. But I would say that, if you think about all of the IPOs and you kind of look at the ones that are -- probably had larger raises, they have a more established IR group and IR needs, I think that the conversion rate is very high because we do work very hard to prove our value during the three years that they are provided these services free of charge. And so, I think if you kind of take the number of companies went public and then you look at the companies that had larger capital raises, I think that you should assume that there's a really good conversion rate. I think as you look at the smaller, smaller listings that had lower capital raises, they're going to be a little bit more discerning as to which of the services they continue to take but all of them are an up-sell opportunity. And I think that our team does a really good job of really managing the clients well so that they really get great value. So it's a natural thing for them to say, you know what, we're going to continue to receive this value and we're willing to pay for it. But we don't provide specific stats. I just think you're going to have to kind of just look at the roll-off periods, look at the number of IPOs and then probably make some assumptions on conversion.\nDaniel Fannon: Just a follow-up. Is there a way to think about what number of services that you bundle in that starter kit beyond IRs part of it? Is it just so we get a sense?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, actually, it's regulated. So the suite of services is publicly available. It's some and it's basically you get to choose surveillance or targeting or perception you get, I think, a set number of seats. It's anywhere from, I think, one to three seats -- two seats or two seats for IR. And then the ESG reporting is really you're getting access to -- you can choose one report of Metrio in terms of providing data aggregation and reporting solutions. And so, that's actually out there in the public domain, you can kind of see what we're offering, and therefore, that would be what they would convert. Now during the three years, we worked really hard to show them that they might want to take the overall surveillance service, which is just giving them insights into who's buying and selling their stock, but they might want to take targeting or they might want to do a perception study. So, we do work with them to show them that there's incremental value they can receive even during the period.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Just going back to the anti-financial crime and the new segmenting is the way you think about forward growth here. Would this business probably coming in into more of a spotlight is it sort of a stand-alone is it sort of a stand-alone segment? How are you thinking about the trade-off and the opportunity on organic versus inorganic growth here? Obviously, it sounds like organic pipelines remain pretty robust given the efforts you have on the Tier 1 bank side. But should we think about M&A being a bigger part of the story now that it will be a separate segment?\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Alex. I think that when we -- first of all, we really spend the majority of our time really focused on organic growth. But as we look at opportunities for acquisitions and obviously, we'll be very discerning during this period of time to make sure that we're driving to a financial return and a strategic value, I think that we focus -- we're focusing our acquisition reviews in three key areas. It's really the modernization of markets and the idea of technology is serving the financial community. The second is in ESG and how we can continue to provide better capabilities for companies and investors to connect together to manage the complexity there. And then the third is on anti-financial crime. So I think that you will see that we're focused in making sure that we make smart and value-additive decisions if we're going to grow inorganically. I have to say, in anti-financial crime, as you said, there's a really great growth runway with the business as it is, and it's a very good and complete solution. But there may be ways to amplify that strategy or to go into more adjacencies in anti-fin crime over time, and we'll evaluate that. But it's something that we look at. We're looking at across all three themes as we're thinking about acquisitions going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Could you please talk about why you made the decision to get into digital asset custody space during -- in the middle of a crypto winter? I mean there are some other companies launching crypto solutions, but I would like to hear from you what Nasdaq is seeing in this market currently? And then for future products, what other products will make sense for Nasdaq down the road in the crypto space? And then, will Nasdaq build its own technology or you partner with third-party crypto custody or auto crypto companies to offer solutions to clients?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, just to answer the last question first. Our primary goal is to build our solutions to serve the industry because we're trying to bring more modern infrastructure into the digital asset space. So, our -- we want to make sure that what we deliver is hyper resilient, is industrialized like we do with our own markets and our market tech for other exchanges. And so, we are -- we see ourselves as a builder in the space, and we do think we can differentiate ourselves in that way. I think, Owen, how this came about? I think we started reviewing the digital asset space obviously years ago. But we really started to doing a deep dive as to how we could play a role in digital assets over the last 18 months. And I think that our view is that there are some very specific and acute pain points that keep institutions from engaging in digital assets. And yet we're really good at providing industrialized solutions and capabilities that drive institutional engagement in market. So, we decided to focus in on how can we provide infrastructure that helps drive adoption into the institutional community and how can we do it in a way that where we're not -- we're going to be conservative, but we're also going to be really, really thoughtful in making sure that we add value -- and we're not -- we did not want to go into the space and say, we're just going to be crypto exchange, 438 or whatever the number is, right? We wanted to make sure that we came in with something that's differentiated that institutions feel like they can use and they can rely on that's accessible, available, resilient, et cetera, and scalable. And so, we decided to start with custody because it's foundational to anything in digital assets. Safekeeping of the coin, in our opinion, is a foundational layer. And whether that's cryptocurrencies or NFTs or other digital assets, it's just something that we felt we needed to get good at and we needed to be able to deliver. As we think about solutions that we're going to add on top of that, the first one is this kind of institutional liquidity solution that -- it's not a continuous market. It's not driven -- it's not retail driven at all. It's really meant for institutions to be able to convert coins to be able to transfer coin from one exchange to another across the custody solution, et cetera, and it's a good entry point for us. What we're going to do going forward, though, Owen is going to depend on how successful we are with step one. So want to get launched. We want to make sure that we have the licenses that we need to operate successfully. And then, we will see gain some experience and then decide what's next for us. But we're excited to get into the space, but we're also doing it with our eyes wide open.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bond: Just wanted to follow up on U.S. options. So options volumes market-wide continued to be robust, and that's actually a nice uptick in market share. The pricing remain elevated all through the peers. So retail activity is obviously driving activity across the board, but it seems like Nasdaq also benefiting from higher catcher complex winters. So, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the size of the complex order market, how competitive it is and you're seeing significant growth there or most of the growth still coming from retail?\nAdena Friedman: I think that with regard to -- I would just say that the complex order functionality is relatively stable. I don't think we're seeing significant changes in demand for complex order functionality. It's become increasingly competitive over the years. It's hard to build, and it's hard to support. So we are -- honestly, we feel great about being in that space because we do it really well. And I think we have a truly differentiated exchange offering around complex sort of functionality. But it's not an area that kind of goes and swings very broadly from one quarter or one year to the next, and it's institutionally driven. But also remember that we also have our floor brokers in PHLX and our auction capabilities and kind of the ability to handle block trade as well. And that's a different exchange with different capabilities. And that market does ebb and flow a bit with institutional demand. And so -- and that also commands a different fee structure than the retail platforms. So, I think that you're probably seeing a combination of both, Andrew, in terms of helping -- in terms of both pricing and our market share. Nasdaq has -- I think one of the things we do differentiate ourselves on is the fact that we have retail-driven platforms, and we have institutionally driven platforms with a lot of different functionalities. So we can be a complete service provider -- so in any environment where the trends are different or retail engagement ebbs and flows, we still have the ability to manage flow from everyone. And I think right now, you're just seeing us operating in all cylinders across the options franchise.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman, CEO, for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Well, thank you very much for your time today. But before I conclude today's call, I would like to make sure you're aware of a change in our Investor Relations team. Specifically, Ed Ditmire has chosen to take on a new challenge as the Head of Investor Relations in a different sector, and this will be his last earnings call with us here at Nasdaq. Ed joined us in 2013, and he has been truly instrumental in shaping and improving our relationships with our investors throughout his tenure here. In nearly a 10-year time frame in which our stock delivered a 440% return, which is just an awesome track record for Ed. Along the way, Ed has become an integral part of the senior team at Nasdaq and has brought our investors into the room figuratively at least, as we've made important and impactful strategic decisions. We are launching a search for a new Head of Investor Relations, and we will provide an update once our new head of IR is selected. During the interim period, Neil Stratton will report directly to Ann Dennison, and he will be the primary contact for analysts and investors. I now want to turn the call now to you, Ed, for a few comments.\nEd Ditmire: Thank you, Adena, for the very kind words. Working for standout leaders like Adena and Ann, who were always curious about how we could improve as well as an entire management team, with the vision and execution shops to drive real change, kept everything perpetually exciting in my time here. And Nasdaq, I saw how creative, hard-working and humble teams can accomplish that much. And in particular, has been a very special to partner with Neil Stratton with his keen sense of what goes into a compelling investment and for sharing a really ambitious view of what's possible. To our especially discerning mostly reasonable and always entertaining a group of analysts and investors, thank you for being eager to engage for enduring my many arguments and for passing back so many valuable nuggets we used to improve. I'll get to the point. It's been a privilege to tell the incredible story of Nasdaq and its dedicated people, but nothing has been more satisfying than to see the substantial value that can be created when standout business performance was multiplied by the increasing respect earned from our investment community in the weeks to come and especially at our November Investor Day. I look forward to keeping the lines of communications open during this very exciting time and Nasda and then to continue our friendships for years behind. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And Ed will be with us at Investor Day where we'll have a chance to provide him a proper sendoff. But it is with sadness that we have to -- I don't make this announcement, but we're very excited for Ed. So, congratulations, Ed, on your new chapter, and your new adventure that you're going to be starting later in November. Well, in closing, Nasdaq's third quarter results demonstrate our strong execution thus far in 2022, and we look forward to speaking with you more about our future plans at our Investor Day. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I'll begin today with a summary of the new corporate structure for Nasdaq that we announced during the quarter. The new structure organizes our business units into the following three divisions that align us more closely to the foundational shifts that are driving our strategic evolution. Market Platforms led by Tal Cohen will include our North American and European market services as well as our market infrastructure technology business. The division will also include our digital assets and carbon markets businesses. Capital Access platforms led by Nelson Griggs will combine our corporate platforms and investment intelligence businesses. And Anti-Financial Crime led by Jamie King, will include Verafin, our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solution, as well as our market and trade surveillance business. Our new structure will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. As Ann will note later, we have provided supplemental information to help investors and analysts prepare for the financial and reporting implications of our new structure. This information is available on our IR website and was furnished in our Form 8-K filed this morning. Additionally, we will discuss our businesses through the lens of this new structure at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8. We believe the new structure will elevate our strategy and amplify our growth opportunities by allowing us to provide even more holistic solutions to our clients' most complex challenges. We view this as the next chapter in the strategic pivot that we launched five years ago, which solidified our focus on liquidity, transparency and integrity as the foundation of our strategic growth pillars. While these strategic themes are carried across our divisions, each division has a central theme that will help define its strategic focus. Market platforms will focus on maximizing the liquidity of the capital markets through our role as a market operator and as a provider of market ecosystems to our technology clients. This division will center around the modernization of markets, including the migration of markets and core infrastructure to the cloud and the emergence of blockchain and the resulting digital assets as elements of future market infrastructure. Nasdaq today serves as a powerful capital markets platform. We are a leading force in the modernization of marketplaces through our world-class technology, including the progress we're making as we migrate our own markets to our next-gen exchange platform in an edge cloud environment. We are also actively deploying our next-gen market platform to our market technology clients. And through our new structure, we see an opportunity for us to drive a broader strategy as one integrated unit. For instance, as we move forward with our digital assets platform, we see our role as being broader than a market operator or a market technology provider. It is a true platform opportunity, creating a custody foundation with strong anti-financial crime capabilities that allows multiple market venues, including those to whom we sell our market technology to connect and where we can facilitate institutional liquidity across venues more seamlessly than exist today. It's just one example of how the divisional structure will have more power, working together both as an operator and as a technology partner. We are excited to demonstrate how we can combine our expertise in managing market infrastructure coupled with our focus on leading technologies to support exchanges and market participants in new ways to drive the global flow of capital. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we will leverage the insights and capabilities across our corporate platforms and investment intelligence team. And we will be focused on the transparency pillar, reflecting the profound shift in behavior among corporates and investors with a focus on long-term value creation. We are seeing a sustained prioritization across the buy-side on long-term value creation and the subsequent response across corporates to engage their investor base in this evolving construct. For instance, there is a notable opportunity for Nasdaq to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate issuers by providing advisory services along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community. As we mature our strategy, we have an opportunity to bridge these capabilities into the investment community through analytics, indexes and data solutions. More generally, capital access platforms will be positioned to connect the investor and the issuer communities through actionable insights, industry-leading indexes and modernized workflows. This will allow us to provide more seamless, more holistic and more impactful solutions that help both stakeholder groups navigate the increasing complexity of the evolving financial system. And finally, our Anti-Financial Crime division will continue to focus on strengthening and safeguarding the integrity of the financial system. Anti-financial crime technology represents an already large and fast-growing sector with structural and regulatory tailwinds. And as the financial system transforms and becomes more technologically driven and sophisticated, the threats to its integrity are growing in scale and sophistication as well. Financial institutions face increasing -- I'm sorry, face significant challenges in detecting and preventing financial crime, and therefore, are investing significant capital and resources and combating those threats. Nasdaq's Anti-Financial Crime division focuses on delivering a world-class platform with holistic solutions and capabilities to support financial institutions and fighting financial crime more effectively across their networks and the wider financial system. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us to further lean into the areas that are prime for growth as we become the trusted fabric of the financial system. As I noted earlier, we will have an opportunity to provide more details and answer your questions about this new structure for Nasdaq at our upcoming Investor Day on November 8. Now let's turn to our results. Nasdaq delivered strong third quarter results with $890 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and a 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts of the changes in FX rates in acquisitions and divestitures. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 8% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $699 million in the third quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 13%. We are pleased with the continued consistent growth across our recurring revenue segments, complemented by positive organic contributions from other areas, including index licensing and trading. Turning next to the specific business highlights starting with our Solutions segment. Our Solutions segment delivered total revenue of $584 million during the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven from activity across the full breadth of our businesses, including our index and investment analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings and market infrastructure technology business as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total revenue in the third quarter, a 4% increase overall from the prior year period. Our organic growth was 6%, excluding the effect of FX, with contributions to organic growth from each of the three businesses during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business increased by 2% from the prior year period and 5% organically, excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients. Our index business saw revenue growth of 5% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $56 billion over the last 12 months. We also saw continued strong results from licensed futures activities, which, together with the impact of positive inflows more than offset the negative impact of market beta. In our Analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% organically, excluding the effect of FX. Our combined investment in Solovis offerings saw strong revenue growth driven by the sequential impact of new sales and client retention. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth for that team, which underscores the power of these offerings across both asset owners and asset managers. Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $132 million in total revenues in the third quarter, a 16% increase from the prior year period. This was driven by growth in both the anti-financial crime and the market infrastructure technology businesses. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a very encouraging third quarter with a 24% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by new sales across both our fraud and anti-money laundering and surveillance solutions as well as the $7 million impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the prior year period. Regarding Verafin specifically, we grew revenues 25%, excluding the $7 million impact of the deferred revenue write-down on the prior year period. We are particularly proud of the team's continued ability to sign new clients across small to medium banks, which is the core of the current franchise with 54 new small, medium banks clients signed during the quarter. We are also pleased by the results of recent proof of concepts with several Tier 1 banks. As an example, in one POC that we ran, we were able to reduce false positives by 25% by simultaneously identifying 3.5x more dollars in fraudulent payments. Moving next to our market infrastructure technology business. We generated $55 million in revenues, representing 8% organic growth. We are pleased to see the business return to positive organic growth versus the prior year period for the first time in over a year. We continue to be on track with large complex deliveries, and we have a strong pipeline of engaged clients and prospects. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $305 million during the third quarter, a 4% increase versus the prior year period or 8% higher organically, excluding the impact of FX. The increased revenue year-over-year was broad-based, with especially strong growth in trade management services, which had a record quarter and increases across each of our trading businesses, equity derivatives, cash equities and FICC. Lastly, we were excited to announce during the quarter the launch of our new digital assets business to power the digital asset ecosystem. This new business underscores our ambition to facilitate broader institutional participation in digital assets by providing trusted and institutional-grade solutions, focused on custody, liquidity and integrity. As part of our Market Services segment, Nasdaq Digital assets will initially develop and advanced custody solution, coupled with liquidity and execution capabilities geared to serving institutional clients by enabling safe transaction and storage of digital assets. This solution is developed through an innovation and innovative technology approach that brings together the best attributes of hot and cold crypto wallets, providing a high degree of accessibility without compromising security. Additionally, we will incorporate our anti-financial crime technology with new coverage for the cryptocurrency ecosystem, including a comprehensive suite of crypto-specific detection and investigation capabilities. Finally, our Corporate Platforms segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period or 11% organically, excluding the impact of FX and an acquisition. The growth was driven primarily by the increased demand for our IR and ESG services and secondarily, due to the expansion of the issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises. Revenues in our IR and ESG services businesses increased 13% organically, underscoring the strong demand for our technology-based and consultative solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq's IR and ESG solutions increased 5% from the prior year period. Examining our IR ESG solutions more specifically, we have increased the number of companies using our ESG advisory services by 35% versus the prior year. We've also tripled the number of clients using our ESG workflow solutions to 170 companies, coming from both strong growth in one report and the acquisition of Metrio. Turning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 6% to $105 million as the number of Nasdaq listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 5% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings during the quarter with 28 operating company IPOs and a 90% win rate. Next, I want to touch briefly on the current market environment. As we enter the final months of 2022, we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. While we will remain vigilant and maintain flexibility to respond effectively to changing conditions, we believe we continue to be well positioned to deliver for our clients and our shareholders throughout the cycle. Our results continue to demonstrate the quality of our businesses and the value inherent in diversified model. We also continue to see compelling opportunities to further deepen relationships with our clients in this environment and expand the ways we support them as they navigate these dynamics. The new corporate structure we unveiled last month will serve as a great foundation, providing us even more opportunities to lean into areas most prime for growth and deliver even more holistic solutions to our clients across the ecosystem. With that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details. Sure. So with regard to the way that we're going to manage disclosures, Rich, we recognize the fact that we provided investors with a lot of visibility into the market infrastructure technology business for quite some time. And we intend to continue to provide periodic updates to investors to make sure they can continue to track our progress. Both in terms of revenue progress and overall progress against some of the goals and targets that we set at the 2020 Investor Day, and we'll discuss that at the Investor Day on November 8. So, we do recognize the need for us to continue to provide us disclosures as we're managing that business. I do want to say I think that with the market platforms construct with the divisional structure, it actually just increases the opportunities for us to find new ways to serve our market tech clients. And by thinking about us providing kind of an ecosystem orientation to delivering solutions to market tech clients, we hope that they see us as kind of a deeper partner in helping them navigate the kind of the modernization of markets, the way that you bring liquidity into markets, how you set up your infrastructure, et cetera. So, we're quite excited about how this can actually be an amplifier for the business. In terms of the conflict, we do very periodically have to manage through situations where we are providing market technology to a client in the same market in which we're competing. It's very rare, but it does happen. And we have a process and a governance structure internally, leveraging our risk management team, our legal team. And so those conflicts, we manage very actively. I think we've done a very good job of managing these conflicts very well over the years. And so that really doesn't change. It just -- it kind of moves under Tal's responsibility to think through those issues, continue to consult with John Zecca, our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer, obviously consult with me. So I just don't see any change in kind of how we're going to govern that going forward. Sure. Sure. Yes. I think that it's interesting because on the one hand, we are building a new custody solution from line one of code, but we are actually leveraging the -- what we're calling the marketplace services platform to support the liquidity capabilities that we're delivering on top of that custody solution. And so, we have an amazing technology organization. I mean, it really is incredible. And so what we're able to do is think about all the work we've done to establish Nasdaq's financial framework, establish the platform that's serving as our next-gen exchange platform and leverage that, but then adding this custody solution that's very specific to digital assets. And I think that, that allows us to understand -- we brought in some talent that's what I would call digital native talent to really support building the custody solution and yet they're working with our existing Market Tech team and to make sure that we're leveraging all of the capabilities we've been building over the last five years to support the liquidity that we're putting on top of the custody solution. And then I think in terms of also connectivity that we want to have with other exchanges, we provide the technology that powers nine crypto markets today. And so as we work with them and as we expand that client base, we hope that they see us as a good place for them to be able to custody their coin. And so, we obviously will have connectivity points to exchanges as well. And then I guess the last part is anti-fin crime. On Verafin and our trade surveillance business, we've developed out a crypto component, essentially modules that support all the anti-financial crime capabilities that you need in the crypto market. And so whether a digital wallet or your government wallet within a bank, we can support the bank and making sure that they're managing their credential crime risk. And then with regard to markets and trading firms that trade crypto, we have modules that are custom built specifically to manage the crypto surveillance. So all of those things together really put together kind of the complete suite of what we're offering the industry in crypto. Great. Thank you. Yes. And we will cover that, I think, in more depth on Investor Day. So, we're excited to go through that and to make sure that you hear from Nelson and Tal and Jamie and the broader executive team as they're thinking through how we're going to manage the divisions going forward. But the whole purpose of the divisional structure is actually to unlock more opportunity to serve our customers. And we really thought long and hard as to how best to combine our organization so that we are looking at our customers outside in. And we're saying, okay, if you're a market participant, you're trading across Nasdaq's markets, and you're trading in all the markets in which we provide technology. When we think about the future infrastructure to support our markets, we're especially as we're moving into more of an edge cloud environment, and we're looking at developing our own data center into a local private zone and expanding what we can do to serve our ecosystem. We want to make sure we think about that both as a market operator and as a provider of technology and so that we can be more holistic in serving market participants and their needs. And then also making it so that we can really amplify the modernization markets with other exchanges, we have one technology stack now that didn't used to be the case. So, we now have one leading edge, we think, technology that really -- that underscores our exchanges and will underscore the exchanges that we provide technology to. And so, it allows us to think differently about how to serve those clients more holistically. So that's a market platforms. I think -- and therefore, that's a revenue opportunity to put it that way. And the way that those teams are going to work together is -- they're basically the leaders of the North American markets, European markets and Market Tech. They will serve as the key executive supporting Tal. And then we've actually moved the product engineering team under Brenda Hoffman into the division so that the technology organization will be able to work even more closely with the business, and we're moving product marketing into the division as well. So you've got kind of a more holistic way to run the business in an agile format. The same goes for capital access platforms, bringing investors and corporates closer together, thinking about the services that we offer to corporate to communicate to investors, well, what data could we offer investors to help them understand corporates better. How do we leverage our investment in Solovis technology platforms to make it to that asset owners and asset managers have better line of sight into trends such as ESG trends and other things where we're gathering a lot of data, and we're serving corporates well. So -- and then, of course, index products continue to be an area of just great imagination. We can do -- we've always done thematic indexes that underscore our role in the markets, and we'll continue to be able to do that. So I feel like there's, again, more that we can think about in terms of providing more services to investors treating investors also as corporates in terms of governance and IRs that they have in addition to finding new ways to serve our companies. So again, it's a revenue opportunity. And the businesses, Oliver and Jeff Thomas, who run those respective businesses, will report into Nelson and they will help him navigate that. And then lastly, again, the product engineering and marketing teams will be rolling into the division to create a more agile way to -- and more nimble way to move the business forward. So it is -- I just want to say the purpose of it is revenue opportunity. But the purpose of it also is to kind of make sure we're running these divisions as efficiently as possible, and that will be an evolution over time. And we're excited to be able to go through that with you in more detail at Investor Day. I can just say generally, Craig, we manage that business very actively. We think about what the strategies are that our clients are trying to execute on. We think about it both in terms of functionality and in terms of pricing. And as we've been really working to increase the utility of the BX Options market, I think that we've had a really good market share growth in general across that business. And I think that some of all the work that we've been doing foundationally to bring more participants in really came to fruition in the quarter. And so, you're seeing a nice uptick in market share there. But again, it's a very dynamic -- as you know, it's a very dynamic environment, and we are constantly vigilant in making sure that we're pricing our markets the right way to serve clients, and we're offering functionality that really meets their needs. And across the six divisions, we basically can serve the needs of any options market maker or market participants. Sure. Yes. So one thing that we did at the end of last year within the anti-fin crimes business is we segmented the Verafin business into the small to medium banks and then what's the midsize to large banks. And we have two leaders that have really taken on responsibility for looking at each of those groups and those segments of clients. And I think that we did that work at the end of last year, and then we kind of put very specific programs in place to help amplify the growth characteristics in the small to medium bank space and then in the midsized to large bank space because the sales cycles are different. The approach to the product is different. And certainly, as we're moving up to the top tier banks, it's just -- it's a different process and a different orientation, and we wanted to make sure that we kept that machine going within the SMB banks while we also continue to evolve the organization to serve the bigger ones. And I think a lot of the things that we put in place at the beginning of the year for small to medium banks really have come to fruition. There's always a ton of focus on pipeline management, a ton of focus on client service, et cetera. And the sales cycles are relatively quick and the on-boarding is relatively quick. So I think you're just seeing the machine working really well. But I would also say you asked about the current environment, and this is how I look at software sales in an uncertain economic environment. I think, first of all, there is this driving trend across all industries and all segments towards automation and finding ways to do more with fewer people. And the employment environment is very tight. So if anything, banks are struggling to find personnel to be able to manage their financial crime risk so they want to bring in more technology. And technology generally and more automation will make them more efficient over time. So even in uncertain economic environment, you're still seeing generally strong demand for B2B software that that drives automation and allows for more efficiency. But even more powerful is when that software solution is easy to implement. It's a light lift. It's not costly to bring the solution in-house and it's not a big strain on your infrastructure. So cloud-based solutions, SaaS-based solutions are much in higher demand than heavy implementation on-prem solutions. And Verafin, therefore, kind of ticks every box, right? It takes every box for the small banks. It's an all-in-one platform solution that allows them to have much better crime management with fewer people. And then when you look at the largest banks, they're struggling with just an increasingly complex environment, and they need modules that can really help them be more efficient and more effective in finding criminals. And I think that Verafin can -- as it's scaling up to the top tiers, is looking at it more as a modular. They can come in and focus on wire fraud, ACH fraud, business e-mail compromise or they can do one of those things, they can do all of those things. But as banks are looking at their most acute problems, we're coming in with a solution that where we can show material improvement and their ability to manage it. And I think that, again, it's a SaaS-based cloud-based solution. So it's a light lift, light implementation against a really, really great result. So, the return on investment is high. And I think that's why we will be -- continue to be successful in managing through different economic environments. And we're very excited about how we're working with the large banks. That is a different sale. And our trade surveillance business has a lot of experience managing those complex sales, but those take a while. And we've known that from the very beginning. I think when we announced Verafin, we said that we have kind of a three-year view as to how we want to manage to start to penetrate the Tier 1s, and we think we're making great progress. But it takes time to sign those clients after showing that our product is offering them a really good return.. Yes. It's a good question. I think that if you -- we don't give very specific stats as to what the very specific conversion rate is. But I would say that, if you think about all of the IPOs and you kind of look at the ones that are -- probably had larger raises, they have a more established IR group and IR needs, I think that the conversion rate is very high because we do work very hard to prove our value during the three years that they are provided these services free of charge. And so, I think if you kind of take the number of companies went public and then you look at the companies that had larger capital raises, I think that you should assume that there's a really good conversion rate. I think as you look at the smaller, smaller listings that had lower capital raises, they're going to be a little bit more discerning as to which of the services they continue to take but all of them are an up-sell opportunity. And I think that our team does a really good job of really managing the clients well so that they really get great value. So it's a natural thing for them to say, you know what, we're going to continue to receive this value and we're willing to pay for it. But we don't provide specific stats. I just think you're going to have to kind of just look at the roll-off periods, look at the number of IPOs and then probably make some assumptions on conversion. Sure. Well, actually, it's regulated. So the suite of services is publicly available. It's some and it's basically you get to choose surveillance or targeting or perception you get, I think, a set number of seats. It's anywhere from, I think, one to three seats -- two seats or two seats for IR. And then the ESG reporting is really you're getting access to -- you can choose one report of Metrio in terms of providing data aggregation and reporting solutions. And so, that's actually out there in the public domain, you can kind of see what we're offering, and therefore, that would be what they would convert. Now during the three years, we worked really hard to show them that they might want to take the overall surveillance service, which is just giving them insights into who's buying and selling their stock, but they might want to take targeting or they might want to do a perception study. So, we do work with them to show them that there's incremental value they can receive even during the period. Thanks, Alex. I think that when we -- first of all, we really spend the majority of our time really focused on organic growth. But as we look at opportunities for acquisitions and obviously, we'll be very discerning during this period of time to make sure that we're driving to a financial return and a strategic value, I think that we focus -- we're focusing our acquisition reviews in three key areas. It's really the modernization of markets and the idea of technology is serving the financial community. The second is in ESG and how we can continue to provide better capabilities for companies and investors to connect together to manage the complexity there. And then the third is on anti-financial crime. So I think that you will see that we're focused in making sure that we make smart and value-additive decisions if we're going to grow inorganically. I have to say, in anti-financial crime, as you said, there's a really great growth runway with the business as it is, and it's a very good and complete solution. But there may be ways to amplify that strategy or to go into more adjacencies in anti-fin crime over time, and we'll evaluate that. But it's something that we look at. We're looking at across all three themes as we're thinking about acquisitions going forward. Sure. Well, just to answer the last question first. Our primary goal is to build our solutions to serve the industry because we're trying to bring more modern infrastructure into the digital asset space. So, our -- we want to make sure that what we deliver is hyper resilient, is industrialized like we do with our own markets and our market tech for other exchanges. And so, we are -- we see ourselves as a builder in the space, and we do think we can differentiate ourselves in that way. I think, Owen, how this came about? I think we started reviewing the digital asset space obviously years ago. But we really started to doing a deep dive as to how we could play a role in digital assets over the last 18 months. And I think that our view is that there are some very specific and acute pain points that keep institutions from engaging in digital assets. And yet we're really good at providing industrialized solutions and capabilities that drive institutional engagement in market. So, we decided to focus in on how can we provide infrastructure that helps drive adoption into the institutional community and how can we do it in a way that where we're not -- we're going to be conservative, but we're also going to be really, really thoughtful in making sure that we add value -- and we're not -- we did not want to go into the space and say, we're just going to be crypto exchange, 438 or whatever the number is, right? We wanted to make sure that we came in with something that's differentiated that institutions feel like they can use and they can rely on that's accessible, available, resilient, et cetera, and scalable. And so, we decided to start with custody because it's foundational to anything in digital assets. Safekeeping of the coin, in our opinion, is a foundational layer. And whether that's cryptocurrencies or NFTs or other digital assets, it's just something that we felt we needed to get good at and we needed to be able to deliver. As we think about solutions that we're going to add on top of that, the first one is this kind of institutional liquidity solution that -- it's not a continuous market. It's not driven -- it's not retail driven at all. It's really meant for institutions to be able to convert coins to be able to transfer coin from one exchange to another across the custody solution, et cetera, and it's a good entry point for us. What we're going to do going forward, though, Owen is going to depend on how successful we are with step one. So want to get launched. We want to make sure that we have the licenses that we need to operate successfully. And then, we will see gain some experience and then decide what's next for us. But we're excited to get into the space, but we're also doing it with our eyes wide open. I think that with regard to -- I would just say that the complex order functionality is relatively stable. I don't think we're seeing significant changes in demand for complex order functionality. It's become increasingly competitive over the years. It's hard to build, and it's hard to support. So we are -- honestly, we feel great about being in that space because we do it really well. And I think we have a truly differentiated exchange offering around complex sort of functionality. But it's not an area that kind of goes and swings very broadly from one quarter or one year to the next, and it's institutionally driven. But also remember that we also have our floor brokers in PHLX and our auction capabilities and kind of the ability to handle block trade as well. And that's a different exchange with different capabilities. And that market does ebb and flow a bit with institutional demand. And so -- and that also commands a different fee structure than the retail platforms. So, I think that you're probably seeing a combination of both, Andrew, in terms of helping -- in terms of both pricing and our market share. Nasdaq has -- I think one of the things we do differentiate ourselves on is the fact that we have retail-driven platforms, and we have institutionally driven platforms with a lot of different functionalities. So we can be a complete service provider -- so in any environment where the trends are different or retail engagement ebbs and flows, we still have the ability to manage flow from everyone. And I think right now, you're just seeing us operating in all cylinders across the options franchise. Well, thank you very much for your time today. But before I conclude today's call, I would like to make sure you're aware of a change in our Investor Relations team. Specifically, Ed Ditmire has chosen to take on a new challenge as the Head of Investor Relations in a different sector, and this will be his last earnings call with us here at Nasdaq. Ed joined us in 2013, and he has been truly instrumental in shaping and improving our relationships with our investors throughout his tenure here. In nearly a 10-year time frame in which our stock delivered a 440% return, which is just an awesome track record for Ed. Along the way, Ed has become an integral part of the senior team at Nasdaq and has brought our investors into the room figuratively at least, as we've made important and impactful strategic decisions. We are launching a search for a new Head of Investor Relations, and we will provide an update once our new head of IR is selected. During the interim period, Neil Stratton will report directly to Ann Dennison, and he will be the primary contact for analysts and investors. I now want to turn the call now to you, Ed, for a few comments. Yes. And Ed will be with us at Investor Day where we'll have a chance to provide him a proper sendoff. But it is with sadness that we have to -- I don't make this announcement, but we're very excited for Ed. So, congratulations, Ed, on your new chapter, and your new adventure that you're going to be starting later in November. Well, in closing, Nasdaq's third quarter results demonstrate our strong execution thus far in 2022, and we look forward to speaking with you more about our future plans at our Investor Day. Thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 9 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $890 million is the net result of organic growth of 9%, including a 10% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and an 8% organic increase in Market Services, partially offset by a 3% negative impact from changes in FX rates and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 7%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 53% was unchanged compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $335 million or $0.68 per diluted share compared to $303 million or $0.59 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 10. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 8% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenue totaled $699 million, an increase of 13%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 11 through 14. Starting with Market Technology. Revenue increased $18 million or 16% with $7 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 18% in the period, and driven by both the anti-financial crime and market infrastructure technology businesses. Our market infrastructure technology business grew 6% as compared to the prior year period and 8% organically, excluding the impact of FX. This inflection reflects the progress we have made in advancing some of the largest client implementations through critical milestones earlier this year, new and expanded customer relationships and the lapping of a difficult comparable due to the planned rollout of a client support contract in the second half of 2021. This progress is an encouraging early proof point that the programs and initiatives of our market infrastructure technology team have been implementing will move this business forward. ARR for market technology totaled $456 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 15% in the period and increased 6 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $12 million or 4%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $16 million or 6%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects positive contributions from the index, analytics and market data businesses. Asset-based licensing revenues declined 6% compared to the prior year period and represented 61% of index revenues. AUM and exchange-traded products linked to Nasdaq indexes totaled $311 billion, a decline of 14% from the prior year period. ARR totaled $583 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 64% decreased 1 percentage point from the prior year period. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $13 million or 8% including 11% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listing services revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG and advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 7% or 5% excluding SPACs. Corporate Platforms ARR was $589 million and increased 11% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 44% increased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expenses due to the subdued IPO environment. Market Services net revenues increased $13 million or 4%. The organic revenue increase was $24 million or 8% and there was an $11 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth across trade management services, U.S. cash equity, equity derivatives and fixed. Turning to Page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $20 million to $417 million. The increase reflects a $40 million organic increase partially offset by a $19 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $1 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting two factors. First is our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases, which are reflected in the quarterly expense run rate starting in the second quarter. The increase is higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation, which we reflected in our guidance at the beginning of the year. We are lowering our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.70 billion to $1.72 billion, lowering both the top and the bottom of the prior range to reflect a combination of the continued strong organic growth dynamics as we progress through 2022, along with the impacts of a stronger dollar on our non-U.S. expenses. Lastly, we are lowering our 2022 tax guidance to a range of 24% to 25% versus 24% to 26% previously. Turning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $344 million versus 2Q '22, primarily due to net repayment of $222 million of commercial paper and a $123 million decrease in Eurobond book values caused by the strengthening dollar. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.7x, down from 2.9x in the second quarter of 2022. During the third quarter of 2022, the Company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $99 million. As of September 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the board authorized share repurchase program. Turning to Page 17 of the presentation, I would like to touch on some of the very material progress we have made executing our sustainability strategy. I would like to note that Nasdaq's ESG reduction targets were approved by the science-based targets initiative. Our targets, including reducing Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 100% by 2030 and absolute Scope 3 ESG emissions 95% by 2050. Additionally, EcoVadis upgraded our sustainability rating from silver to gold status, which is reserved for the top 5% of all companies rated. We also earned a place on Seramount's 100 Best Companies list, and were recognized as the best company for Dads for the second consecutive year. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you regularly on our progress. I would like to take a moment to discuss the new organizational alignment that we recently announced. On the Investor Relations website, we published a supplement to help with the financial reporting under the new corporate structure, which will take effect by the end of the fourth quarter 2022. The supplement covers the revenues, operating income and operating margin of each of the three new segments: market platforms, capital access platforms and anti-financial crime as well as revenues of their underlying businesses. In addition, I would also like to call your attention to a change in how we are grouping our recurring revenue segments collectively. In particular, we are now adding trade management services to the prior solutions segment grouping and calling it Solutions Businesses. The Solutions Businesses cover 75% of our last 12 months revenues and encompasses all of our non-trading revenues. At our Investor Day on November 8, we'll discuss our businesses, opportunities and strategy through the lens of this new corporate structure. And at that time, we will provide associated updates to our growth outlook and other objectives. As such, we will answer any questions regarding the revenue growth outlook on Investor Day. In closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect the continuation of the Company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered 10% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment 9% organic revenue growth across the entire company and achieved a 53% non-GAAP operating margin. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ed Ditmire, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEd Ditmire: Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq\u2019s second quarter 2022 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I\u2019d like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq\u2019s second quarter 2022 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made to drive forward our strategic priorities for the year. I\u2019d like to begin by acknowledging that we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Yet while markets, investors and corporate clients all experienced increased levels of volatility during the second quarter, Nasdaq\u2019s strategic vision and our ability to execute on it remains clear. The strength and quality of our businesses puts us in an excellent position to navigate these dynamics. Our record net revenue and non-GAAP EPS results demonstrate our ability to capture new opportunities in different operating environments even as we continue to strengthen our positioning for longer-term growth through focused investments. I am proud of our team\u2019s focus on delivering consistent results to our clients against this dynamic backdrop. Let\u2019s turn to our results. I am very pleased to report Nasdaq\u2019s strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $893 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts and changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled \u2013 sorry, $679 million in the second quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 12%, which reflects strong demand for our anti-financial crime solutions and investment analytics offerings. SaaS revenue now comprises 35% of total company ARR, a new high. The consistent growth we are seeing in our recurring revenue segments provides a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across with our index licensing and trading revenues. Turning next to specific highlights from our business segments, our Solutions segment delivered combined total revenue of $582 million during the second quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year period or 12%, excluding the impact of FX. The growth was driven from activity across several of our businesses, including our index and analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings, as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $283 million in total revenue in the second quarter, an 8% overall increase from the prior year period and 10%, excluding the impact of FX with growth contributions from across the businesses during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business increased by 1% from the prior year period and 3% excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients. In our index business, we saw revenue growth of $17 million or 16% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $71 billion over the last 12 months, including $25 billion of inflows during the especially challenging beta environment experienced in the first half of 2022. We also saw especially strong results from license features activities, which together with inflows, more than offset the negative impact of market beta. And in our analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% excluding the impact of FX. Our flagship eVestment analytics offerings saw continued strong user adoption, both across our asset owners and asset managers and drove annualized SaaS revenues for the Investment Intelligence segment to increase 12% versus the prior year period to $215 million. Turning next to our Market Technology segment, we delivered $131 million in total revenues in the second quarter, a 12% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our broader anti-financial crime technology solutions business. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a strong second quarter with a 29% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by sales in our fraud and anti-money laundering, or what we call FRAML solutions, as well as the impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the second \u2013 in the prior year period. We welcomed 37 new clients during the quarter. We continue to gain momentum with our efforts to expand Verafin\u2019s presence with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks through our proof-of-concept trials. These are active evaluations within our prospective client\u2019s compliance infrastructures. While this diligence process results in a relatively long technology purchasing cycle, it is an important step to drive our success in extending our solutions to this area of the market. Moving next to our Market Infrastructure Technology business, we generated $56 million in net revenues during the second quarter. Importantly, we made continued progress on the deliverables within a group of particularly large client projects that we have discussed in recent quarters, reflecting our increased ability to work with clients on site. Specifically, we completed Phase 1 deliveries for all four of our largest implementations by the end of the quarter. While some of the projects have follow-on phases, we are pleased to have met these important milestones so far this year. Market Infrastructure Technology also had some exciting new relationships that were announced during the period. In May, SP, a provider of financial products and services in Brazil, announced the development of their new trading platform for digital assets, which is leveraging Nasdaq\u2019s next-gen technology deployed as a SaaS solution in the cloud. In June, Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based marketplace for carbon credits, announced their decision to leverage Nasdaq\u2019s SaaS-based marketplace services platform to power their new spot exchange for carbon credits, which is slated for launch in early 2023. As I noted earlier, we are actively engaging in person with our clients again and the team recently welcomed over 100 officials from 50 global marketplaces to our Annual Technology of the Future Industry Conference. The overall sentiment from clients there was incredibly encouraging, particularly as the market infrastructure operators see the advantages that our technology, including our cloud deployed solutions, can bring to their respective customers as they contemplate shifts in their operating models and look for new ways to differentiate their offerings. We remain confident in our ability to improve our organic growth through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $310 million during the second quarter. We maximized opportunities presented by robust levels of activity through strong market share and consistent pricing strategies. The share volume traded on Nasdaq Exchanges grew by 22% compared to the prior year quarter. And trade management services revenues hit a new quarterly high of $87 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in demand for connectivity and infrastructure services. At the end of June, Nasdaq\u2019s Closing Cross set a record for the number of shares traded during the 2022 Russell U.S. Indexes Reconstitution, 3.3 billion shares, representing nearly $64 billion were executed in two seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities, a 40% increase in shares crossed from last year\u2019s event. I am incredibly proud of our market services team on achieving yet this important milestone. The new Closing Cross record is a testament to the investments we have made in our technology and a result of the trust the team has worked diligently to build with all investors, including through some of the most volatile market periods on record. Nasdaq\u2019s Nordic equities markets also saw strong volumes as well. The value of our shares traded on Nasdaq\u2019s Nordic and Baltic markets for the first half of 2022 was the second highest since 2008. Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the second quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our expanded listed issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services. Revenues in our IR and ESG services business increased 9%, underscoring the strong demand for our consultative and technology-based solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq\u2019s IR and ESG services solutions increased 6% from the prior year period, while you have also been expanding relationships of existing clients. In addition, during the second quarter, we acquired Metrio, a provider of corporate sustainability data analytics and reporting services to corporates. Metrio\u2019s SaaS-based platform is complementary to our existing suite of IR \u2013 I am sorry, of ESG reporting solutions and will accelerate our ability to support corporate clients and their expanding sustainability management and reporting needs. Our growing expertise in all components of E S and G enable us to help our corporate clients confidently navigate the complexity of the modern capital markets, including managing their investor relationships more successfully. Turning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 15% to $107 million as the number of Nasdaq-listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 9% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings for the 34th consecutive quarter, with 38 IPOs raising a combined $2.8 billion for an 88% win rate. In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also welcomed 25 new listings. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our second quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq\u2019s client-centric culture and diversified business model provides us the stability to perform well in different market environments. As we enter the second half of 2022, we continue to focus on broadening opportunities within three major areas that align with our strategic evolution. First, under the pillar of liquidity, we are a leader in the modernization of marketplaces through our world class technology. This includes the progress we are making as we migrate our own markets to a cloud-enabled state, including the planned migration of our MRX Options market in the fourth quarter of this year as well as our efforts to enable more of our market infrastructure technology clients to maximize cloud and other powerful technologies within their offerings. Second, under the pillar of transparency, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned to execute on our unique and substantial opportunity to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate clients by providing advisory services along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community. And third, under the pillar of integrity, we play an important role in seeking to make the entire financial system more safe and fair for savers and investors through our powerful and diverse anti-financial crime offerings combined with our network of bank and brokerage clients. We remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy and we believe that Nasdaq is well-positioned to navigate the geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward into the latter half of this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 10 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $893 million is the net result of organic growth of 9%, including a 12% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and a 4% organic increase in Market Services partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 6%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 54% was unchanged compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $342 million or $2.07 per diluted share compared to $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 11, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $679 million, an increase of 12%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 12 through 15. Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $14 million or 12% with $10 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 14% in the period and was driven by the anti-financial crime business, though market infrastructure technology saw a sequential improvement. ARR for Market Technology totaled $451 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 12% in the period. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $22 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $25 million or 10%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects primarily strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as positive contribution from market data. ARR totaled $586 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. Our index revenues were up 16% compared to the prior year, due principally to higher revenues derived from Nasdaq licensed derivative products, where we saw the benefit of both higher trading volumes in the products as well as hitting the revenue threshold that triggers a step up in licensing economics, which happened about a month earlier in the year than we did in 2021. Based on the strength in the futures side of index licensing during the period, the percentage of index revenues from AUM-based licensing was 5 percentage points lower than the approximate two-thirds level we typically speak about. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 66% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $19 million or 13%, including 16% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 11% or 9%, excluding SPAC. Corporate Platforms ARR was $586 million and increased 15% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 46% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expense due to the subdued IPO environment. Market Services net revenues increased $2 million or 1%. The organic revenue increase was $11 million or 4% and there was $9 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth in trade management services, equity derivatives and cash equity revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% was unchanged from the prior year period. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $21 million to $413 million. The increase reflects a $42 million organic increase partially offset by a $17 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $4 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting two factors. First is our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases, which is reflected in the quarterly expense run-rate starting in the second quarter. The merit increase was higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation and we have built the higher increase into our guidance at the beginning of the year. We continue to make significant investments in this tightened labor market to attract and retain the top talent in our industry. We are narrowing our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, tightening both the top and bottom of the prior range to account for expectations of continued investments, current FX rates and the continued strong performance thus far in 2022. Turning to Slide 17, debt decreased by $182 million versus 1Q \u201822, primarily due to our repayment of the $499 million \u2013 repayment of $499 million of the 4.25% senior unsecured notes due June 2024, partially offset by a net issuance of $421 million of commercial paper and a $105 million decrease in Eurobond\u2019s book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.9x, down from 3.1x in the first quarter of 2022. Let me take a moment now to update you on the dividend, stock repurchases and our Board approval to split our stock. During the second quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $166 million in shares and paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. We have successfully completed the share repurchase program to offset dilution related to the divestiture of our U.S. fixed income business in June of 2021. As of June 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. I am also pleased to announce that our Board approved and declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. As we had previously disclosed, the approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to permit us to effect the stock dividend required the approval of both the SEC and our shareholders. We received both approvals last month and filed the charter amendment yesterday. The record date for the stock dividend will be August 12, with a distribution date of August 26, and we expect trading to begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 29. Turning to Page 18 of the presentation, I\u2019d like to touch on some of the very material progress we\u2019ve made executing on our sustainability strategy. First, in terms of external impact. As Adena mentioned, we announced and closed on the Metrio acquisition in June, expanding our corporate serving ESG solution set, which will complement the more framework-based approach of our existing OneReport solution. Second, in terms of corporate sustainability, we published our annual sustainability and TCFD reports in June. On advancing our climate strategy, we have had our 2021 GHG emissions verified by a third party and submitted our science-based targets to the Science-based Targets Initiative for official validation. Lastly, in July, we received a two-level upgrade of our MSCI ESG rating to AA, recognizing the overall strength of our sustainability profile including our leading governance standards in particular. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you on our progress regularly. In closing, Nasdaq\u2019s second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company\u2019s ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 12% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 54% non-GAAP operating margin, resulting in what we see as strong momentum thus far in 2022 that we can build upon moving forward. Thank you for your time, and I\u2019ll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Adena and good morning, Ann. I guess first question is, Adena, on regulation. And I\u2019m sure you had a chance to sort of digest Chair Gansler\u2019s comments about equity market structure that he made just over a month ago. So I guess, by and large look at it as a modest positive for exchanges, but bringing more volume back to venues, at least that\u2019s just intention anyway. But I\u2019m just trying to see what you thought because he was critical of exchange rebates. And was there anything that particular \u2013 in particular stood out to you as noteworthy or that you might \u2013 that could be unintended consequences because if you put out, I think, five or six different areas you want to focus on.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. Rich, it\u2019s great to hear from you. And I would say that with regard to the market structure discussions and proposals that we\u2019re seeing, first of all, we have a long way to go because we haven\u2019t yet actually seen formal proposals. But as we\u2019re listening to Chair Gensler and understanding where he\u2019s focused, I think that we\u2019re, first and foremost, pleased that he does really recognize the value of exchanges and competition in lit markets. He\u2019s really focused on strengthening the National Best Bid offer so that investors have a really solid understanding of true supply and demand in the market at all times. And he\u2019s really focused in on transparency in terms of transparency around best execution, disclosure of execution quality, and really focusing on how to bring more orders into the lit venues because, and that\u2019s also focused on leveling the playing field from a competitive perspective between exchanges and dark pools. So overall, we see what he\u2019s trying to achieve, we think is beneficial to investors. I think as we look at some of the incentive structures that he\u2019s focused on, obviously, we see great value in the rebate structure that we have on exchanges because it really incentivizes participants to put their quotes into a lit venue and make those quotes available on the national \u2013 as part of the National Best Bid offer, so the incentive structure is really literally designed to support lit quotes and lit orders. But I think that generally speaking, we still have a long way to go to understand what all the proposals will be. And then, of course, that then starts a long process around the comments in the industry engagements to determine what a final proposal would look like. So it\u2019s just the beginning, but we are encouraged by a lot of the areas that he\u2019s focused on.\nRich Repetto: Got it. And I don\u2019t know whether this qualifies as a necessary follow-up or not. But I guess just looking at your expense guidance, you narrowed it a bit. but second half expenses would still be up 5% more than the first half. So any color and just your expense control this quarter was pretty stand out. Anything why the 5% increase in the back half or more color behind it?\nAnn Dennison: Sure, Rich. So just back to sort of how we think about expenses in the context of revenue growth, we align our medium-term outlook for our Solutions segment revenues is 6% to 9%. And then against that, we think about a 3% to 6% expense growth. Coming into the year, we did \u2013 we talked about and built into our guidance an additional 2% to reflect inflationary factors as well as the cost of return to office and travel, et cetera. And so that\u2019s all built into the guidance. There is some variability in the way that things come in throughout the year. And so when you look at the second quarter, there is a couple of things, FX, taking that down and just variability and the timing of accruals. And so as we look forward to the back half of the year, we\u2019d expect to come in depending on performance, either at the midpoint or towards the top end of our expense guidance range. And just like in past years, we\u2019d expect an increase in 3Q and that to be even higher in 4Q, where we have some seasonality in expenses.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I think it\u2019s also just really important to note that in the last eight consecutive quarters, we\u2019ve had double-digit growth in our Solutions segment. So we thought have been exceeding the overall medium-term outlook that we\u2019ve been providing in those segments, which then, of course, really makes us make sure that we have the right personnel and the right team to be able to support that growth, not only in terms of having all these new clients that we\u2019re now servicing from the growth that we\u2019ve experienced, but also continue to make investments in the businesses to continue to drive the growth that they are hoping to achieve. So all of that is reflected in the guidance and in addition to, obviously, the performance we\u2019ve shown so far.\nRich Repetto: Got it. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. Just going into the technology segment for a second, you ran through a lot of numbers there, and I think I may have missed some. But can you perhaps help us isolating the growth in the financial crime segment that, that was a little bit softer than I thought. But maybe help us how Verafin did in particular on a standalone basis and maybe what\u2019s going on in the legacy financial crime businesses. So any color around what\u2019s happening in those businesses and the numbers would be helpful? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So we do provide the numbers now on that \u2013 the basis of that sub-segment, which is anti-fin crime. But if I give some color around on the two components, so there is two components to the anti-fin crime business today. One is the Verafin business, which is the Fraud and AML detection and investigation technology; and the other is our market surveillance and trade surveillance business. And both of them continue to have healthy growth and healthy engagement with clients. I think that as we look at that business, just like we do with Market Tech, we look at it over a 12-month period, not so much quarter by quarter. But it is also probably worth noting that in the second quarter of last year, Verafin had a truly outsized growth quarter. And so we\u2019re trying \u2013 we\u2019re looking at that in the context of the current quarter in the context of that very outsized quarter last Q2. I think in general, as you mentioned, we are seeing continued strong growth across Verafin. We expect Verafin to continue throughout the year to perform along the lines of where we \u2013 what we\u2019ve been discussing with all of our investors since we bought Verafin. And we also are seeing really good engagement with the Tier 1 banks to try to deliver those services up market. I think the one thing about that is that the sales cycles with those Tier 1 banks are long. And we know that. I mean we obviously serve Tier 1s with our surveillance solutions. Just getting through the contracting process can take time. And that can create a little bit more variability quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate there. But we see really strong performance around the SME banks, the smaller banks, the midsized banks, fin-techs and now really engaging more and more with the Tier 1 banks. With regard to the trade surveillance and market surveillance business, trade surveillance continues to have really great engagement in terms of renewing contracts, expanding contracts. We now have a crypto trading module that we\u2019re \u2013 we have \u2013 we signed our first client around. And we also \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to invest in that business. I think the market surveillance part of that business is a little bit of slower growth business, and it always has been, always will be at a smaller client set. And there, we had, I would say, more of a kind of a flat quarter \u2013 year-over-year quarter experience. So I think all of that adds up, Alex, to what you saw. And I think that we \u2013 but we continue to see great momentum in the business.\nAlex Kramm: Very good color. Thank you for that. And then just a quick one, on the Analytics business, not to be too nitpicky here, but the analytics business, I think the dollar revenues were flat literally over the last three quarters. I didn\u2019t think there was a lot of FX in there, but maybe I\u2019m wrong about this. So just anything that\u2019s happening in this environment that I should be aware of or maybe it\u2019s just FX?\nAdena Friedman: Yes, no. It\u2019s \u2013 well, it\u2019s a combination of things. So I\u2019m going to try to answer some of it. I\u2019m going to hand it to Ann to make sure I give you a complete answer. But I think the first thing is investment continues to have good growth. They continue to sign new clients and continue to grow and expand what they are doing. And that shows up incrementally every quarter sequentially. Obviously, there are going to be some quarters that are stronger than others just in terms of sales and expansions of our contracts. I think, though, that what you\u2019ve got a couple of dynamics under the surface that one is just we have now some revenue associated with running programs around secondary transactions for private equity funds, and that showed up in the first quarter. And then I think there was something else in the fourth quarter. Was it FX or...\nAnn Dennison: It\u2019s not FX. We have a couple of other small non-recurring items that tipped over the rounding. So there is a little bit of noise behind it. But the core of the analytics business, the asset owner solutions are growing as expected.\nAlex Kramm: Okay, we can flush it out later. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, great. Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. I\u2019ll bundle two questions into one, they are related. Solutions segment organic growth. Adena, you get this question a lot. I know on the 6% to 9% growth. And obviously, you\u2019ve been tracking a little ahead of that again this quarter as well. So just maybe in thinking \u2013 my guess is you\u2019re not changing that 6% to 9%, but maybe just talk about your optimism of continuing to exceed that level given some of the organic growth initiatives that you\u2019re talking about in market infrastructure and new opportunities for infrastructure for trading venues that are outside your norm? And then the Tier 1, 2 bank cross-sell, realizing, of course, that cycle is longer. But you\u2019re starting in right now, obviously, with a stronger organic growth rate. So what \u2013 I guess, what would drive that Rate Solutions organic growth rate down into that 6% to 9% given a lot of the opportunities you have? And then the related follow-up is simply on index licensing. Just thinking about what that run rate might be into 3Q, given you\u2019ve reached the threshold. I guess, when did you actually hit the threshold in the second quarter? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Okay. So I think we\u2019re going to answer the second question first just because it\u2019s a probably shorter answer. Go ahead, Ann.\nAnn Dennison: Sure, Brian. So on the index question, we hit the threshold in late April. And so you can think about the threshold affecting 2 out of the 3 months of the quarter.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And so on a run rate basis going forward, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s subject to the volumes in the futures markets. But I think that...\nAnn Dennison: Yes. All else held equal, they look third better than that particular part of the revenue. It will look a little better going into the fourth \u2013 third quarter.\nAdena Friedman: In terms of the bigger question that you asked regarding organic growth, I think that the first thing I would say is we really are pleased with the performance of the business, and we do have \u2013 we provide mission-critical software and analytics solutions to corporates, to other exchanges, to banks and brokers and to investment management firms. So we do feel that our solutions really do add value, particularly with these periods of volatility. It\u2019s really important for corporates to really understand how their investors are changing and how to engage with investors. And obviously, ESG is a growth \u2013 long-term growth trend for that. With our investment analytics, asset allocation decisions are super important, being able to manage our portfolio successfully as an asset owner is really important. And so those services are really sticky. Anti-fin crime, obviously, huge long-term trend in providing more advanced technology there. And then for market operators, you\u2019ve got mission-critical technology that drives our business. So we feel very good about the stickiness of our products as we\u2019re delivering them to clients. We have been investing across the franchise in terms of really delivering and improved and more modern technology solutions as we go. And I think all of that is accruing to our benefit in terms of the growth rate. But we also \u2013 there are a couple of things to think about in terms of their solutions segments. I think that, as we think about going forward, we have really strong growth in our listings business because we still have 9% more listed companies today than we had 1 year ago. Based on the IPO environment we\u2019re seeing today, that could be something that slows into 2023, that growth rate in our listings business. But the flip side of that is we now have 9% more companies. And as they roll off their IPO packages, we\u2019d like to make sure that we secure them as paying customers for our IR and ESG services. So that kind of gives us the ability to continue to grow there. And beyond that, I think you\u2019re right on the Market Infrastructure Technology side, Brian, that I do feel like we\u2019re really engaging really well with clients today. They are focused on the future of their markets. They are focused on how they bring some of this latest technology into their marketplaces. And the conversations are going from kind of theoretical to more concrete. And then on the back of that, we also, with everyone getting back together, we\u2019re able to identify new market or new markets that want to form, and we\u2019ve signed some really interesting and innovative markets in the quarter. So we do feel like that has a lot of momentum as we\u2019re going into the second half of this year and into 2023.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. So it sounds like some headwinds potentially. But really, you remain optimistic on this really strong growth \u2013 organic growth in Solutions segment.\nAdena Friedman: I mean, we \u2013 I would say, I\u2019m an external optimist, but I do remain optimistic that we\u2019re really \u2013 we are delivering really great value to the clients. And so we\u2019d like to continue that. I think we just know that there are always different dynamics we have to consider. And so therefore, we\u2019re maintaining our overall medium-term outlook to the 6% to 9%. But obviously, we have been performing better than that.\nBrian Bedell: Yes, fair enough. Thank you so much.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Alexander Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi, good morning, everybody. Hello.\nAdena Friedman: Hey, Alex.\nAnn Dennison: Hi, Alex.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So another one for you around the market structure regulation. Just to follow-up on Richard\u2019s question, I guess, around Chair Gensler\u2019s proposal. With respect to the, I guess, prior administration\u2019s proposal around market data, which was albeit it feels like a bit more narrow relative to what the current SEC Commission is trying to achieve, how are you expecting this to go forward from here given that it still feels like kind of in the background, but it\u2019s not clear where that fits in with the existing proposals?\nAdena Friedman: Well, sure. Well, I think the first thing we should note is we were pleased with the court decision in understanding the critical value of the exchanges in terms of overseeing the SIP plans and overseeing the consolidated tape. So, we are pleased with that. And I think infrastructure [ph] over consolidated data, which is a core part of the last \u2013 as you said, the last SEC rule proposal really means that the governance of that remains with the changes. But we also recognize we want to meet the needs of our clients. So, I think Alex, that there are lots of \u2013 there are a lot of components to that rule that was approved by the SEC. And I think that is slowly going to start to move forward now that the governance is kind of settled. But it will take some time because there were like multiple elements of that in terms of odd lots as well as the SIP data as well as multiple consolidators, and then they are like it\u2019s a phase-in over multiple years. So, I don\u2019t think we necessarily really fully understand the impact of that, but we also are engaging very much with the plans to figure out how we want to look at pricing. We have a pricing proposal with the SEC right now for them to consider. And we are also considering our role as a consolidator and the multiple consolidator model because that could be an opportunity for us. And so I think that it\u2019s going to be a slow-moving train, it is going to start to move forward now, though, so that we \u2013 I think because the governance structure is set, and we will just have to see how that goes over the next several years.\nAlexander Blostein: Got it. Great. Thanks very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: We have a question from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on market tech. And the margin there has moved around a lot. I wanted to see as you \u2013 or ask about whether you think you have seen the lows there and we can kind of consistently see margins kind of move higher. And then within that context, thinking about the normal seasonality of the legacy market tech business in terms of the fourth quarter with change orders and other things based on some of the dialogue you have been talking about with clients, should we assume some normalization of that in 2022?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I think I would say that, Daniel that we are starting to operate in a normal mode now in market tech, right. So, we are engaging with clients in person. We are co-locating client with clients in some cases. We are in a good place in terms of our delivery capabilities and we are servicing our clients well. And so I think that\u2019s all great. I think that in terms of the scalability of the business, we are signing \u2013 most of our new clients are signing SaaS-based contracts, which I think is very helpful in terms of \u2013 both in terms of the products they are buying, which are more standardized as opposed to specialized, but also in terms of how we can support them in a more scalable way over the long-term. But we still do have a lot of clients that are on-prem clients with very specialized solutions and we are still delivering those. So, it\u2019s a real mix at the moment. It\u2019s a true hybrid. And I think as a result of that, you do see some more variability in margins. You see more availability quarter-over-quarter in revenues, but we are kind of getting back to a normalized mode in terms of change request in terms of deliveries, in terms of new sales, and we are really encouraged by the SaaS orientation of the new sales. The one thing I would say about change request though is, as we move forward and signing more clients in a SaaS format, we are going to have lower change request revenues going forward, because it\u2019s less specialized, more standardized, but more stable and very sticky. And so I don\u2019t think we are going to see an immediate change there, but I just would say for the longer term, we would expect that to kind of moderate a bit in favor of more sticky and stable revenue coming from SaaS.\nDaniel Fannon: Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Good morning.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, my question is on cash equities. A major competitor increased the pricing of trades in the opening, closing auctions this past quarter. And Nasdaq has high market share for these trades. Wondering if Nasdaq also has the ability to raise pricing?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I think that we have been \u2013 we have had very stable pricing in our auctions for a long time. I think there were some changes that our competitors did a couple of years ago in that space. We have been very, very stable there and I think that we continue to think we provide a very, very high value in the opening and closing auctions. We think we are paid for that value. And I think our clients appreciate the execution quality they get. So, we see that more as a steady as we go because of the fact that we provide a great service, and we do feel like that we are rewarded for that. Obviously, we are really excited about what happened with the Russell, because that was a \u2013 that\u2019s a big event, and then you have the quarterly \u2013 the quad witches, you have other rebalances. Those are big events for us. We invest a lot in our infrastructure to support those events. Those are really \u2013 those are surge moments and we feel great about our ability to execute in those moments. But that\u2019s \u2013 we invest a lot to make that happen. And I think therefore, we are paid appropriately for that. But that\u2019s kind of how we are looking at it right now.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could speak a bit about M&A. you have de-levered quite a bit to 2.7x net debt to EBITDA. Can you remind us where you feel comfortable taking leverage to on a net basis given the current business mix and assuming you find an attractive acquisition opportunity? And then just regarding the M&A environment. Over the past few years, you have been looking at very attractive assets in terms of secular growth rates or medium-term growth rates and improving the growth profile of Nasdaq as a whole. I guess in the public markets we have seen valuations come in quite a bit for some of the higher growth assets. Have you started to see that in the private markets and has based in the bid-ask spread kind of narrowed as we are looking at the environment today versus maybe where we were at a year ago?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I mean Ann, do you want to answer the first part of the question in terms of\u2026\nAnn Dennison: Yes. I will answer the question around sort of where we would take the leverage ratios. There is a lot of dependencies there, Kyle, in terms of what is the M&A opportunity, how quickly we could de-lever. I think maybe the best point of reference is what we did at the Verafin deal, where we took the leverage up to 3.9 and on a gross basis. And then we are back down to 2.9 now. And so you could think about it that way. We don\u2019t have a \u2013 like there is no hard and set rule. It\u2019s very circumstance based. And obviously, we would be working with the rating agencies on our \u2013 on whatever our deleveraging plan would be in association with that, so.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I mean I think the one thing we do say is that we do like our investment grade rating. And so we would work with the rating agencies to understand, looking at deals and making sure that we factor in our investment grade rating as we are looking at and financing deals. So, that\u2019s how we generally look at it. In terms of the M&A environment, it is definitely a changing environment right now. I also think it takes time for companies to recognize what \u2013 in a changing market cap environment, it takes time for companies to think \u2013 to understand what their true value is over time. Like is the market going to recover and they feel that they are going to be able to grow their way into their market cap very quickly or their old market cap very quickly, or are they understanding that this might be just a different longer term environment. And I think that definitely factors into receptivity to M&A, both in the private markets and the public markets. We are definitely seeing in the private markets, generally speaking, reductions in valuations, but that\u2019s kind of in line with the public markets or maybe not quite so much, not quite as dramatic. And \u2013 but again, that\u2019s one thing to have that as a point in time reference for a CEO. It\u2019s another thing to think that that\u2019s the value that they should sell their company at. So, I still think it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. But I think, Kyle, we are always evaluating opportunistic ways for us to continue to drive our strategy forward. But we are really focused on organic growth. I mean that is the vast majority of our focus inside of Nasdaq, is how we want to continue to sustain our organic growth with us also looking at M&A, like small deals like Metrio and other things that we might do is small to medium bolt-ons as we continue to grow out our business.\nKyle Voigt: Very helpful. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Just a question on ESG. I was hoping you might be able to remind us how much that contributes in revenue today given some of the acquisitions that you have done. And when you look at the offerings that you have on the ESG side, which product services or on ESG, do you think would be the most meaningful to growth in ESG revenues at Nasdaq? And as you think about the offerings that you have on that side, how does that stack up relative to where you would like to be in the marketplace with respect to ESG? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So, I think that if we \u2013 we don\u2019t disclose our ESG revenues separately from the rest of our corporate services revenues. But I would say that it is definitely the highest growth part of the business and it is helping drive to the higher growth rates we are seeing in IR and ESG right now. As we have given out some thoughts at the last Investor Day as to what we hope to achieve in terms of revenues between now and 2024 or \u201825. And we definitely feel that we are at least on track with that. And so \u2013 and we continue to invest there. And so as we get into our Investor Day this year, we will hopefully be able to give you a little bit more content and color around that so that we can continue to help you understand how much of a business that\u2019s becoming for us, and we are quite excited about it. But I would point out that there are kind of \u2013 there are several components to it. But within the corporate space, right now, the advisory business is actually the highest demand part of the business. But more and more, it\u2019s moving into reporting. So, at first, the companies were saying, 5 years ago, they were saying, what is the SMG and how do I communicate with investors around it. We help them think about their programs, mature their programs. We now have kind of annual contracts with clients to help them manage those programs in terms of communicating appropriately with investors. Increasingly, though, we are seeing more and more companies on-boarding onto OneReport and now Metrio for collecting data and reporting that data out to the rating agencies. And that\u2019s going to be the long-term growth driver for us. Definitely, as companies are maturing their programs, it\u2019s going to be the tools that we provide to them that really help them mature those programs and sustain them. And then the other part of the business that we don\u2019t talk about a lot because it is very, very small, like really small. But within our European markets business, we do have a carbon removal marketplace called Puro. It\u2019s very early days. But that even though it\u2019s \u2013 I would say just say it\u2019s like $2 million in revenue today, it\u2019s really small. It is growing very quickly in terms of getting more suppliers into the platform and getting corporates more and more opportunities to offset their carbon output with true high-quality carbon removal. And we see that as kind of a 10-year \u2013 5-year, 10-year plan to really build out a really successful marketplace there. And so that will also be a long-term growth driver for us. But today, these are relatively small, but exciting and growing areas, and we will give \u2013 we will be able to give you more content at Investor Day.\nMichael Cyprys: Alright. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nGautam Sawant: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Can you provide your outlook on growth of recurring and SaaS revenues could be affected by our recession within 2023, specifically how the potential for industry consolidation could affect investment intelligence?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. I mean I think that we obviously don\u2019t provide specific guidance in any of our businesses. But I would say in our SaaS businesses, the general \u2013 what we have seen so far is that we have not seen any material changes in buying behaviors across our SaaS-oriented businesses, and that includes investment analytics, our IR and ESG services, our anti-financial crime solutions and some of the newer sales in our market tech business. And so I think that we really don\u2019t see any sort of significant changes in behaviors there. But as we go into a recessionary environment and that\u2019s hard to predict right now, but if we were to go into that and have that a sustained economic environment that we are navigating through in 2023, I think that we would still look at the following. It is our products are very sticky because of the fact they provide such important services to clients to navigate the capital markets in every environment. In some cases, they are technology that are the capital markets. And so we do think they are very sticky. I think in terms of buying decisions in a protracted recessionary environment, some of those buying decisions will take longer. We could have companies, as you talked about, that could have some M&A and have some on the edges, some changes in their corporate status, and that will obviously have some effect on retention. But again, we are talking very high retention products, very, very important products, very sticky products. In terms of M&A, though, in the financial industry, generally, if we look back over prior recessionary periods, you don\u2019t actually see a lot of M&A among banks and among asset managers as a general matter. On the edges, yes, but we are talking \u2013 we have 3,000 banks and we have 3,000 asset managers that use our services. So, it\u2019s just not going to be a material part of the calculus in terms of our services just based on the breadth and depth of the companies we support. And also, by the way, I think it\u2019s 10,000 corporate clients that use our IR and ESG services. So, we \u2013 just by the scale of who we are, the M&A is not going to be a huge factor. But we will certainly provide you updates if we are seeing changes there.\nGautam Sawant: Got it. And just as a follow-up question on compensation, like has the demand or worker talent in the technology space change? And do you think that can help decelerate some of the expense there a bit?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I think that it\u2019s interesting. Certainly, we have been doing the right things to make sure that we attract and retain great talent. And I feel very good about how we\u2019ve been managing our compensation in this competitive environment. We have, I would say, in the last six weeks to eight weeks, started to see more people really wanting to come to Nasdaq, frankly. We are a really strong company and we have a strong financial profile. And I think that some people who left the company are coming back, employees that are in some of the more hard hit parts of the technology industry are understanding the benefits of working in a place like Nasdaq. And so I don\u2019t know yet, Gautam, how much that might impact comp, but I would say that we feel good about our ability to attract great talent here.\nGautam Sawant: Thank you for taking my questions.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you please give us more color on your migration into the cloud. And I think Adena, you mentioned the first migration will be completed in the fourth quarter this year. Could you please talk about what have you learned so far in this process? And how does that impact your process to migrate other systems in the future? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Hey Owen. Yes. So, we are actually quite excited about the progress we are making with AWS. So, just to remind everyone, AWS is committed to create private local zone within the Carteret data center, which is our primary data center in New Jersey, to support our markets in a cloud environment. But recognize, okay, so if we just take one step back, over the last 10 years, we have really been focused on moving all of what we call our surrounding systems into a public cloud environment. So, our market operation systems and some of the client-facing systems that we have to support trading. But the trading systems themselves, the matching engine itself, has always been on-premise deployment. So, AWS is coming into our data center. We are moving our first options market into the AWS Outpost infrastructure. Our plan is to do that in the fourth quarter. We are on track with that. What we have been learning is really helping us making sure we are optimizing for power in the context of bringing the AWS infrastructure into the data center, while we build out the data center. So, over the next 2 years, we are going to be expanding the data center in connection with Equinix, that\u2019s our partner who really is working on that, and that will also extend our power. As we work with AWS in the first iterations of putting out post in and getting them up and running, we are just making sure we are managing to the power of that infrastructure in connection with, obviously, the power needs of all of our clients. And so that\u2019s the one thing that we are finding it\u2019s really interesting to learn through. But at the same time, we are very comfortable that we are moving now. We have moved MRX onto Fusion. We have tested that in an on-prem environment with our clients as a baseline and we now get to the \u2013 therefore, start testing with our clients in the fall in the new environment and to make sure that we are delivering the same performance. So, we are well underway and we are learning a lot and it\u2019s been a great partnership, and we feel very good about it.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And that\u2019s all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Well, thank you very much, and it\u2019s really, thank you so much for spending time with us. We continue to be excited and proud of the results we have delivered, and we will continue to update you on our progress as we heard, and we will continue to update you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter 2022 financial and business performance as well as the progress we have made to drive forward our strategic priorities for the year. I'd like to begin by acknowledging that we continue to find ourselves amid an uncertain macroeconomic and geopolitical environment. Yet while markets, investors and corporate clients all experienced increased levels of volatility during the second quarter, Nasdaq's strategic vision and our ability to execute on it remains clear. The strength and quality of our businesses puts us in an excellent position to navigate these dynamics. Our record net revenue and non-GAAP EPS results demonstrate our ability to capture new opportunities in different operating environments even as we continue to strengthen our positioning for longer-term growth through focused investments. I am proud of our team's focus on delivering consistent results to our clients against this dynamic backdrop. Let's turn to our results. I am very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the second quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $893 million in net revenues, a 6% increase compared to the prior year period and 9% on an organic basis, excluding the impacts and changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.97 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled \u2013 sorry, $679 million in the second quarter of 2022, growing at an even faster rate of 12%, which reflects strong demand for our anti-financial crime solutions and investment analytics offerings. SaaS revenue now comprises 35% of total company ARR, a new high. The consistent growth we are seeing in our recurring revenue segments provides a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across with our index licensing and trading revenues. Turning next to specific highlights from our business segments, our Solutions segment delivered combined total revenue of $582 million during the second quarter, a 10% increase from the prior year period or 12%, excluding the impact of FX. The growth was driven from activity across several of our businesses, including our index and analytics offerings, the expansion of our listed issuer base, our anti-financial crime offerings, as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $283 million in total revenue in the second quarter, an 8% overall increase from the prior year period and 10%, excluding the impact of FX with growth contributions from across the businesses during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business increased by 1% from the prior year period and 3% excluding the impact of FX, primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from international clients. In our index business, we saw revenue growth of $17 million or 16% versus the prior year period, driven by positive net flows of $71 billion over the last 12 months, including $25 billion of inflows during the especially challenging beta environment experienced in the first half of 2022. We also saw especially strong results from license features activities, which together with inflows, more than offset the negative impact of market beta. And in our analytics business, revenues grew 8% from the prior year period and 10% excluding the impact of FX. Our flagship eVestment analytics offerings saw continued strong user adoption, both across our asset owners and asset managers and drove annualized SaaS revenues for the Investment Intelligence segment to increase 12% versus the prior year period to $215 million. Turning next to our Market Technology segment, we delivered $131 million in total revenues in the second quarter, a 12% increase from the prior year period. This was primarily driven by continued growth in our broader anti-financial crime technology solutions business. Our anti-financial crime technology business had a strong second quarter with a 29% increase in revenues versus the prior year period. Growth was driven by sales in our fraud and anti-money laundering, or what we call FRAML solutions, as well as the impact of the Verafin acquisition deferred revenue adjustment recorded in the second \u2013 in the prior year period. We welcomed 37 new clients during the quarter. We continue to gain momentum with our efforts to expand Verafin's presence with larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks through our proof-of-concept trials. These are active evaluations within our prospective client's compliance infrastructures. While this diligence process results in a relatively long technology purchasing cycle, it is an important step to drive our success in extending our solutions to this area of the market. Moving next to our Market Infrastructure Technology business, we generated $56 million in net revenues during the second quarter. Importantly, we made continued progress on the deliverables within a group of particularly large client projects that we have discussed in recent quarters, reflecting our increased ability to work with clients on site. Specifically, we completed Phase 1 deliveries for all four of our largest implementations by the end of the quarter. While some of the projects have follow-on phases, we are pleased to have met these important milestones so far this year. Market Infrastructure Technology also had some exciting new relationships that were announced during the period. In May, SP, a provider of financial products and services in Brazil, announced the development of their new trading platform for digital assets, which is leveraging Nasdaq's next-gen technology deployed as a SaaS solution in the cloud. In June, Climate Impact X, a Singapore-based marketplace for carbon credits, announced their decision to leverage Nasdaq's SaaS-based marketplace services platform to power their new spot exchange for carbon credits, which is slated for launch in early 2023. As I noted earlier, we are actively engaging in person with our clients again and the team recently welcomed over 100 officials from 50 global marketplaces to our Annual Technology of the Future Industry Conference. The overall sentiment from clients there was incredibly encouraging, particularly as the market infrastructure operators see the advantages that our technology, including our cloud deployed solutions, can bring to their respective customers as they contemplate shifts in their operating models and look for new ways to differentiate their offerings. We remain confident in our ability to improve our organic growth through the remainder of 2022 and into 2023. Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses, our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $310 million during the second quarter. We maximized opportunities presented by robust levels of activity through strong market share and consistent pricing strategies. The share volume traded on Nasdaq Exchanges grew by 22% compared to the prior year quarter. And trade management services revenues hit a new quarterly high of $87 million, up 7% versus the prior year, reflecting an increase in demand for connectivity and infrastructure services. At the end of June, Nasdaq's Closing Cross set a record for the number of shares traded during the 2022 Russell U.S. Indexes Reconstitution, 3.3 billion shares, representing nearly $64 billion were executed in two seconds across Nasdaq-listed securities, a 40% increase in shares crossed from last year's event. I am incredibly proud of our market services team on achieving yet this important milestone. The new Closing Cross record is a testament to the investments we have made in our technology and a result of the trust the team has worked diligently to build with all investors, including through some of the most volatile market periods on record. Nasdaq's Nordic equities markets also saw strong volumes as well. The value of our shares traded on Nasdaq's Nordic and Baltic markets for the first half of 2022 was the second highest since 2008. Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered revenue of $168 million in the second quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our expanded listed issuer bases across both our U.S. and Nordic listing franchises as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services. Revenues in our IR and ESG services business increased 9%, underscoring the strong demand for our consultative and technology-based solutions during the period. The number of corporate clients using Nasdaq's IR and ESG services solutions increased 6% from the prior year period, while you have also been expanding relationships of existing clients. In addition, during the second quarter, we acquired Metrio, a provider of corporate sustainability data analytics and reporting services to corporates. Metrio's SaaS-based platform is complementary to our existing suite of IR \u2013 I am sorry, of ESG reporting solutions and will accelerate our ability to support corporate clients and their expanding sustainability management and reporting needs. Our growing expertise in all components of E S and G enable us to help our corporate clients confidently navigate the complexity of the modern capital markets, including managing their investor relationships more successfully. Turning to our Listing Services business. Revenue increased 15% to $107 million as the number of Nasdaq-listed corporate issuers, excluding SPACs, increased 9% compared to the prior year period. Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting the majority of new U.S. listings for the 34th consecutive quarter, with 38 IPOs raising a combined $2.8 billion for an 88% win rate. In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges also welcomed 25 new listings. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our second quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's client-centric culture and diversified business model provides us the stability to perform well in different market environments. As we enter the second half of 2022, we continue to focus on broadening opportunities within three major areas that align with our strategic evolution. First, under the pillar of liquidity, we are a leader in the modernization of marketplaces through our world class technology. This includes the progress we are making as we migrate our own markets to a cloud-enabled state, including the planned migration of our MRX Options market in the fourth quarter of this year as well as our efforts to enable more of our market infrastructure technology clients to maximize cloud and other powerful technologies within their offerings. Second, under the pillar of transparency, we believe that we are incredibly well positioned to execute on our unique and substantial opportunity to be a leading ESG solutions provider. We are centered first on a foundation of serving the specific needs of corporate clients by providing advisory services along with SaaS-based data aggregation and reporting capabilities to facilitate their ability to communicate their ESG and climate strategies and progress to the investment community. And third, under the pillar of integrity, we play an important role in seeking to make the entire financial system more safe and fair for savers and investors through our powerful and diverse anti-financial crime offerings combined with our network of bank and brokerage clients. We remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy and we believe that Nasdaq is well-positioned to navigate the geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward into the latter half of this year. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details. Yes, sure. Rich, it's great to hear from you. And I would say that with regard to the market structure discussions and proposals that we're seeing, first of all, we have a long way to go because we haven't yet actually seen formal proposals. But as we're listening to Chair Gensler and understanding where he's focused, I think that we're, first and foremost, pleased that he does really recognize the value of exchanges and competition in lit markets. He's really focused on strengthening the National Best Bid offer so that investors have a really solid understanding of true supply and demand in the market at all times. And he's really focused in on transparency in terms of transparency around best execution, disclosure of execution quality, and really focusing on how to bring more orders into the lit venues because, and that's also focused on leveling the playing field from a competitive perspective between exchanges and dark pools. So overall, we see what he's trying to achieve, we think is beneficial to investors. I think as we look at some of the incentive structures that he's focused on, obviously, we see great value in the rebate structure that we have on exchanges because it really incentivizes participants to put their quotes into a lit venue and make those quotes available on the national \u2013 as part of the National Best Bid offer, so the incentive structure is really literally designed to support lit quotes and lit orders. But I think that generally speaking, we still have a long way to go to understand what all the proposals will be. And then, of course, that then starts a long process around the comments in the industry engagements to determine what a final proposal would look like. So it's just the beginning, but we are encouraged by a lot of the areas that he's focused on. Yes. And I think it's also just really important to note that in the last eight consecutive quarters, we've had double-digit growth in our Solutions segment. So we thought have been exceeding the overall medium-term outlook that we've been providing in those segments, which then, of course, really makes us make sure that we have the right personnel and the right team to be able to support that growth, not only in terms of having all these new clients that we're now servicing from the growth that we've experienced, but also continue to make investments in the businesses to continue to drive the growth that they are hoping to achieve. So all of that is reflected in the guidance and in addition to, obviously, the performance we've shown so far. Sure. Sure. Yes. Thanks, Alex. So we do provide the numbers now on that \u2013 the basis of that sub-segment, which is anti-fin crime. But if I give some color around on the two components, so there is two components to the anti-fin crime business today. One is the Verafin business, which is the Fraud and AML detection and investigation technology; and the other is our market surveillance and trade surveillance business. And both of them continue to have healthy growth and healthy engagement with clients. I think that as we look at that business, just like we do with Market Tech, we look at it over a 12-month period, not so much quarter by quarter. But it is also probably worth noting that in the second quarter of last year, Verafin had a truly outsized growth quarter. And so we're trying \u2013 we're looking at that in the context of the current quarter in the context of that very outsized quarter last Q2. I think in general, as you mentioned, we are seeing continued strong growth across Verafin. We expect Verafin to continue throughout the year to perform along the lines of where we \u2013 what we've been discussing with all of our investors since we bought Verafin. And we also are seeing really good engagement with the Tier 1 banks to try to deliver those services up market. I think the one thing about that is that the sales cycles with those Tier 1 banks are long. And we know that. I mean we obviously serve Tier 1s with our surveillance solutions. Just getting through the contracting process can take time. And that can create a little bit more variability quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate there. But we see really strong performance around the SME banks, the smaller banks, the midsized banks, fin-techs and now really engaging more and more with the Tier 1 banks. With regard to the trade surveillance and market surveillance business, trade surveillance continues to have really great engagement in terms of renewing contracts, expanding contracts. We now have a crypto trading module that we're \u2013 we have \u2013 we signed our first client around. And we also \u2013 we're continuing to invest in that business. I think the market surveillance part of that business is a little bit of slower growth business, and it always has been, always will be at a smaller client set. And there, we had, I would say, more of a kind of a flat quarter \u2013 year-over-year quarter experience. So I think all of that adds up, Alex, to what you saw. And I think that we \u2013 but we continue to see great momentum in the business. Yes, no. It's \u2013 well, it's a combination of things. So I'm going to try to answer some of it. I'm going to hand it to Ann to make sure I give you a complete answer. But I think the first thing is investment continues to have good growth. They continue to sign new clients and continue to grow and expand what they are doing. And that shows up incrementally every quarter sequentially. Obviously, there are going to be some quarters that are stronger than others just in terms of sales and expansions of our contracts. I think, though, that what you've got a couple of dynamics under the surface that one is just we have now some revenue associated with running programs around secondary transactions for private equity funds, and that showed up in the first quarter. And then I think there was something else in the fourth quarter. Was it FX or... Yes, great. Thanks, Alex. Sure. Okay. So I think we're going to answer the second question first just because it's a probably shorter answer. Go ahead, Ann. Yes. And so on a run rate basis going forward, I mean, obviously, it's subject to the volumes in the futures markets. But I think that... In terms of the bigger question that you asked regarding organic growth, I think that the first thing I would say is we really are pleased with the performance of the business, and we do have \u2013 we provide mission-critical software and analytics solutions to corporates, to other exchanges, to banks and brokers and to investment management firms. So we do feel that our solutions really do add value, particularly with these periods of volatility. It's really important for corporates to really understand how their investors are changing and how to engage with investors. And obviously, ESG is a growth \u2013 long-term growth trend for that. With our investment analytics, asset allocation decisions are super important, being able to manage our portfolio successfully as an asset owner is really important. And so those services are really sticky. Anti-fin crime, obviously, huge long-term trend in providing more advanced technology there. And then for market operators, you've got mission-critical technology that drives our business. So we feel very good about the stickiness of our products as we're delivering them to clients. We have been investing across the franchise in terms of really delivering and improved and more modern technology solutions as we go. And I think all of that is accruing to our benefit in terms of the growth rate. But we also \u2013 there are a couple of things to think about in terms of their solutions segments. I think that, as we think about going forward, we have really strong growth in our listings business because we still have 9% more listed companies today than we had 1 year ago. Based on the IPO environment we're seeing today, that could be something that slows into 2023, that growth rate in our listings business. But the flip side of that is we now have 9% more companies. And as they roll off their IPO packages, we'd like to make sure that we secure them as paying customers for our IR and ESG services. So that kind of gives us the ability to continue to grow there. And beyond that, I think you're right on the Market Infrastructure Technology side, Brian, that I do feel like we're really engaging really well with clients today. They are focused on the future of their markets. They are focused on how they bring some of this latest technology into their marketplaces. And the conversations are going from kind of theoretical to more concrete. And then on the back of that, we also, with everyone getting back together, we're able to identify new market or new markets that want to form, and we've signed some really interesting and innovative markets in the quarter. So we do feel like that has a lot of momentum as we're going into the second half of this year and into 2023. I mean, we \u2013 I would say, I'm an external optimist, but I do remain optimistic that we're really \u2013 we are delivering really great value to the clients. And so we'd like to continue that. I think we just know that there are always different dynamics we have to consider. And so therefore, we're maintaining our overall medium-term outlook to the 6% to 9%. But obviously, we have been performing better than that. Thanks. Hey, Alex. Well, sure. Well, I think the first thing we should note is we were pleased with the court decision in understanding the critical value of the exchanges in terms of overseeing the SIP plans and overseeing the consolidated tape. So, we are pleased with that. And I think infrastructure [ph] over consolidated data, which is a core part of the last \u2013 as you said, the last SEC rule proposal really means that the governance of that remains with the changes. But we also recognize we want to meet the needs of our clients. So, I think Alex, that there are lots of \u2013 there are a lot of components to that rule that was approved by the SEC. And I think that is slowly going to start to move forward now that the governance is kind of settled. But it will take some time because there were like multiple elements of that in terms of odd lots as well as the SIP data as well as multiple consolidators, and then they are like it's a phase-in over multiple years. So, I don't think we necessarily really fully understand the impact of that, but we also are engaging very much with the plans to figure out how we want to look at pricing. We have a pricing proposal with the SEC right now for them to consider. And we are also considering our role as a consolidator and the multiple consolidator model because that could be an opportunity for us. And so I think that it's going to be a slow-moving train, it is going to start to move forward now, though, so that we \u2013 I think because the governance structure is set, and we will just have to see how that goes over the next several years. Sure. Sure. I think I would say that, Daniel that we are starting to operate in a normal mode now in market tech, right. So, we are engaging with clients in person. We are co-locating client with clients in some cases. We are in a good place in terms of our delivery capabilities and we are servicing our clients well. And so I think that's all great. I think that in terms of the scalability of the business, we are signing \u2013 most of our new clients are signing SaaS-based contracts, which I think is very helpful in terms of \u2013 both in terms of the products they are buying, which are more standardized as opposed to specialized, but also in terms of how we can support them in a more scalable way over the long-term. But we still do have a lot of clients that are on-prem clients with very specialized solutions and we are still delivering those. So, it's a real mix at the moment. It's a true hybrid. And I think as a result of that, you do see some more variability in margins. You see more availability quarter-over-quarter in revenues, but we are kind of getting back to a normalized mode in terms of change request in terms of deliveries, in terms of new sales, and we are really encouraged by the SaaS orientation of the new sales. The one thing I would say about change request though is, as we move forward and signing more clients in a SaaS format, we are going to have lower change request revenues going forward, because it's less specialized, more standardized, but more stable and very sticky. And so I don't think we are going to see an immediate change there, but I just would say for the longer term, we would expect that to kind of moderate a bit in favor of more sticky and stable revenue coming from SaaS. Sure. Good morning. Well, I think that we have been \u2013 we have had very stable pricing in our auctions for a long time. I think there were some changes that our competitors did a couple of years ago in that space. We have been very, very stable there and I think that we continue to think we provide a very, very high value in the opening and closing auctions. We think we are paid for that value. And I think our clients appreciate the execution quality they get. So, we see that more as a steady as we go because of the fact that we provide a great service, and we do feel like that we are rewarded for that. Obviously, we are really excited about what happened with the Russell, because that was a \u2013 that's a big event, and then you have the quarterly \u2013 the quad witches, you have other rebalances. Those are big events for us. We invest a lot in our infrastructure to support those events. Those are really \u2013 those are surge moments and we feel great about our ability to execute in those moments. But that's \u2013 we invest a lot to make that happen. And I think therefore, we are paid appropriately for that. But that's kind of how we are looking at it right now. Sure. I mean Ann, do you want to answer the first part of the question in terms of... Yes. And I mean I think the one thing we do say is that we do like our investment grade rating. And so we would work with the rating agencies to understand, looking at deals and making sure that we factor in our investment grade rating as we are looking at and financing deals. So, that's how we generally look at it. In terms of the M&A environment, it is definitely a changing environment right now. I also think it takes time for companies to recognize what \u2013 in a changing market cap environment, it takes time for companies to think \u2013 to understand what their true value is over time. Like is the market going to recover and they feel that they are going to be able to grow their way into their market cap very quickly or their old market cap very quickly, or are they understanding that this might be just a different longer term environment. And I think that definitely factors into receptivity to M&A, both in the private markets and the public markets. We are definitely seeing in the private markets, generally speaking, reductions in valuations, but that's kind of in line with the public markets or maybe not quite so much, not quite as dramatic. And \u2013 but again, that's one thing to have that as a point in time reference for a CEO. It's another thing to think that that's the value that they should sell their company at. So, I still think it's a very dynamic environment. But I think, Kyle, we are always evaluating opportunistic ways for us to continue to drive our strategy forward. But we are really focused on organic growth. I mean that is the vast majority of our focus inside of Nasdaq, is how we want to continue to sustain our organic growth with us also looking at M&A, like small deals like Metrio and other things that we might do is small to medium bolt-ons as we continue to grow out our business. Sure. Sure. So, I think that if we \u2013 we don't disclose our ESG revenues separately from the rest of our corporate services revenues. But I would say that it is definitely the highest growth part of the business and it is helping drive to the higher growth rates we are seeing in IR and ESG right now. As we have given out some thoughts at the last Investor Day as to what we hope to achieve in terms of revenues between now and 2024 or \u201825. And we definitely feel that we are at least on track with that. And so \u2013 and we continue to invest there. And so as we get into our Investor Day this year, we will hopefully be able to give you a little bit more content and color around that so that we can continue to help you understand how much of a business that's becoming for us, and we are quite excited about it. But I would point out that there are kind of \u2013 there are several components to it. But within the corporate space, right now, the advisory business is actually the highest demand part of the business. But more and more, it's moving into reporting. So, at first, the companies were saying, 5 years ago, they were saying, what is the SMG and how do I communicate with investors around it. We help them think about their programs, mature their programs. We now have kind of annual contracts with clients to help them manage those programs in terms of communicating appropriately with investors. Increasingly, though, we are seeing more and more companies on-boarding onto OneReport and now Metrio for collecting data and reporting that data out to the rating agencies. And that's going to be the long-term growth driver for us. Definitely, as companies are maturing their programs, it's going to be the tools that we provide to them that really help them mature those programs and sustain them. And then the other part of the business that we don't talk about a lot because it is very, very small, like really small. But within our European markets business, we do have a carbon removal marketplace called Puro. It's very early days. But that even though it's \u2013 I would say just say it's like $2 million in revenue today, it's really small. It is growing very quickly in terms of getting more suppliers into the platform and getting corporates more and more opportunities to offset their carbon output with true high-quality carbon removal. And we see that as kind of a 10-year \u2013 5-year, 10-year plan to really build out a really successful marketplace there. And so that will also be a long-term growth driver for us. But today, these are relatively small, but exciting and growing areas, and we will give \u2013 we will be able to give you more content at Investor Day. Sure. Sure. I mean I think that we obviously don't provide specific guidance in any of our businesses. But I would say in our SaaS businesses, the general \u2013 what we have seen so far is that we have not seen any material changes in buying behaviors across our SaaS-oriented businesses, and that includes investment analytics, our IR and ESG services, our anti-financial crime solutions and some of the newer sales in our market tech business. And so I think that we really don't see any sort of significant changes in behaviors there. But as we go into a recessionary environment and that's hard to predict right now, but if we were to go into that and have that a sustained economic environment that we are navigating through in 2023, I think that we would still look at the following. It is our products are very sticky because of the fact they provide such important services to clients to navigate the capital markets in every environment. In some cases, they are technology that are the capital markets. And so we do think they are very sticky. I think in terms of buying decisions in a protracted recessionary environment, some of those buying decisions will take longer. We could have companies, as you talked about, that could have some M&A and have some on the edges, some changes in their corporate status, and that will obviously have some effect on retention. But again, we are talking very high retention products, very, very important products, very sticky products. In terms of M&A, though, in the financial industry, generally, if we look back over prior recessionary periods, you don't actually see a lot of M&A among banks and among asset managers as a general matter. On the edges, yes, but we are talking \u2013 we have 3,000 banks and we have 3,000 asset managers that use our services. So, it's just not going to be a material part of the calculus in terms of our services just based on the breadth and depth of the companies we support. And also, by the way, I think it's 10,000 corporate clients that use our IR and ESG services. So, we \u2013 just by the scale of who we are, the M&A is not going to be a huge factor. But we will certainly provide you updates if we are seeing changes there. Yes. I think that it's interesting. Certainly, we have been doing the right things to make sure that we attract and retain great talent. And I feel very good about how we've been managing our compensation in this competitive environment. We have, I would say, in the last six weeks to eight weeks, started to see more people really wanting to come to Nasdaq, frankly. We are a really strong company and we have a strong financial profile. And I think that some people who left the company are coming back, employees that are in some of the more hard hit parts of the technology industry are understanding the benefits of working in a place like Nasdaq. And so I don't know yet, Gautam, how much that might impact comp, but I would say that we feel good about our ability to attract great talent here. Sure. Sure. Hey Owen. Yes. So, we are actually quite excited about the progress we are making with AWS. So, just to remind everyone, AWS is committed to create private local zone within the Carteret data center, which is our primary data center in New Jersey, to support our markets in a cloud environment. But recognize, okay, so if we just take one step back, over the last 10 years, we have really been focused on moving all of what we call our surrounding systems into a public cloud environment. So, our market operation systems and some of the client-facing systems that we have to support trading. But the trading systems themselves, the matching engine itself, has always been on-premise deployment. So, AWS is coming into our data center. We are moving our first options market into the AWS Outpost infrastructure. Our plan is to do that in the fourth quarter. We are on track with that. What we have been learning is really helping us making sure we are optimizing for power in the context of bringing the AWS infrastructure into the data center, while we build out the data center. So, over the next 2 years, we are going to be expanding the data center in connection with Equinix, that's our partner who really is working on that, and that will also extend our power. As we work with AWS in the first iterations of putting out post in and getting them up and running, we are just making sure we are managing to the power of that infrastructure in connection with, obviously, the power needs of all of our clients. And so that's the one thing that we are finding it's really interesting to learn through. But at the same time, we are very comfortable that we are moving now. We have moved MRX onto Fusion. We have tested that in an on-prem environment with our clients as a baseline and we now get to the \u2013 therefore, start testing with our clients in the fall in the new environment and to make sure that we are delivering the same performance. So, we are well underway and we are learning a lot and it's been a great partnership, and we feel very good about it. Sure. Well, thank you very much, and it's really, thank you so much for spending time with us. We continue to be excited and proud of the results we have delivered, and we will continue to update you on our progress as we heard, and we will continue to update you. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter 2022 performance, beginning on Slide 10 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $893 million is the net result of organic growth of 9%, including a 12% organic increase in the Solutions segment, and a 4% organic increase in Market Services partially offset by the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures and a 2% negative impact from changes in FX rates. Moving to operating profit and margins, non-GAAP operating income increased 6%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 54% was unchanged compared to the prior period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $342 million or $2.07 per diluted share compared to $316 million or $1.90 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 11, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.97 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $679 million, an increase of 12%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 12 through 15. Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $14 million or 12% with $10 million of the increase due to the impact of the deferred revenue write-down on Verafin in the prior year period. Organic growth for the Market Technology segment was 14% in the period and was driven by the anti-financial crime business, though market infrastructure technology saw a sequential improvement. ARR for Market Technology totaled $451 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 12% in the period. Investment Intelligence revenue increased $22 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $25 million or 10%. Organic revenue growth during the period reflects primarily strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as positive contribution from market data. ARR totaled $586 million, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year period. Our index revenues were up 16% compared to the prior year, due principally to higher revenues derived from Nasdaq licensed derivative products, where we saw the benefit of both higher trading volumes in the products as well as hitting the revenue threshold that triggers a step up in licensing economics, which happened about a month earlier in the year than we did in 2021. Based on the strength in the futures side of index licensing during the period, the percentage of index revenues from AUM-based licensing was 5 percentage points lower than the approximate two-thirds level we typically speak about. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 66% increased 1 percentage point from the prior year period. Corporate Platforms revenues increased $19 million or 13%, including 16% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations and ESG advisory and reporting offerings. Our listed corporate issuer base increased 11% or 9%, excluding SPAC. Corporate Platforms ARR was $586 million and increased 15% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platforms segment operating margin of 46% increased 4 percentage points compared to the prior year period, driven by a combination of recent growth in the listed issuer base and lower marketing expense due to the subdued IPO environment. Market Services net revenues increased $2 million or 1%. The organic revenue increase was $11 million or 4% and there was $9 million negative impact from changes in FX rates. The organic increase reflects growth in trade management services, equity derivatives and cash equity revenues. The segment operating margin of 65% was unchanged from the prior year period. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance, non-GAAP operating expenses increased $21 million to $413 million. The increase reflects a $42 million organic increase partially offset by a $17 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates and a $4 million decrease from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting two factors. First is our continued investment in new employees to drive growth, including a 9% increase in the team over the past 12 months. Second is annual merit increases, which is reflected in the quarterly expense run-rate starting in the second quarter. The merit increase was higher than prior years due to inflationary pressures on compensation and we have built the higher increase into our guidance at the beginning of the year. We continue to make significant investments in this tightened labor market to attract and retain the top talent in our industry. We are narrowing our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.71 billion to $1.74 billion, tightening both the top and bottom of the prior range to account for expectations of continued investments, current FX rates and the continued strong performance thus far in 2022. Turning to Slide 17, debt decreased by $182 million versus 1Q \u201822, primarily due to our repayment of the $499 million \u2013 repayment of $499 million of the 4.25% senior unsecured notes due June 2024, partially offset by a net issuance of $421 million of commercial paper and a $105 million decrease in Eurobond's book values caused by a weaker euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.9x, down from 3.1x in the first quarter of 2022. Let me take a moment now to update you on the dividend, stock repurchases and our Board approval to split our stock. During the second quarter of 2022, the company repurchased $166 million in shares and paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million. We have successfully completed the share repurchase program to offset dilution related to the divestiture of our U.S. fixed income business in June of 2021. As of June 30, 2022, there was $293 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. I am also pleased to announce that our Board approved and declared a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. As we had previously disclosed, the approval of an amendment to our charter to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock to permit us to effect the stock dividend required the approval of both the SEC and our shareholders. We received both approvals last month and filed the charter amendment yesterday. The record date for the stock dividend will be August 12, with a distribution date of August 26, and we expect trading to begin on a split-adjusted basis on August 29. Turning to Page 18 of the presentation, I'd like to touch on some of the very material progress we've made executing on our sustainability strategy. First, in terms of external impact. As Adena mentioned, we announced and closed on the Metrio acquisition in June, expanding our corporate serving ESG solution set, which will complement the more framework-based approach of our existing OneReport solution. Second, in terms of corporate sustainability, we published our annual sustainability and TCFD reports in June. On advancing our climate strategy, we have had our 2021 GHG emissions verified by a third party and submitted our science-based targets to the Science-based Targets Initiative for official validation. Lastly, in July, we received a two-level upgrade of our MSCI ESG rating to AA, recognizing the overall strength of our sustainability profile including our leading governance standards in particular. We continue to see opportunities to advance our sustainability program across multiple aspects and look forward to updating you on our progress regularly. In closing, Nasdaq's second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 12% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 54% non-GAAP operating margin, resulting in what we see as strong momentum thus far in 2022 that we can build upon moving forward. Thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure, Rich. So just back to sort of how we think about expenses in the context of revenue growth, we align our medium-term outlook for our Solutions segment revenues is 6% to 9%. And then against that, we think about a 3% to 6% expense growth. Coming into the year, we did \u2013 we talked about and built into our guidance an additional 2% to reflect inflationary factors as well as the cost of return to office and travel, et cetera. And so that's all built into the guidance. There is some variability in the way that things come in throughout the year. And so when you look at the second quarter, there is a couple of things, FX, taking that down and just variability and the timing of accruals. And so as we look forward to the back half of the year, we'd expect to come in depending on performance, either at the midpoint or towards the top end of our expense guidance range. And just like in past years, we'd expect an increase in 3Q and that to be even higher in 4Q, where we have some seasonality in expenses. It's not FX. We have a couple of other small non-recurring items that tipped over the rounding. So there is a little bit of noise behind it. But the core of the analytics business, the asset owner solutions are growing as expected. Sure, Brian. So on the index question, we hit the threshold in late April. And so you can think about the threshold affecting 2 out of the 3 months of the quarter. Yes. All else held equal, they look third better than that particular part of the revenue. It will look a little better going into the fourth \u2013 third quarter. Hi, Alex. Yes. I will answer the question around sort of where we would take the leverage ratios. There is a lot of dependencies there, Kyle, in terms of what is the M&A opportunity, how quickly we could de-lever. I think maybe the best point of reference is what we did at the Verafin deal, where we took the leverage up to 3.9 and on a gross basis. And then we are back down to 2.9 now. And so you could think about it that way. We don't have a \u2013 like there is no hard and set rule. It's very circumstance based. And obviously, we would be working with the rating agencies on our \u2013 on whatever our deleveraging plan would be in association with that, so."

After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Ed Ditmire, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nEdward Ditmire: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2022 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our CEO; Ann Dennison, our CFO; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we'll open up the line to Q&A. . The press release and presentation are on our website, and we intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC regulation update. I'd like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and as such, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections, and information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC.  I'll now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin my remarks today by addressing the current market landscape.  As I've noted in past calls, the Nasdaq team has become familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be. The first quarter of 2022 was certainly no different, given the dynamic geopolitical and economic factors we experienced during the period. As I've noted in prior public comments, the war in Ukraine is a terrible tragedy, and we stand with the greater business community urgently calling for peace. Nasdaq has a proud and long-standing position in Europe, which includes 7 markets we operate across the Nordic and Baltic countries, specifically Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden. We've been extremely diligent in monitoring the threat environment in Europe and across our global operations to protect our employees and to ensure the resiliency of our markets and client solutions.  Our revenue exposure to Russian clients was de minimis, and we remain committed to ensuring full compliance with all relevant sanctions. In addition, our global workforce is highly engaged in humanitarian and philanthropic efforts to support the needs of those impacted by the senseless war. It fills me with immense pride to see the outpouring of support across our employee base.  Regarding the backdrop we are operating against, our corporate clients and our investor clients are navigating through a very dynamic environment, where strong economic growth has been accompanied with significant inflation, continued supply chain and labor shortage challenges and increasing geopolitical impacts. This environment creates volatility in markets, which tends to be a volume driver, and we have continued to experience strong volumes across our U.S. and European markets. It also creates an uncertain landscape for investors to navigate, resulting in a slowdown in capital raising activities, including IPOs.  And depending on the way the markets are moving, it creates interesting dynamics for our index business. This quarter, the drop in market cap was offset partially by inflows into our index products and strong index futures volumes.  Looking beyond the direct market impacts, because we offer solutions that help our clients navigate through these uncertain times, it's actually increased our client engagement in 3 key areas where we have secular growth. Our bank clients are managing increasingly complex geopolitical risks, which results in strong demand for advanced anti-financial crime solutions, which we offer with Verafin.  Asset owners, including pensions, sovereign wealth funds and endowments, are making quick asset allocation changes and must manage their portfolios very carefully, which increases their reliance on our eVestment and Solovis offerings. On the corporate side, our clients are navigating through a dynamic ESG environment, which drives demand for our ESG advisory and reporting solutions.  Overall, our diversified business model gives us the means to be able to manage successfully in this environment recognizing, of course, that there are a lot of different forces at play. And in that context, let me briefly address the inflation-related pressures, which are certainly factors we are navigating as is the broader corporate community.  On the revenue side, we are fortunate to benefit from a highly diversified revenue mix based on providing mission-critical solutions that support our clients and the broader financial system around the world. We take a long-term approach to value creation for our shareholders in the context of serving our clients, and we will continue to manage that balance thoughtfully.  In addition, we are actively managing the evolution of inflationary pressures across our expense base. Our current expense guidance reflects the near-term actions we have taken to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining a highly skilled team in today's economy, and we'll continue to monitor the situation over time.  Our team's focus on secular opportunities to drive organic growth as well as our business model's reliance on recurring revenue components has enabled Nasdaq to continue our track record of growth as we execute against our longer-term objectives. The record net revenue we achieved in the quarter against this very dynamic backdrop illustrates the strength of Nasdaq's business model.  Next, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank 2 of our senior leaders for their years of impactful contributions to Nasdaq following the announcements that they will be moving on to new chapters in their lives. First, I want to congratulate Lars Ottersgard for his 16 years of leading our Market Technology business. During his tenure, he led a dramatic expansion in the capabilities and client network for the business and helped advance our ongoing transition to a more scalable SaaS-focused orientation.  I also want to thank Lauren Dillard, who in her 3 years at Nasdaq delivered tremendous impact in strategically repositioning the Investment Intelligence business that now features a majority of revenue contribution from higher growth index and analytics products. We're incredibly excited about the strong successors we announced during the quarter for the market technology and Investment and Intelligence segments.  Specifically, Jamie King, who joined us from Verafin, will lead the anti-financial crime technology business. Roland Chai, who joined in Nasdaq in 2020, will lead the market infrastructure technology business. Those 2 businesses will continue to roll out to form the Market Technology segment. Oliver Albers, a long-standing Nasdaq executive will lead our Investment Intelligence segment. All 3 are respected leaders in their fields with deep industry expertise and a proven track record of success. Let's now turn to our results.  I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $892 million in net revenues, a 5% increase compared to what was itself a very strong prior year period when the company previously set a quarterly record on trading revenues. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.91 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing 34% of our total company ARR, reflecting particularly strong growth in our anti-financial crime and investment analytics businesses.  Our recurring revenues and their consistent growth provide a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across both index licensing and trading revenues. This solid start to the year positions us well to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.  Turning next to specific highlights from our business segments. Our Solutions segment businesses delivered combined total revenue of $576 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven from several of our businesses, including our anti-financial crime offerings, our index and investment analytics offerings; the expansion of our listed issuer base as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. Excluding FX and the partial quarter impact of the Verafin acquisition, we achieved organic growth of 13% across our solutions segments.  In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total net revenue in the first quarter, an 11% increase from the prior year period, with contributions across the business during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business grew by 2% versus the prior year period. Our strategy for geographic expansion, particularly in the APAC region, remains strong.  In our Index business, we saw revenue growth of $20 million or 20% versus the prior year period, driven principally by growth in ETP assets, which saw positive net flows of $75 billion over the last 12 months, including meaningful inflows during the especially volatile first quarter itself. We launched 55 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes over the last 12 months, which in turn accumulated $2.5 billion in assets through the end of the quarter.  Notable launches outside the U.S. include the Mara Philex Semiconductor Index ETP and the Samsung Nasdaq 100 ETP. In addition, we created and launched the first index representing the pricing of carbon removal credits during the first quarter based on our activity on our Puro Earth carbon removal marketplace.  Moving from the asset-based index revenues to transactional, the volumes of Nasdaq licensed index futures were particularly strong with a record of over 147 million future contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded in the quarter. And in our Investment Analytics business, revenues grew 13% from the prior year period driven by the sequential impact of strong sales across asset owners, asset managers and private markets throughout 2021.  We are excited about the appointment of Oliver Albers to the Executive Vice President of Investment Intelligence. As a 20-plus year veteran of Nasdaq, Oliver is an experienced, results-oriented leader, who is instrumental in supporting Lauren in strategically repositioning Nasdaq's Investment Intelligence segment into the higher growth, more technology-enabled business you see today.  Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $124 million in total net revenues in the first quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This is primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results year-over-year and more broadly, continued organic growth in the broader anti-financial crime technology business.  Our anti-financial crime technology business had a very strong first quarter, achieving 71% increase in revenues versus the prior year period, partially driven by the partial quarter inclusion of Verafin in the prior year period, the phasing out of revenue write-down associated with the acquisition as well as by strong organic growth with the majority of that coming from the fraud and anti-money laundering, which we call FRAML Solutions.  The growth was driven by both new sales and expanded relationships within our existing client base. We have made meaningful progress in the last 12 months on our objective of helping Verafin expand its client franchise into larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks as well as to innovative fintech companies, all of which account for half of the industry spend.  Since we closed on the acquisition, we have signed 10 new fintech clients and 2 new Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks with several ports of concepts currently underway at major Tier 1 banks. We also launched our first digital assets module for traditional banks and virtual asset service providers, or otherwise known as VAS, including crypto exchanges to detect and investigate fraud and money laundering within digital wallets and in transactions between traditional fiat and digital currencies.  We are committed to supporting the financial ecosystem through its digital transformation by innovating quickly to deliver digital-ready versions of our advanced crime fighting solutions. And as a recent example, we responded quickly to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by expanding our sanctions product to include new sanctions agents for our bank clients.  Verafin is meeting the high expectations we set at the time of the acquisition, while at the same time, the broader Nasdaq team is learning from Verafin in important ways. Their operational expertise as an all SaaS provider is invaluable to us as we build upon and improve our effectiveness in offering our expanded suite of other SaaS offerings.  By bringing together all of Nasdaq's anti-financial crime solutions, including Verafin and our market and trade surveillance solutions under Jamie King, the CEO and Co-Founder of Verafin, we have an incredible opportunity to maximize those cross-product synergies. We're excited to have Jamie as the new Executive Vice President of Nasdaq's ASC business as he leads the future of Nasdaq's high-impact, high-growth solutions that focus on fighting crime and ensuring the integrity of the financial industry.  Within our market infrastructure technology business, the first quarter results continue to reflect the revenue headwinds that we have communicated to investors over the past 2 years since COVID began. As we discussed on prior calls, these headwinds have stemmed from factors that include logistical challenges the pandemic presented to sales, installation and change request work that often occurred on site, as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.  We are pleased that 2 of our post-trade clients successfully went live in the beginning of the second quarter with the first phase of their implementations, and we continue to make good progress in all of our major implementation projects. As I said last quarter, as we reengage in person with our clients, we're starting to see these revenue headwinds recede. With the healthy order intake trends in both 2021 and early 2022, we entered 2022 with an opportunity to improve the organic growth of our market infrastructure solutions as we progress through the year and into 2023.  We have appointed Roland Chi as the new Executive Vice President and leader of our Market Infrastructure Technology business. Roland has been serving as our Chief Risk Officer. And just as importantly, he spent more than a decade leading key technology product areas at several of the world's leading exchange businesses and was, in fact, the customer himself of Nasdaq's marketplace technology. Roland has very specific mandates to strengthen, deepen and progress our client relationships and to continue to innovate across our product suite. I'm excited about this transition as it comes at a time when Nasdaq has never had more to offer to our technology clients, including our next-generation, cloud-native trade life cycle solutions, a newly built cloud-based trading risk management solution and as well as solutions to meet the needs of digital asset marketplaces.  Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $315 million during the first quarter, its second highest quarter ever, second only to Q1 2021. Our market share in U.S. equity saw year-over-year and sequential quarterly improvement, which resulted from an industry uptick in on-exchange trading as well as early success increasing the demand for some of our unique functionalities.  Equity derivatives set a new quarterly net revenue high, up 6%, maintaining our market share in U.S. options in a very busy period while realizing improved capture. Our U.S. options business saw average daily number of contracts traded of $12.8 million during the first quarter and led exchanges with a 32% market share.  And in our Nordic and Baltic markets, equities markets saw robust volumes during the period, with the value of shares traded setting a decade high of EUR 289 billion.  Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered record net revenue of $168 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our continued leadership in new listings across our U.S. and European markets as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services. We saw particularly strong growth in Nasdaq IR Insight and IR advisory offerings as well as across our Government Solutions suite, including our Board meeting management and advisory offerings and Nasdaq One Report, our ESG reporting workflow solution.  Despite the slower start to the year for IPOs, Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting 70 total listings in the U.S. during the quarter, raising $9 billion for an 86% win rate. we listed 100% of all operating company IPOs during the quarter and 80% of stack listings.  In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges welcomed 19 new listings. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our first quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's performance-driven culture and diversified business model enables the company to perform well in different data-driven environments. As a result, we will continue to make focused investments in our businesses to support sustainable growth and expansion of our impact to the financial industry, while also positioning us well as we work towards our medium-term goals.  We remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy, and we believe that Nasdaq is well positioned to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.  Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter 2022 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation.  The 5% increase in reported net revenue of $892 million is the net result of organic growth of 6%, including a 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment, partially offset by a 4% organic decrease in Market Services compared to a record net revenue high in the first quarter of 2021, and the contribution from Verafin as well as impact from divestitures, partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates.  Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% decreased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $329 million or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $327 million or $1.96 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million, an increase of 12%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16.  Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $24 million or 24%. The increase primarily reflects a positive $18 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin, which occurred near the middle of the first quarter of 2021, and $9 million in organic revenue growth, led by our anti-financial crime technology business.  ARR for Market Technology totaled $435 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 3% in the period, well below our objectives. Focusing on the Market Infrastructure Technology business, results continue to reflect the headwinds from logistical challenges the pandemic presented as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.  Investment Intelligence revenue increased $28 million or 11%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $30 million. Organic revenue growth during the period primarily reflects strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as a positive contribution from Market Data.  ARR was $570 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. AUM ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices increased 4% compared to the prior year period to $401 million. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged from the prior year period.  Corporate Platforms revenues increased $22 million or 15%, including 17% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 17% expansion in our listed U.S. corporate issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations, and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings.  Corporate Platforms ARR was $576 million and increased 18% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 45% increased 5 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was primarily driven by growth in the listed issuer base. Market Services net revenues decreased $19 million or 6%. The organic revenue decrease was $13 million or 4%, and there was a $6 million negative impact from changes in FX rates.  The organic decrease primarily reflects lower U.S. equities industry trading volumes compared to the record first quarter 2021 period as well as lower capture in U.S. equities. The segment operating margin of 63% decreased 5 percentage points compared to the very strong prior year period given the lower trading net revenues and the impact of higher professional fees.  Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $35 million to $428 million. The increase reflects a $36 million or 9% organic increase and a $9 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a $10 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.  The organic expense increase is driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting our continued investment in new employees to drive growth. Inflationary pressures on compensation and performance-linked compensation, which continues to reflect the very strong growth across our solutions segment.  We intend to continue investing thoughtfully to maximize the benefits of our expanded customer base and the increasing breadth of capabilities we have developed to expand each relationship. We are revising our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.76 billion, essentially lifting the bottom end of the existing range a bit to account for the very strong organic growth in the Solutions segment businesses to start the year.  Turning to Slide 19. Debt increased by $68 million versus 4Q '21, primarily due to issuance -- the issuance of $550 million of new 3.95% senior unsecured notes due March 2052, partially offset by a net payment of $420 million of commercial paper and a $55 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro.  Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1x, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2021. In April, we used proceeds from the notes offering completed in the first quarter to retire $500 million of bonds maturing in June of 2024. Now let me take a moment to update you on the dividend stock repurchases and our intention to split our stock.  During the first quarter of '22, the company repurchased $467 million in shares, including $325 million related to the previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase program discussed on the 4Q call. Additionally, we are announcing today an 11% increase in the dividend to $0.60 per share.  The company has also began the process of obtaining certain shareholder and SEC approvals to facilitate a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. If such approvals are received, we expect the split to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.  In closing, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 13% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 52% non-GAAP operating margin, what we see as an incredibly strong start to 2022 that we can build upon moving forward.  So thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: On market technology, you get some great growth in the anti-financial crime segment. So I guess the question is can you update us on how the new environment with sanctions, et cetera. Could that be a tailwind? And then staying within the segment, you had market infrastructure technology falloff. And I understand the headwind from the one single project. But even quarter-to-quarter, it fell off. So could you give us an update? I know you mentioned the pandemic-related impacts. But quarter-to-quarter, it seemed like it went $59 million to $52 million as well.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Why don't I actually start with that and then we'll talk about anti-fincrime. So quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, pretty much every year in market infrastructure technology just because we tend to have a lot of, what we call, change requests and other projects that we try to conclude during the quarter. Which then allows us to recognize the revenue in that quarter. And so that tends to be just a seasonally high quarter for us. So that's a general trend.  But in general, but if I look at the market infrastructure technology business more generally, Rich, I think that as you mentioned, we still are facing the impacts of the pandemic just in terms of the level of client engagement we could have with our clients during 2020 and part of 2021.  We did -- I think we are starting to show a recovery in order intakes in the level of engagement we have with our clients. We're back on the road. Roland has been traveling the world visiting our clients again, as has our sales and service teams. So I feel like we really are getting back to a more normal level of engagement.  We're also making good progress on those post-trade implementations. As I mentioned in April, we've had 2 of our clients go live with first phases of that. So that helps also in terms of us getting past those projects, being able to deploy some of those people to other projects, but also just continuing the progress on those big implementations across the franchise. So we feel like we're getting ourselves back into a more normal cadence but it will take time for us to show that through the revenue line.  And I think this quarter kind of reflects that. With regard to the anti-fincrime business, as you mentioned, the sanctions and other just general risks that the financial system has right now, I think, is definitely driving up an interest in making sure that companies have the most advanced solutions for anti-fin crime, that I think it is driving some of the interest that we have from the largest banks, and that's why we've launched a couple of proofs of concepts with some banks and we have others right in the very near-term pipeline for that so that they can start to understand how we can help them solve their problems with, I think, in a more advanced way.  And then the sanctions, that capability, what our -- what the team does is amazing. They have a weekly release cycle. So when the sanctions hit, they were quickly able to update and upgrade the sanction module that we've had in the product for a while to really reflect the newest sanctions, and they're rolling that out to the clients right now. So hopefully, that helps give the color that you're looking for.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, it's very helpful. And Adena, just to follow up. I caught on CNBC, you talked a little bit about the listings pipeline. I didn't catch it all, but could you give us -- I know IPOs have slowed, but it seems like you do have a backlog here, I guess.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. We definitely have a backlog. I think that right now, there are -- if we look just in the SEC filings, we track the S-1 filings. And right now, there are 270 active S-1 filings that have -- that are on file to go to Nasdaq. I think that that's versus 222 filings at the same time last year. So the number of companies that are looking to go out into the public markets remains really strong. We have great engagement with some really interesting and large-cap IPO opportunities.  But they need to feel that the environment is the right environment to go public and that investors are ready to take new risks on new issuers. And I think that's where, right now, they're just tracking that. I think that the markets are volatile, and it makes it harder for investors to predict the future, which makes it harder for them to take those risks.  But we are hopeful that we might see a couple of bear listings come out later in this quarter, but we'll have to see how the markets -- kind of how the markets behave and whether or not it's an inviting environment for them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hope you're all doing well.\nAdena Friedman: How are you, Craig?\nCraig Siegenthaler: I am good. So I had a follow-up to Rich's question on market infrastructure technology. When do you expect the logistical headwinds to fade? And then what type of acceleration revenues could you experience as more clients go live following more normalization in the working environment and understand that the sales cycles can be longer in this business and contract wins can be lumpy, too.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So we're not providing you any sort of a specific outlook or guidance on how we see things proceed. But I would say that what we are feeling more optimistic around is the fact that we are getting through the really big push that we've had on some of these big post-trade implementations, which then, of course, allows us and gives us more confidence to sign new clients, to continue to -- in the post-trade area. And there is -- continues to be a lot of demand from exchanges who want to upgrade and modernize their poster infrastructure, and we now have modern solutions that can really help them.  So I think that's good that we're getting past some of those key implementations. Now we -- those are Phase I. So we still have Phase 2 to implement with some of our clients. But I also would say that it does still allow us to really work on making sure that we build that pipeline for the next group of clients who are going to be moving into the new -- their new clearing and post-trade solutions. But I think that that's, as you said, it takes time, though, because these projects are multiyear projects. They take a long time to get in place. And once you get into implementation and you can start to -- you get a change in how we recognize the license revenue, we go into service and maintenance revenues, and that tends to have a different margin profile, I think that we can -- we feel good that we can start to show that progress in -- as we get later into '22 and into '23. But I just want to say these cycles are long and these projects are important, and we have to make sure that we continue to deliver on them. Hopefully, that helps you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Very helpful. For my follow-up, it was nice to see the 40% year-on-year increase in futures and options contracts on the Nasdaq indexes. Can you quantify what this equates to for revenues within index? And also how we should think about this growth trajectory as more investors trade options based on Nasdaq indexes and maybe also a refresher in terms of how the accelerator math works.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So I'll let Ann answer the first question, and then I'll go into the longer-term trends.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So Craig, on your question about how much. So we don't give specificity at that level. But what I can say is if you look at the index business holistically, about 2/3 of that is asset based and the other 1/3 is the futures, plus some index data.  And just on your question related to the accelerator. So I think we've talked about this coming out of the fourth quarter. In our contract, we have an accelerator that kicks in when we hit certain levels during the year. For the past 2 years, that's happened sort of midyear, end of June-ish. And so we did see a drop. And I think the number we shared coming out of fourth quarter was in reduction related to the accelerator coming off in the first quarter. And then assuming volumes stay at the same level as they were last year, we'd see that sort of pop up towards the middle of the year.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And in terms of the options, the Nasdaq 100 Index options revenues, it's a great question, Craig, because that's an area that our market services business is really working to build.  And we have a great relationship with the small start-up that we have an investment in called Volos that's really helping institutional investors understand how to leg into index options or Nasdaq 100 index options as part of their hedging and their investment strategies. And I think that that's helping build adoption as well.  And so I think that we see that as a really nice growth area for us in the Market Services business. But we're still early in really building up that ecosystem, and we have a lot of opportunity in front of us there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer.\nOwen Lau: So the IR and IR and ESG revenue continues to grind a little bit higher. Could you please give us an update on your ESG initiatives, maybe including some investable products and ESG reporting?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. I think that it really does just reflect good demand. Well, there's 2 things actually: Retention and demand. So I think that the corporate platforms team has done a really nice job of continuing to bring our client retention up year-over-year, which then, of course, allows the team to really focus on sales, which drives growth. . I think the reason that we have the retention we have is certainly product enhancements and capabilities we continue to really invest in those products so that they are truly best-in-class for our customers. I think the second is just that the political environment or I should say, the geopolitical environment, the investment environment, the overall economic environment makes it so that you've got a lot of changes in the engagement with investors and with your Board, there's obviously a lot of interest on the ESG front, and I think that that's an area that's maturing.  But still, corporates are really navigating that and trying to figure out how best to communicate to investors. And our team does a really nice job not only of providing really great software solutions, but also advisory capabilities to help them figure all of that out. And I think that because of the kind of the combination of the advisory team with the SaaS tools is what's really driving a lot of great demand there.  And we feel good about it. I would also just point out, we have 13% more operating companies listed on Nasdaq today than we had a year ago. And we do offer, as part of our IPO package, some of those services, kind of what we call a starter kit for those services. Those packages kind of roll off after 3 years. But also there are additional services we offer for a fee. And I think our clients are realizing that we have a lot that we can do with them to help them navigate through this really unusual environment, and that's also what's driving demand.\nOwen Lau: Got it. And then on crypto, could you please give us an update on your offerings? I think previously, you mentioned there were some crypto clients using your exchange and surveillance solutions. I'm just wondering if you can give us more update on that.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. So you're right. So we have I think it's somewhere in the range of about a dozen crypto exchanges that leverage our technology for trading and then for surveillance. And then we also, as I mentioned, the anti-financial crime team has built a module that's specific to digital assets to help both traditional banks and Bats really help manage their anti-fincrime efforts.  So we're excited that we're rolling that out in the second quarter. And then also we have our crypto index products that we've launched. And so we continue to find ways to engage, Owen, in the crypto space. And we're continuing to watch that space in general, like how it's evolving, how it's maturing, how much institutional interest is coming in to understand how we can continue to expand our offerings over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlexander Kramm: I want to ask a question about trading for one. I guess you're joining a lot of other companies with the announced stock split today. But there's a lot of other Nasdaq-listed companies that are much bigger in terms of trading volumes that have also announced splitting. So I guess this is a no-brainer question. But obviously, I would assume that helps your Nasdaq-listed volumes on the equity side. So maybe you can just talk to that.  But then more importantly, I would be interested in your view on what this means for options volumes. I guess lower share price probably means more contracts traded. But I think there's also this narrative that people have been using options to get into higher-priced stocks in a cheaper way. So just wondering if you've done any work on what stock split from that magnitude could mean on both equities and options.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. Thanks, Alex. Yes. So you are correct that with the stock splits that are happening, I think, first of all, we should probably just say there is true market structure benefits to having a stock price that allows investors, more investors to own your shares directly because that tends to bring more investors into your stock. It tends to bring more trading on to exchange as opposed to through these fractional share offerings that are all off exchange. And that the idea there is that it should drive a tighter spread, and we have a lot of evidence that our economic research department has done around that, which I think helps investors and it helps companies.  So we see it as a net positive. But you're also correct that in the U.S., not in Europe, but in the U.S., we do get paid on shares traded. So if large listings do significant splits, it does increase the shares that are traded in those stocks. But there is a partial countervailing force with options. So you also are correct that we are seeing retail investors would lag in the option in really high-priced stocks and as a way to kind of demonstrate an interest in the stock without having to pay a lot of money for each share.  So there is some offset there in the options market, but we would say that, generally speaking, it's a net positive to see the increase in the share price, the better market structure versus the slight downtick that you might see in some options volumes.\nAlexander Kramm: Okay. Helpful. Secondly, on Verafin and financial crime. I think you talked about those businesses being strong organically. Can you give us some specific numbers, either how Verafin did or how financial crime in total did organically year-over-year, still at 20%, 30% growth rates, I think that we've seen or where you're tracking?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So thanks. Yes, I think we'll talk about the ASC level because that's what we report today, but I'm going to let Ann cover that one.\nAnn Dennison: Sure. So when we look at -- you look at AFC in total, that includes both Verafin and our trade and market surveillance businesses, the organic growth there was 31%. If you sort of adjust that for the deferred revenue write-down, the organic growth versus last year first quarter was 17%. So it's a very healthy combined numbers in that business.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I think one other just point of color to add on Verafin specifically is I think when we went into the acquisition, we indicated that we thought we could generate in the range of $140 million in 2021 for that business. And we exited the year a little above that, quite close to $150 million, which kind of brought us into and they continue to have really strong revenue growth, but it kind of brought us into this year at a nice position.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: One follow-up on trading. Capture rates moved around a fair amount this quarter, particularly within equities. I know that's hard to predict in terms of forecast. But thinking about the current mix of business today, any pricing changes that may or may not have happened. How should we think about some of the capture rates into your biggest asset classes for this year?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. So on equities in the U.S., I think there are 2 forces at play there. One is just a change in the mix of trading. So we had more retail trading last year first quarter, more institutional trading this year first quarter, and that drives just the different behaviors in the markets.  I mean that, I think, has actually resulted in more intraday volumes, which then has just a lower capture rate to it. So that's one component, just the mix of trading.  The second is, though, that we have been focused in on trying to drive volumes into the markets in certain ways. We do, as you know, it's like a monthly activity for us to look at pricing and how we use pricing to drive volumes. And so we did some programs at the beginning of the quarter that are, as I mentioned before, to increase participation in certain parts of our market functionalities. And I think that that's also showing up in terms of some incentives we put in to bring up our share, which has started to show some -- bear some fruit as well.  In options, on the other hand, -- you saw -- I think we've mentioned in the fourth quarter, we have this payment we make to OCC. And I think you go at the end of the year, they have a fee holiday, which then drives down what our stated capture was in Q4. And then we saw -- we expect it to come up a little bit in Q1, which it did.  And then we also had a little bit more institute, again, more institutional involvement in the options markets less retail and retail tends to come in at a lower price. So our options capture went up a little bit just by that change in mix.\nDaniel Fannon: Got it. That's helpful. And then just a question on expenses and the clarification around the change in the guidance, reflecting strong growth across the solutions business. And so I think you've talked about Verafin and some other businesses doing well. But you obviously budget for growth. So I wanted to get specifically which program, which segments are really tracking that far above the budget that would -- that is driving the change in expenses, your guidance this early in the year?\nAnn Dennison: So Dan, I think it's fairly straightforward. You can think about it. We talk about our medium-term outlook for the Solutions segment in the aggregate as being at 6% to 9% growth. And so this quarter, collectively, we put up 13% organic growth, so well above that 6% to 9%. And so that's how we think about it.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, in terms of -- and so -- and I think also to mention is, as we mentioned before, we're not increasing the top end of the expense guidance range, but we are bringing up the bottom just to show the fact that we are continuing to invest -- and if you look at it, it's actually coming across a lot of different parts of our business. It's in the anti-fincrime space, it's in the corporate platform space and it's in the investment intelligence space. And so those areas are we're doing really well in engaging with clients, and we want to make sure that that's sustainable.  So we're investing in growing our teams and making sure that they're doing the job that they need to do to service our clients -- our growing client base successfully.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Blostein: A question for you around the multi-listed option space. We've seen Nasdaq's market share slip there for the last couple of quarters now, and we've obviously seen some headlines around exchanges, newer exchanges dipping their tail into that marketplace as well.  Look, I think over time, Nasdaq has done a really nice job kind of focusing on revenue and that market share, which is great and kind of keeping the capture rates in place from a revenue perspective. But how are you thinking about, I guess, optimizing this business going forward in light of rising competition? And how important is it to stay in over sort of north of 30-ish percent market share here? So I guess to what extent will pricing competition start to impact that business over the next few quarters and years?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I mean I would say we've been managing through a really dynamic auctions environment for a long time. So I think that there are less for like 13 options exchanges, 14 options exchanges. So having additional options exchanges come in is something that's just part of the ecosystem today.  I think that in terms of how we manage that, as you said, we are really thoughtful about how -- what kind of flow that we think is really optimally attractive to us in terms of the types of markets we have. So we really look at it. We have 6 options exchanges. We can have different types of investors and participants in each of those exchanges. We think about pricing on each of those exchanges individually. And we can basically allow for the most complex options traders to come in through Philex and IC and the most basic retail traders to come in through GMX and MRx and others. So we try really hard, Alex, to make sure that we are balancing what we're trying to achieve with our platforms, what kind of investors we want to have in our platforms and how we serve them the right way. I think that the newer exchanges that are coming in are really competing really on those lower-end platforms that have the lowest capture, but they don't necessarily serve the more complex traders.  I think the last thing I would say is part of the thing we also are focused on is our proprietary product franchise because we do think that we have some really interesting assets that we can bring into our options markets or having our options markets that really do have a different characteristic to them. So in addition to competing really actively, and we always will and we do that quite well, I think that we also are really trying to build up our proprietary product franchise as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Maybe just focus back on anti-financial crime. Now sort of with more sort of a combination of the anti -- the legacy anti-financial crime businesses with Verafin under Jamie, and as you look at those cross-product synergies and also the organic growth that you've talked about with more crypto surveillance on digital wallets and obviously, growth in sanctions of agents monitoring, can you give us a sense for that whole unit?  Obviously, Verafin was growing at 30%. But just for that entire unit combined with the synergies if -- what type of growth outlook would you see in the medium term given sort of the improvement in that since you did the Verafin acquisition. I know when you did it at that time, there was this -- it was a -- that segment was projected to grow at around a 17% rate at least industry-wide. Just getting a sense -- trying to get a sense of whether you think that rate could be moderately faster for Nasdaq over the next 2 to 3 years?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I think that in general, you are -- you've touched a lot on where we see the opportunity, I think, that within the anti-fincrime space. The teams -- after the Verafin acquisition, the teams started to engage right away on how we could leverage all of the client relationships we have with our surveillance business to open doors for Verafin into the larger firms. And I think we're really being successful at doing that. . But now, with the teams more integrated, they've come together, they've had some really interesting strategy sections on how to really optimize the relationships with the clients, how to bring the product market together. Any sort of product integration will take time, right? So that's a multiyear plan.  But in terms of continuing to really build that pipeline of opportunities for us to open doors for Verafin as well as to think about even how do we take to the surveillance product to smaller clients because Verafin has done such a great job there. These are all things that we are excited to work on.  But generally speaking, what all of that means is that we have an overall medium-term outlook for the Market Technology business, which includes market infrastructure technology and anti-fincrime of 13% to 16% growth. And so everything we're doing in the anti-fincrime space really helps support that overall market tech number of the 13% to 16% growth.  If we find that we are having more success or earlier success than we anticipate in some of the work we're doing in anti-fincrime, we'll look at whether or not we would make adjustments there. But right now, I think that that's -- the outlook is consistent with how we see that business developing.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. That's fair enough. And then just on timing and maybe you may or may not be able to answer this. But on the infrastructure market side, given all of the headwinds that you talked about and now lapping that contract, do you think you can grow revenue in that segment year-over-year by the third quarter through the fourth quarter?  And then if I can just ask also just on the crypto index licenses that you talked about. Will that revenue be seen in the index licensing part of Investment Intelligence? And is that material yet? Or is that more of a longer-term growth development?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, we don't talk about like intra-year outlook any particular business. But I would say that as we have been mentioning that we had that 1 contract roll-off that rolled off in July of last year, so you kind of take that and lap that through the end of June.  I think that we are seeing strong engagement. We've had record order intake last year. We've had a good start to the year from an order intake perspective. And so we do feel like there are good signals that we will have the opportunity to grow that business. But obviously, we don't give intra year outlook or guidance on that.  In terms of the crypto indexes, we actually launched that product, I believe, beginning of 2021, maybe or maybe it was 2020. And it actually, it was an index that's based outside the U.S., and it is generating nice revenue for us, but that's already incorporated into the revenue for the index sector all in. So hopefully, it's not hugely significant. I just want to say that. It's a nice grower, but not in the context of how big that business is today. It's not a huge -- it's not a significant mover.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley.\nMichael Cyprys: I wanted to ask about the AWS partnership. I know you've spoken about that on some of the prior calls. But I was just hoping you might be able to update us there on the migration of the Market Services business over to the cloud. And as you're deploying and moving forward with the AWS partnership, what are some of the key challenges that you're facing and deploying to the cloud? And maybe you could just give us a sense of some of the steps you're taking to overcome any of those sort of challenges and what you're doing to get comfortable there?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Hey, Michael. So thanks for asking about that because we didn't mention that in the script. But it's moving along quite well. I think that we are heavily engaged with AWS. They're deploying their outpost solution into our data center. And on May 3, I think it is, that we're going to have our groundbreaking at Carteret because we're with Equinix and our partners there because we are breaking ground to expand that data center. That data center expansion will be done in 2024, which then allows us to offer more capabilities to our clients, expand the AWS presence and make it so that we can continue to really create that private local zone that is available to our ecosystem of market participants and investment clients beyond what we do today.  But that's -- it's going to take a couple of years for that to come online. But in the meantime, we are -- AWS is deeply engaged with our engineering team, our infrastructure team and our development team to make sure that we are on track with our MRx migration.  And as we mentioned, our goal is to have MRx, which is one of our options exchanges, migrate over to the Outpost implementation and on to our new Fusion platform before the end of this year. And so we're on track with that. There aren't any major challenges that I think that are impeding our progress at all. We're learning as we go for sure, but it's been a spectacular partnership so far.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Just wondering if you could tell us if you make any fee changes in the listings business or other notable changes across your other nontransaction businesses to start 2022 and if inflation continues to run at elevated levels, I'm just wondering if you consider adjusting price more than you have historically in the form of CPI adjustments or other pricing adjustments.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So we -- every year, we -- or in the last few, we do this now on an annual basis, we provide a small change to our listing fees to reflect the continued investment we're making in that business. And so that -- and we did that as we have in prior years. So there was no difference there.  I think that -- I think in general, though, we have done some work to understand the inflationary environment, the way that we engage with our clients on pricing. In some cases, we do have annual CPI adjustments to our products. In other cases, we don't have to have the same flexibility, but we look at the value we're providing to our clients over time or upon contract renewal. And so we are certainly being proactive in evaluating that.  But as I mentioned in my remarks, we do take a long-term approach to our clients so that we can sustain them as clients, grow them as clients over the long term and that then, of course, accrues to the benefit of the shareholders over the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse.\nGautam Sawant: During the quarter, an engagement in Brazil was announced to launch a carbon credit and sustainable assets exchange. What other opportunities are available internationally? And what types of exchanges are they looking to launch?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So that was actually a technology agreement that we signed with the client in Brazil. So we actually have a carbon removal marketplace that we have a 70% ownership in called Curo Earth, which is based in Finland, but it is a global platform. The largest companies in the world rely upon us to find really high-quality carbon removal credits and suppliers of that. And I think we do an excellent job, and it's really been a really interesting area for us. It's very small.  So we don't talk a lot about it yet. But it is certainly a growth engine for us in Europe to help companies around the world manage their carbon output through high-quality industrial carbon removals, and we're also moving into nature-based car removals. So that's an area as an operator, we're really engaged in. And then we also, of course, can provide the same technology we're using for our markets to open up those opportunities for other markets, and we are engaged with other clients, some of our tech clients on their ambitions to launch these carbon offset markets. So I think you'll see more of that over time. We just -- it's very early days, though.  All right. Well, I want to say I think that's all the questions. So thank you very much for your time today. And in closing, Nasdaq's first quarter results demonstrate how we're off to a strong start in 2022, and I look forward to our continued discussions throughout the year regarding our progress. So thank you very much, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'd like to begin my remarks today by addressing the current market landscape.  As I've noted in past calls, the Nasdaq team has become familiar with how unpredictable today's operating environment can be. The first quarter of 2022 was certainly no different, given the dynamic geopolitical and economic factors we experienced during the period. As I've noted in prior public comments, the war in Ukraine is a terrible tragedy, and we stand with the greater business community urgently calling for peace. Nasdaq has a proud and long-standing position in Europe, which includes 7 markets we operate across the Nordic and Baltic countries, specifically Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden. We've been extremely diligent in monitoring the threat environment in Europe and across our global operations to protect our employees and to ensure the resiliency of our markets and client solutions.  Our revenue exposure to Russian clients was de minimis, and we remain committed to ensuring full compliance with all relevant sanctions. In addition, our global workforce is highly engaged in humanitarian and philanthropic efforts to support the needs of those impacted by the senseless war. It fills me with immense pride to see the outpouring of support across our employee base.  Regarding the backdrop we are operating against, our corporate clients and our investor clients are navigating through a very dynamic environment, where strong economic growth has been accompanied with significant inflation, continued supply chain and labor shortage challenges and increasing geopolitical impacts. This environment creates volatility in markets, which tends to be a volume driver, and we have continued to experience strong volumes across our U.S. and European markets. It also creates an uncertain landscape for investors to navigate, resulting in a slowdown in capital raising activities, including IPOs.  And depending on the way the markets are moving, it creates interesting dynamics for our index business. This quarter, the drop in market cap was offset partially by inflows into our index products and strong index futures volumes.  Looking beyond the direct market impacts, because we offer solutions that help our clients navigate through these uncertain times, it's actually increased our client engagement in 3 key areas where we have secular growth. Our bank clients are managing increasingly complex geopolitical risks, which results in strong demand for advanced anti-financial crime solutions, which we offer with Verafin.  Asset owners, including pensions, sovereign wealth funds and endowments, are making quick asset allocation changes and must manage their portfolios very carefully, which increases their reliance on our eVestment and Solovis offerings. On the corporate side, our clients are navigating through a dynamic ESG environment, which drives demand for our ESG advisory and reporting solutions.  Overall, our diversified business model gives us the means to be able to manage successfully in this environment recognizing, of course, that there are a lot of different forces at play. And in that context, let me briefly address the inflation-related pressures, which are certainly factors we are navigating as is the broader corporate community.  On the revenue side, we are fortunate to benefit from a highly diversified revenue mix based on providing mission-critical solutions that support our clients and the broader financial system around the world. We take a long-term approach to value creation for our shareholders in the context of serving our clients, and we will continue to manage that balance thoughtfully.  In addition, we are actively managing the evolution of inflationary pressures across our expense base. Our current expense guidance reflects the near-term actions we have taken to address the challenges of recruiting and retaining a highly skilled team in today's economy, and we'll continue to monitor the situation over time.  Our team's focus on secular opportunities to drive organic growth as well as our business model's reliance on recurring revenue components has enabled Nasdaq to continue our track record of growth as we execute against our longer-term objectives. The record net revenue we achieved in the quarter against this very dynamic backdrop illustrates the strength of Nasdaq's business model.  Next, I'd like to take a brief moment to thank 2 of our senior leaders for their years of impactful contributions to Nasdaq following the announcements that they will be moving on to new chapters in their lives. First, I want to congratulate Lars Ottersgard for his 16 years of leading our Market Technology business. During his tenure, he led a dramatic expansion in the capabilities and client network for the business and helped advance our ongoing transition to a more scalable SaaS-focused orientation.  I also want to thank Lauren Dillard, who in her 3 years at Nasdaq delivered tremendous impact in strategically repositioning the Investment Intelligence business that now features a majority of revenue contribution from higher growth index and analytics products. We're incredibly excited about the strong successors we announced during the quarter for the market technology and Investment and Intelligence segments.  Specifically, Jamie King, who joined us from Verafin, will lead the anti-financial crime technology business. Roland Chai, who joined in Nasdaq in 2020, will lead the market infrastructure technology business. Those 2 businesses will continue to roll out to form the Market Technology segment. Oliver Albers, a long-standing Nasdaq executive will lead our Investment Intelligence segment. All 3 are respected leaders in their fields with deep industry expertise and a proven track record of success. Let's now turn to our results.  I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's strong financial performance for the first quarter of 2022. We achieved a record $892 million in net revenues, a 5% increase compared to what was itself a very strong prior year period when the company previously set a quarterly record on trading revenues. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 9% to $1.91 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million in the first quarter of 2022, representing 34% of our total company ARR, reflecting particularly strong growth in our anti-financial crime and investment analytics businesses.  Our recurring revenues and their consistent growth provide a powerful starting point for our overall performance, but we also delivered strong results across both index licensing and trading revenues. This solid start to the year positions us well to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.  Turning next to specific highlights from our business segments. Our Solutions segment businesses delivered combined total revenue of $576 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven from several of our businesses, including our anti-financial crime offerings, our index and investment analytics offerings; the expansion of our listed issuer base as well as strong demand for our IR and ESG services. Excluding FX and the partial quarter impact of the Verafin acquisition, we achieved organic growth of 13% across our solutions segments.  In our Investment Intelligence segment, we delivered $284 million in total net revenue in the first quarter, an 11% increase from the prior year period, with contributions across the business during the quarter. Revenue in our market data business grew by 2% versus the prior year period. Our strategy for geographic expansion, particularly in the APAC region, remains strong.  In our Index business, we saw revenue growth of $20 million or 20% versus the prior year period, driven principally by growth in ETP assets, which saw positive net flows of $75 billion over the last 12 months, including meaningful inflows during the especially volatile first quarter itself. We launched 55 ETFs tracking Nasdaq indexes over the last 12 months, which in turn accumulated $2.5 billion in assets through the end of the quarter.  Notable launches outside the U.S. include the Mara Philex Semiconductor Index ETP and the Samsung Nasdaq 100 ETP. In addition, we created and launched the first index representing the pricing of carbon removal credits during the first quarter based on our activity on our Puro Earth carbon removal marketplace.  Moving from the asset-based index revenues to transactional, the volumes of Nasdaq licensed index futures were particularly strong with a record of over 147 million future contracts tied to the Nasdaq 100 traded in the quarter. And in our Investment Analytics business, revenues grew 13% from the prior year period driven by the sequential impact of strong sales across asset owners, asset managers and private markets throughout 2021.  We are excited about the appointment of Oliver Albers to the Executive Vice President of Investment Intelligence. As a 20-plus year veteran of Nasdaq, Oliver is an experienced, results-oriented leader, who is instrumental in supporting Lauren in strategically repositioning Nasdaq's Investment Intelligence segment into the higher growth, more technology-enabled business you see today.  Turning next to our Market Technology segment. We delivered $124 million in total net revenues in the first quarter, a 24% increase from the prior year period. This is primarily driven by the inclusion of revenues from Verafin in our results year-over-year and more broadly, continued organic growth in the broader anti-financial crime technology business.  Our anti-financial crime technology business had a very strong first quarter, achieving 71% increase in revenues versus the prior year period, partially driven by the partial quarter inclusion of Verafin in the prior year period, the phasing out of revenue write-down associated with the acquisition as well as by strong organic growth with the majority of that coming from the fraud and anti-money laundering, which we call FRAML Solutions.  The growth was driven by both new sales and expanded relationships within our existing client base. We have made meaningful progress in the last 12 months on our objective of helping Verafin expand its client franchise into larger Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks as well as to innovative fintech companies, all of which account for half of the industry spend.  Since we closed on the acquisition, we have signed 10 new fintech clients and 2 new Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks with several ports of concepts currently underway at major Tier 1 banks. We also launched our first digital assets module for traditional banks and virtual asset service providers, or otherwise known as VAS, including crypto exchanges to detect and investigate fraud and money laundering within digital wallets and in transactions between traditional fiat and digital currencies.  We are committed to supporting the financial ecosystem through its digital transformation by innovating quickly to deliver digital-ready versions of our advanced crime fighting solutions. And as a recent example, we responded quickly to the Russian invasion of Ukraine by expanding our sanctions product to include new sanctions agents for our bank clients.  Verafin is meeting the high expectations we set at the time of the acquisition, while at the same time, the broader Nasdaq team is learning from Verafin in important ways. Their operational expertise as an all SaaS provider is invaluable to us as we build upon and improve our effectiveness in offering our expanded suite of other SaaS offerings.  By bringing together all of Nasdaq's anti-financial crime solutions, including Verafin and our market and trade surveillance solutions under Jamie King, the CEO and Co-Founder of Verafin, we have an incredible opportunity to maximize those cross-product synergies. We're excited to have Jamie as the new Executive Vice President of Nasdaq's ASC business as he leads the future of Nasdaq's high-impact, high-growth solutions that focus on fighting crime and ensuring the integrity of the financial industry.  Within our market infrastructure technology business, the first quarter results continue to reflect the revenue headwinds that we have communicated to investors over the past 2 years since COVID began. As we discussed on prior calls, these headwinds have stemmed from factors that include logistical challenges the pandemic presented to sales, installation and change request work that often occurred on site, as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.  We are pleased that 2 of our post-trade clients successfully went live in the beginning of the second quarter with the first phase of their implementations, and we continue to make good progress in all of our major implementation projects. As I said last quarter, as we reengage in person with our clients, we're starting to see these revenue headwinds recede. With the healthy order intake trends in both 2021 and early 2022, we entered 2022 with an opportunity to improve the organic growth of our market infrastructure solutions as we progress through the year and into 2023.  We have appointed Roland Chi as the new Executive Vice President and leader of our Market Infrastructure Technology business. Roland has been serving as our Chief Risk Officer. And just as importantly, he spent more than a decade leading key technology product areas at several of the world's leading exchange businesses and was, in fact, the customer himself of Nasdaq's marketplace technology. Roland has very specific mandates to strengthen, deepen and progress our client relationships and to continue to innovate across our product suite. I'm excited about this transition as it comes at a time when Nasdaq has never had more to offer to our technology clients, including our next-generation, cloud-native trade life cycle solutions, a newly built cloud-based trading risk management solution and as well as solutions to meet the needs of digital asset marketplaces.  Moving to our foundational marketplace businesses. Our Market Services segment delivered net revenues of $315 million during the first quarter, its second highest quarter ever, second only to Q1 2021. Our market share in U.S. equity saw year-over-year and sequential quarterly improvement, which resulted from an industry uptick in on-exchange trading as well as early success increasing the demand for some of our unique functionalities.  Equity derivatives set a new quarterly net revenue high, up 6%, maintaining our market share in U.S. options in a very busy period while realizing improved capture. Our U.S. options business saw average daily number of contracts traded of $12.8 million during the first quarter and led exchanges with a 32% market share.  And in our Nordic and Baltic markets, equities markets saw robust volumes during the period, with the value of shares traded setting a decade high of EUR 289 billion.  Finally, our Corporate Platform segment delivered record net revenue of $168 million in the first quarter, a 15% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by our continued leadership in new listings across our U.S. and European markets as well as growth in demand for our IR and ESG services. We saw particularly strong growth in Nasdaq IR Insight and IR advisory offerings as well as across our Government Solutions suite, including our Board meeting management and advisory offerings and Nasdaq One Report, our ESG reporting workflow solution.  Despite the slower start to the year for IPOs, Nasdaq continued its competitive leadership in attracting 70 total listings in the U.S. during the quarter, raising $9 billion for an 86% win rate. we listed 100% of all operating company IPOs during the quarter and 80% of stack listings.  In Europe, our Nordic, Baltic and First North exchanges welcomed 19 new listings. As I wrap up, I will summarize by saying that our first quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's performance-driven culture and diversified business model enables the company to perform well in different data-driven environments. As a result, we will continue to make focused investments in our businesses to support sustainable growth and expansion of our impact to the financial industry, while also positioning us well as we work towards our medium-term goals.  We remain relentlessly focused on advancing our strategy, and we believe that Nasdaq is well positioned to address the geopolitical and economic uncertainties that may persist as we move forward in 2022.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review the financial details. Sure. Yes. Why don't I actually start with that and then we'll talk about anti-fincrime. So quarter-over-quarter, the fourth quarter is a seasonally high quarter for us, pretty much every year in market infrastructure technology just because we tend to have a lot of, what we call, change requests and other projects that we try to conclude during the quarter. Which then allows us to recognize the revenue in that quarter. And so that tends to be just a seasonally high quarter for us. So that's a general trend.  But in general, but if I look at the market infrastructure technology business more generally, Rich, I think that as you mentioned, we still are facing the impacts of the pandemic just in terms of the level of client engagement we could have with our clients during 2020 and part of 2021.  We did -- I think we are starting to show a recovery in order intakes in the level of engagement we have with our clients. We're back on the road. Roland has been traveling the world visiting our clients again, as has our sales and service teams. So I feel like we really are getting back to a more normal level of engagement.  We're also making good progress on those post-trade implementations. As I mentioned in April, we've had 2 of our clients go live with first phases of that. So that helps also in terms of us getting past those projects, being able to deploy some of those people to other projects, but also just continuing the progress on those big implementations across the franchise. So we feel like we're getting ourselves back into a more normal cadence but it will take time for us to show that through the revenue line.  And I think this quarter kind of reflects that. With regard to the anti-fincrime business, as you mentioned, the sanctions and other just general risks that the financial system has right now, I think, is definitely driving up an interest in making sure that companies have the most advanced solutions for anti-fin crime, that I think it is driving some of the interest that we have from the largest banks, and that's why we've launched a couple of proofs of concepts with some banks and we have others right in the very near-term pipeline for that so that they can start to understand how we can help them solve their problems with, I think, in a more advanced way.  And then the sanctions, that capability, what our -- what the team does is amazing. They have a weekly release cycle. So when the sanctions hit, they were quickly able to update and upgrade the sanction module that we've had in the product for a while to really reflect the newest sanctions, and they're rolling that out to the clients right now. So hopefully, that helps give the color that you're looking for. Yes. We definitely have a backlog. I think that right now, there are -- if we look just in the SEC filings, we track the S-1 filings. And right now, there are 270 active S-1 filings that have -- that are on file to go to Nasdaq. I think that that's versus 222 filings at the same time last year. So the number of companies that are looking to go out into the public markets remains really strong. We have great engagement with some really interesting and large-cap IPO opportunities.  But they need to feel that the environment is the right environment to go public and that investors are ready to take new risks on new issuers. And I think that's where, right now, they're just tracking that. I think that the markets are volatile, and it makes it harder for investors to predict the future, which makes it harder for them to take those risks.  But we are hopeful that we might see a couple of bear listings come out later in this quarter, but we'll have to see how the markets -- kind of how the markets behave and whether or not it's an inviting environment for them. How are you, Craig? Yes. So we're not providing you any sort of a specific outlook or guidance on how we see things proceed. But I would say that what we are feeling more optimistic around is the fact that we are getting through the really big push that we've had on some of these big post-trade implementations, which then, of course, allows us and gives us more confidence to sign new clients, to continue to -- in the post-trade area. And there is -- continues to be a lot of demand from exchanges who want to upgrade and modernize their poster infrastructure, and we now have modern solutions that can really help them.  So I think that's good that we're getting past some of those key implementations. Now we -- those are Phase I. So we still have Phase 2 to implement with some of our clients. But I also would say that it does still allow us to really work on making sure that we build that pipeline for the next group of clients who are going to be moving into the new -- their new clearing and post-trade solutions. But I think that that's, as you said, it takes time, though, because these projects are multiyear projects. They take a long time to get in place. And once you get into implementation and you can start to -- you get a change in how we recognize the license revenue, we go into service and maintenance revenues, and that tends to have a different margin profile, I think that we can -- we feel good that we can start to show that progress in -- as we get later into '22 and into '23. But I just want to say these cycles are long and these projects are important, and we have to make sure that we continue to deliver on them. Hopefully, that helps you. Yes. So I'll let Ann answer the first question, and then I'll go into the longer-term trends. Yes. And in terms of the options, the Nasdaq 100 Index options revenues, it's a great question, Craig, because that's an area that our market services business is really working to build.  And we have a great relationship with the small start-up that we have an investment in called Volos that's really helping institutional investors understand how to leg into index options or Nasdaq 100 index options as part of their hedging and their investment strategies. And I think that that's helping build adoption as well.  And so I think that we see that as a really nice growth area for us in the Market Services business. But we're still early in really building up that ecosystem, and we have a lot of opportunity in front of us there. Sure. Yes. I think that it really does just reflect good demand. Well, there's 2 things actually: Retention and demand. So I think that the corporate platforms team has done a really nice job of continuing to bring our client retention up year-over-year, which then, of course, allows the team to really focus on sales, which drives growth. . I think the reason that we have the retention we have is certainly product enhancements and capabilities we continue to really invest in those products so that they are truly best-in-class for our customers. I think the second is just that the political environment or I should say, the geopolitical environment, the investment environment, the overall economic environment makes it so that you've got a lot of changes in the engagement with investors and with your Board, there's obviously a lot of interest on the ESG front, and I think that that's an area that's maturing.  But still, corporates are really navigating that and trying to figure out how best to communicate to investors. And our team does a really nice job not only of providing really great software solutions, but also advisory capabilities to help them figure all of that out. And I think that because of the kind of the combination of the advisory team with the SaaS tools is what's really driving a lot of great demand there.  And we feel good about it. I would also just point out, we have 13% more operating companies listed on Nasdaq today than we had a year ago. And we do offer, as part of our IPO package, some of those services, kind of what we call a starter kit for those services. Those packages kind of roll off after 3 years. But also there are additional services we offer for a fee. And I think our clients are realizing that we have a lot that we can do with them to help them navigate through this really unusual environment, and that's also what's driving demand. Yes, sure. So you're right. So we have I think it's somewhere in the range of about a dozen crypto exchanges that leverage our technology for trading and then for surveillance. And then we also, as I mentioned, the anti-financial crime team has built a module that's specific to digital assets to help both traditional banks and Bats really help manage their anti-fincrime efforts.  So we're excited that we're rolling that out in the second quarter. And then also we have our crypto index products that we've launched. And so we continue to find ways to engage, Owen, in the crypto space. And we're continuing to watch that space in general, like how it's evolving, how it's maturing, how much institutional interest is coming in to understand how we can continue to expand our offerings over time. Yes. Thanks, Alex. Yes. So you are correct that with the stock splits that are happening, I think, first of all, we should probably just say there is true market structure benefits to having a stock price that allows investors, more investors to own your shares directly because that tends to bring more investors into your stock. It tends to bring more trading on to exchange as opposed to through these fractional share offerings that are all off exchange. And that the idea there is that it should drive a tighter spread, and we have a lot of evidence that our economic research department has done around that, which I think helps investors and it helps companies.  So we see it as a net positive. But you're also correct that in the U.S., not in Europe, but in the U.S., we do get paid on shares traded. So if large listings do significant splits, it does increase the shares that are traded in those stocks. But there is a partial countervailing force with options. So you also are correct that we are seeing retail investors would lag in the option in really high-priced stocks and as a way to kind of demonstrate an interest in the stock without having to pay a lot of money for each share.  So there is some offset there in the options market, but we would say that, generally speaking, it's a net positive to see the increase in the share price, the better market structure versus the slight downtick that you might see in some options volumes. Yes. So thanks. Yes, I think we'll talk about the ASC level because that's what we report today, but I'm going to let Ann cover that one. Yes. And I think one other just point of color to add on Verafin specifically is I think when we went into the acquisition, we indicated that we thought we could generate in the range of $140 million in 2021 for that business. And we exited the year a little above that, quite close to $150 million, which kind of brought us into and they continue to have really strong revenue growth, but it kind of brought us into this year at a nice position. Sure. Yes. So on equities in the U.S., I think there are 2 forces at play there. One is just a change in the mix of trading. So we had more retail trading last year first quarter, more institutional trading this year first quarter, and that drives just the different behaviors in the markets.  I mean that, I think, has actually resulted in more intraday volumes, which then has just a lower capture rate to it. So that's one component, just the mix of trading.  The second is, though, that we have been focused in on trying to drive volumes into the markets in certain ways. We do, as you know, it's like a monthly activity for us to look at pricing and how we use pricing to drive volumes. And so we did some programs at the beginning of the quarter that are, as I mentioned before, to increase participation in certain parts of our market functionalities. And I think that that's also showing up in terms of some incentives we put in to bring up our share, which has started to show some -- bear some fruit as well.  In options, on the other hand, -- you saw -- I think we've mentioned in the fourth quarter, we have this payment we make to OCC. And I think you go at the end of the year, they have a fee holiday, which then drives down what our stated capture was in Q4. And then we saw -- we expect it to come up a little bit in Q1, which it did.  And then we also had a little bit more institute, again, more institutional involvement in the options markets less retail and retail tends to come in at a lower price. So our options capture went up a little bit just by that change in mix. Yes, in terms of -- and so -- and I think also to mention is, as we mentioned before, we're not increasing the top end of the expense guidance range, but we are bringing up the bottom just to show the fact that we are continuing to invest -- and if you look at it, it's actually coming across a lot of different parts of our business. It's in the anti-fincrime space, it's in the corporate platform space and it's in the investment intelligence space. And so those areas are we're doing really well in engaging with clients, and we want to make sure that that's sustainable.  So we're investing in growing our teams and making sure that they're doing the job that they need to do to service our clients -- our growing client base successfully. Yes. I mean I would say we've been managing through a really dynamic auctions environment for a long time. So I think that there are less for like 13 options exchanges, 14 options exchanges. So having additional options exchanges come in is something that's just part of the ecosystem today.  I think that in terms of how we manage that, as you said, we are really thoughtful about how -- what kind of flow that we think is really optimally attractive to us in terms of the types of markets we have. So we really look at it. We have 6 options exchanges. We can have different types of investors and participants in each of those exchanges. We think about pricing on each of those exchanges individually. And we can basically allow for the most complex options traders to come in through Philex and IC and the most basic retail traders to come in through GMX and MRx and others. So we try really hard, Alex, to make sure that we are balancing what we're trying to achieve with our platforms, what kind of investors we want to have in our platforms and how we serve them the right way. I think that the newer exchanges that are coming in are really competing really on those lower-end platforms that have the lowest capture, but they don't necessarily serve the more complex traders.  I think the last thing I would say is part of the thing we also are focused on is our proprietary product franchise because we do think that we have some really interesting assets that we can bring into our options markets or having our options markets that really do have a different characteristic to them. So in addition to competing really actively, and we always will and we do that quite well, I think that we also are really trying to build up our proprietary product franchise as well. Yes. I think that in general, you are -- you've touched a lot on where we see the opportunity, I think, that within the anti-fincrime space. The teams -- after the Verafin acquisition, the teams started to engage right away on how we could leverage all of the client relationships we have with our surveillance business to open doors for Verafin into the larger firms. And I think we're really being successful at doing that. . But now, with the teams more integrated, they've come together, they've had some really interesting strategy sections on how to really optimize the relationships with the clients, how to bring the product market together. Any sort of product integration will take time, right? So that's a multiyear plan.  But in terms of continuing to really build that pipeline of opportunities for us to open doors for Verafin as well as to think about even how do we take to the surveillance product to smaller clients because Verafin has done such a great job there. These are all things that we are excited to work on.  But generally speaking, what all of that means is that we have an overall medium-term outlook for the Market Technology business, which includes market infrastructure technology and anti-fincrime of 13% to 16% growth. And so everything we're doing in the anti-fincrime space really helps support that overall market tech number of the 13% to 16% growth.  If we find that we are having more success or earlier success than we anticipate in some of the work we're doing in anti-fincrime, we'll look at whether or not we would make adjustments there. But right now, I think that that's -- the outlook is consistent with how we see that business developing. Sure. Well, we don't talk about like intra-year outlook any particular business. But I would say that as we have been mentioning that we had that 1 contract roll-off that rolled off in July of last year, so you kind of take that and lap that through the end of June.  I think that we are seeing strong engagement. We've had record order intake last year. We've had a good start to the year from an order intake perspective. And so we do feel like there are good signals that we will have the opportunity to grow that business. But obviously, we don't give intra year outlook or guidance on that.  In terms of the crypto indexes, we actually launched that product, I believe, beginning of 2021, maybe or maybe it was 2020. And it actually, it was an index that's based outside the U.S., and it is generating nice revenue for us, but that's already incorporated into the revenue for the index sector all in. So hopefully, it's not hugely significant. I just want to say that. It's a nice grower, but not in the context of how big that business is today. It's not a huge -- it's not a significant mover. Sure. Yes. Hey, Michael. So thanks for asking about that because we didn't mention that in the script. But it's moving along quite well. I think that we are heavily engaged with AWS. They're deploying their outpost solution into our data center. And on May 3, I think it is, that we're going to have our groundbreaking at Carteret because we're with Equinix and our partners there because we are breaking ground to expand that data center. That data center expansion will be done in 2024, which then allows us to offer more capabilities to our clients, expand the AWS presence and make it so that we can continue to really create that private local zone that is available to our ecosystem of market participants and investment clients beyond what we do today.  But that's -- it's going to take a couple of years for that to come online. But in the meantime, we are -- AWS is deeply engaged with our engineering team, our infrastructure team and our development team to make sure that we are on track with our MRx migration.  And as we mentioned, our goal is to have MRx, which is one of our options exchanges, migrate over to the Outpost implementation and on to our new Fusion platform before the end of this year. And so we're on track with that. There aren't any major challenges that I think that are impeding our progress at all. We're learning as we go for sure, but it's been a spectacular partnership so far. Yes. So we -- every year, we -- or in the last few, we do this now on an annual basis, we provide a small change to our listing fees to reflect the continued investment we're making in that business. And so that -- and we did that as we have in prior years. So there was no difference there.  I think that -- I think in general, though, we have done some work to understand the inflationary environment, the way that we engage with our clients on pricing. In some cases, we do have annual CPI adjustments to our products. In other cases, we don't have to have the same flexibility, but we look at the value we're providing to our clients over time or upon contract renewal. And so we are certainly being proactive in evaluating that.  But as I mentioned in my remarks, we do take a long-term approach to our clients so that we can sustain them as clients, grow them as clients over the long term and that then, of course, accrues to the benefit of the shareholders over the long term. Yes. So that was actually a technology agreement that we signed with the client in Brazil. So we actually have a carbon removal marketplace that we have a 70% ownership in called Curo Earth, which is based in Finland, but it is a global platform. The largest companies in the world rely upon us to find really high-quality carbon removal credits and suppliers of that. And I think we do an excellent job, and it's really been a really interesting area for us. It's very small.  So we don't talk a lot about it yet. But it is certainly a growth engine for us in Europe to help companies around the world manage their carbon output through high-quality industrial carbon removals, and we're also moving into nature-based car removals. So that's an area as an operator, we're really engaged in. And then we also, of course, can provide the same technology we're using for our markets to open up those opportunities for other markets, and we are engaged with other clients, some of our tech clients on their ambitions to launch these carbon offset markets. So I think you'll see more of that over time. We just -- it's very early days, though.  All right. Well, I want to say I think that's all the questions. So thank you very much for your time today. And in closing, Nasdaq's first quarter results demonstrate how we're off to a strong start in 2022, and I look forward to our continued discussions throughout the year regarding our progress. So thank you very much, and have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted.  Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter 2022 performance beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation.  The 5% increase in reported net revenue of $892 million is the net result of organic growth of 6%, including a 13% organic increase in the Solutions segment, partially offset by a 4% organic decrease in Market Services compared to a record net revenue high in the first quarter of 2021, and the contribution from Verafin as well as impact from divestitures, partially offset by the negative impact from changes in FX rates.  Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% decreased 2 percentage points compared to the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $329 million or $1.97 per diluted share, compared to $327 million or $1.96 per diluted share in the prior year period.  Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $1.19 billion, an increase of 9% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $655 million, an increase of 12%. I will now review quarterly segment results on Slides 13 through 16.  Starting with Market Technology, revenue increased $24 million or 24%. The increase primarily reflects a positive $18 million impact from the acquisition of Verafin, which occurred near the middle of the first quarter of 2021, and $9 million in organic revenue growth, led by our anti-financial crime technology business.  ARR for Market Technology totaled $435 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The Market Technology segment operating margin was 3% in the period, well below our objectives. Focusing on the Market Infrastructure Technology business, results continue to reflect the headwinds from logistical challenges the pandemic presented as well as some specific client delivery challenges in the post-trade space.  Investment Intelligence revenue increased $28 million or 11%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $30 million. Organic revenue growth during the period primarily reflects strong growth in our index and analytics businesses as well as a positive contribution from Market Data.  ARR was $570 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. AUM ETPs licensed to Nasdaq indices increased 4% compared to the prior year period to $401 million. The Investment Intelligence segment operating margin of 65% is unchanged from the prior year period.  Corporate Platforms revenues increased $22 million or 15%, including 17% organic growth. The increase was primarily driven by higher U.S. listings revenues due to the 17% expansion in our listed U.S. corporate issuer base as well as higher adoption across the breadth of Investor Relations, and newer ESG advisory and reporting offerings.  Corporate Platforms ARR was $576 million and increased 18% compared to the prior year period. The Corporate Platform segment operating margin of 45% increased 5 percentage points compared to the prior year period and was primarily driven by growth in the listed issuer base. Market Services net revenues decreased $19 million or 6%. The organic revenue decrease was $13 million or 4%, and there was a $6 million negative impact from changes in FX rates.  The organic decrease primarily reflects lower U.S. equities industry trading volumes compared to the record first quarter 2021 period as well as lower capture in U.S. equities. The segment operating margin of 63% decreased 5 percentage points compared to the very strong prior year period given the lower trading net revenues and the impact of higher professional fees.  Turning to Page 17 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $35 million to $428 million. The increase reflects a $36 million or 9% organic increase and a $9 million increase from the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by a $10 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates.  The organic expense increase is driven by higher compensation and benefits expense, reflecting our continued investment in new employees to drive growth. Inflationary pressures on compensation and performance-linked compensation, which continues to reflect the very strong growth across our solutions segment.  We intend to continue investing thoughtfully to maximize the benefits of our expanded customer base and the increasing breadth of capabilities we have developed to expand each relationship. We are revising our 2022 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.7 billion to $1.76 billion, essentially lifting the bottom end of the existing range a bit to account for the very strong organic growth in the Solutions segment businesses to start the year.  Turning to Slide 19. Debt increased by $68 million versus 4Q '21, primarily due to issuance -- the issuance of $550 million of new 3.95% senior unsecured notes due March 2052, partially offset by a net payment of $420 million of commercial paper and a $55 million decrease in eurobond book values caused by a weaker euro.  Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 3.1x, unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2021. In April, we used proceeds from the notes offering completed in the first quarter to retire $500 million of bonds maturing in June of 2024. Now let me take a moment to update you on the dividend stock repurchases and our intention to split our stock.  During the first quarter of '22, the company repurchased $467 million in shares, including $325 million related to the previously disclosed accelerated share repurchase program discussed on the 4Q call. Additionally, we are announcing today an 11% increase in the dividend to $0.60 per share.  The company has also began the process of obtaining certain shareholder and SEC approvals to facilitate a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend. If such approvals are received, we expect the split to be completed in the third quarter of 2022.  In closing, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. We delivered record quarterly revenues, 13% organic revenue growth in the Solutions segment and a 52% non-GAAP operating margin, what we see as an incredibly strong start to 2022 that we can build upon moving forward.  So thank you for your time, and I'll turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure. So Craig, on your question about how much. So we don't give specificity at that level. But what I can say is if you look at the index business holistically, about 2/3 of that is asset based and the other 1/3 is the futures, plus some index data.  And just on your question related to the accelerator. So I think we've talked about this coming out of the fourth quarter. In our contract, we have an accelerator that kicks in when we hit certain levels during the year. For the past 2 years, that's happened sort of midyear, end of June-ish. And so we did see a drop. And I think the number we shared coming out of fourth quarter was in reduction related to the accelerator coming off in the first quarter. And then assuming volumes stay at the same level as they were last year, we'd see that sort of pop up towards the middle of the year. Sure. So when we look at -- you look at AFC in total, that includes both Verafin and our trade and market surveillance businesses, the organic growth there was 31%. If you sort of adjust that for the deferred revenue write-down, the organic growth versus last year first quarter was 17%. So it's a very healthy combined numbers in that business. So Dan, I think it's fairly straightforward. You can think about it. We talk about our medium-term outlook for the Solutions segment in the aggregate as being at 6% to 9% growth. And so this quarter, collectively, we put up 13% organic growth, so well above that 6% to 9%. And so that's how we think about it."

After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, SVP, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team.

Your conference call will resume shortly. Please remain on the line. Your conference call will resume shortly.\nAdena Friedman: An improving business environment for Nasdaq in 2024. We have a healthy pipeline of companies that have filed to go public on Nasdaq. Additionally, throughout 2023, we benefited from $31 billion in net inflows into our Index products, which represents a strong starting point for 2024. In the fourth quarter, we also saw early signs of normalization in sales cycles for our IR and asset-owner solutions. And lastly, market volumes are off to a solid start in the New Year and client interests in our comprehensive suite of technology solutions remains very strong. Turning now to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq crossed the $1 billion mark in net revenues for the first time in a single quarter, achieving revenues of $1.1 billion. This is a 23% increase compared to the prior year period and a 7% increase on an organic basis. We delivered 9% organic growth across our solutions businesses during the quarter where market services was flat. For the full year, net revenues of $3.9 billion increased 9% from 2022 or 5% on an organic basis. Solutions generated 7% organic -- annual organic revenue growth, which is consistent with our overall solutions revenue outlook, despite a dynamic market environment. Our market services revenue were flat year-over-year, primarily due to continued muted volumes in Europe on the back of strong performance in 2022. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2.6 billion, an organic increase of 6% year-over-year. This slower IPO environment as well as lower buying activity by corporates for our IR solutions contributed to a more modest growth in ARR in 2023. Annualized SaaS revenues increased to $910 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding Adenza, this represented a 12% growth rate and 38% of total company ARR. Across the company, we accomplished revenue growth and business expansion while maintaining our operating margin at 52% for both the quarter and the full year basis, excluding Adenza. Our strong performance in 2023, illustrates the strength of our diversified business and ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives in an unpredictable environment. We did this while taking an important strategic step in Nasdaq's evolution. On November 1, we were pleased to complete the Adenza acquisition and we are now working as one team to further our clients' goals for risk management and regulatory reporting excellence. Reflecting on the past year, I'm extremely proud of Nasdaq's team's accomplishments. With the establishment of our divisional structure and the Adenza acquisition, 2023 was a transformational year for our business. Throughout the year, we achieved several major milestones to deepen our client relationships and advance to our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. Now let's review the highlights of our operating -- operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. As you know, at Nasdaq, our exchanges are our foundation. We maintained our position as the premier US exchange for IPOs with an 81% US operating company win rate in 2023. In total, we welcomed 103 operating company IPOs that raised more than $11 billion in proceeds, marking Nasdaq's fifth consecutive year as the leading US listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised. In addition, 18 companies representing $377 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the year. In Index, we had $31 billion of net inflows for the year, including $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Our clients want -- our clients launched 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices during the year, bringing to market robust solutions in line with investor demand. Beyond our exchange and Index leadership, we are a leading source of institutional intelligence to the buy side through investments and have continued to expand our offering into alternatives in ESG. We continue to broaden our ESG Solutions in 2023, launching multiple new offerings to help corporates and investors navigate an evolving ESG ecosystem, including Nasdaq Metrio and eVestment ESG Analytics. We also introduced a suite of new solutions designed to help corporate clients drive governance excellence and accelerate their ESG strategies, including Sustainable Lens through IR Insight. Turning to the FinTech division. With the completion of our Adenza acquisition, we have created a financial technology powerhouse of Anti-Financial Crime, Surveillance, Market Technology, and Risk and Regulatory reporting solutions that positions us as a key risk management partner to the global financial system. Our Calypso solution helps financial institutions navigate a range of market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real time risk management decision-making. Similarly, in an increasingly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment where risks need to be managed in shorter timelines at a granular level, our AxiomSL solution enables our clients to benefit from the Nasdaq's global scale and expertise. We now can be a comprehensive partner to banks, brokers, financial market infrastructure providers, and investment managers worldwide by helping them maximize their liquidity through world class capital markets in risk management technology, as well as by enhancing integrity across the banking system through our regulatory reporting and Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions. With the closing of Adenza, we're fully focused on engaging with our clients and new employees to ensure a smooth and successful transition and integration. Tal Cohen, Nasdaq's Co-President and Leader of the FinTech division and I have personally been speaking with our clients over the past few months and there is a lot of excitement around the potential opportunities now that Adenza is part of Nasdaq. Adenza finished the year with strong sales and upsells across its solutions. Specifically, in the last two months, we signed six new clients, including two central banks. We also expanded our relationships with 35 existing clients. For the full year, Adenza added 23 new clients and expanded our relationships with 142 existing clients, including three cross-sells. We are thrilled to enter 2024 with Adenza as part of Nasdaq and we're very excited to drive the business and the solutions to new heights in the years ahead. Turning to market technology. In 2023, we bolstered our global client footprint with the addition of seven clients, including four in the fourth quarter. We also expanded our relationships with four clients in the fourth quarter and more than 10 clients for the full year. Importantly, we had key technology client signings in APAC and in the LATAM regions. We are proud to forge new technology partnership with nuam exchange, which is the consolidation of marketplaces across Peru, Chile, and Colombia. We also expanded our relationship with Chile's central securities depository with capabilities to manage digitized assets and with B3 in Brazil to develop a new clearing solution, and with BMV in Mexico to modernize this entire post-trade technology platform. Our growing customer relationship highlights the importance of the Financial Technology we provide, which powers resilient and liquid markets around the world. In our Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions, we're bringing world-leading technology coupled with our consortium dataset from 2,500 banks that fights the growing threat of financial crime in the global financial system. Our inaugural Global Financial Crime Report which was conducted in partnership with outside experts, estimates that over $3 trillion of illicit funds flow through the global financial system and $500 billion is lost abroad. It's an enormous challenge that requires collective action across the banking sector, the public sector and the embrace of advanced technology. We are very proud of our role in fighting financial crime, and we're finding tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities across the banking sector. In 2023, we reached a significant milestone in our Anti-Financial Crime growth strategy. During the year, Verafin our fraud and AML solutions signed its first three Tier 1 banks as well as four Tier 2 banks, including one Tier 1 client and one Tier 2 client in the fourth quarter. We also partnered with a growing number of small and medium-sized financial institutions for a total of 237 new clients this year and 100 for the fourth quarter alone. Additionally, we developed our first proprietary Verafin GenAI Copilot, which is now in beta with our customers. Our GenAI tools reduce time and resources spent on manual tasks and processes such as alert reviews, research and documentation. By increasing our operational efficiency, Verafin enables our clients to invest in resilient growth at an attractive ROI. In Surveillance, we signed 27 new clients in 2023, including six in the fourth quarter. We made significant strides in modernizing our solutions by launching a new cloud-based architecture and capabilities within Surveillance user interfaces. These innovations give our clients the ability to calibrate their Surveillance setup more efficiently and effectively. Today, 50% of Nasdaq Trade Surveillance clients, leverage our cloud-deployed solutions which support access to 200 sophisticated alerts across more than 160 markets globally. As we continue to enhance our surveillance capabilities, we're encouraged by the early adoption of our NextGen cloud architecture and new user interfaces. Moving onto Market Services, in the fourth quarter, we maintained our strong 72% market share for our cash equities markets in the Nordics against the challenging volume environment across the European markets. We've also continued to demonstrate a leading market position in the US equities and options markets. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust closing cross volumes from the S&P, MSCI and our own Nasdaq rebalance events and we continue to experience growth -- growing adoption of our NDX Index Options product. Additionally, we continue to advance the modernization of markets with the successful migration of our second half US options market to the AWS cloud infrastructure and with the SEC approval of the first AI-powered order type called Dynamic M-ELO, which we expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024. Altogether, we're moving with speed while delivering revenue growth at an attractive margin profile that will drive shareholder value. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2024. Our first priority is to continue the successful integration of Adenza. We've made great progress in the initial phase of the integration and remain confident in our ability to deliver on the goals that we laid out at the time of the deal. Second, we're accelerating the impact of our divisional structure to activate and unlock new opportunities that will drive our business into the future. Over the past year, we have delivered significant progress across each of our business divisions and we will continue to realize the benefits of this structure in 2024. Third, we are institutionalizing client listening across the company to unlock revenue growth through a One Nasdaq approach to our client engagements. In 2024, we have a focused program to organize our client data, advance our CRM and other related systems, and enhance our processes across the enterprise to gain a holistic understanding of our clients with a goal to drive partnerships in cross-selling opportunities going forward. And fourth, we will further amplify the impact that AI has on the business and in our products. Nasdaq is leveraging several critical components to ensure AI is implemented safely, securely and fairly. And through our focus on AI, coupled with the vast proprietary data sets that we've created over decades in our markets and in our solutions covering investment analytics, investor relations and Anti-Financial Crime, we're confident that we can extend Nasdaq's competitive advantage in the years ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities at Investor Day and in the quarters to come. To wrap up, 2023 was another year defined by significant strategic and operational milestones and strong execution. As we look ahead to 2024, we're well-positioned to better serve our clients more holistically as we become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review our financial details.\nSarah Youngwood: Thank you, Adena, and good morning everyone. I am thrilled to be here for my first earnings call at Nasdaq. I could not be more excited to join the firm at such a transformational time and I look forward to seeing many of you at Investor Day. Now, I will turn to our financial results. My commentary will be focused on non-GAAP results and year-on-year growth rate will be provided on an organic basis. Similarly, operating margins will be discussed ex-Adenza for comparability purposes. I will discuss Adenza's [generic] (ph) results at the end of the fintech section. Before we move to the quarter, I would like to give you the highlights for the full year 2023 starting on Slide 12 of the earnings presentation. In an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation. Revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5%, with solutions revenue of $2.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP expense was $1.8 billion, up 5%, in line with guidance for a 52% operating margin, which was flat versus the prior year. This resulted in diluted EPS of $2.82, reflecting organic growth of 6%. We had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, a growth rate of 11%. Moving on to the fourth quarter on Slide 13. We reported revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $860 million, an increase of 9%. Non-GAAP expense was $504 million, up 2%, and with an operating margin of 52%, up 3 percentage points. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.72, reflecting organic growth of 11%. Turning to Slide 14. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 6% organically. The annualized SaaS revenue totaled $910 million, representing organic growth of 12%. Excluding Adenza, SaaS was 38% of ARR, an improvement of 2 percentage points. Including Adenza, that number is 35%, which will improve as the cloud portion of their revenue increases. As a reminder, we only consider the cloud portion of their revenue to be SaaS. Let's review division results for the quarter starting on Slide 15. For capital access platforms, revenue of $461 million increased 10%, driven by excellent performance in Index. In Data and Listing Services, we saw 3% growth. In data, we have seen a continued increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. In listings, the positive impact of pricing was partially offset by the combined impact of de-listings, a muted IPO environment and the rollup of prior year's initial listings revenue. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 3%. Analytics delivered high single digit growth, reflecting our ability to monetize the value of our data to the buy side with new business and increased pricing across traditional and alternative asset managers. The strength in analytics was partially offset by a weaker capital raising markets and the impact of elongated sales cycle in corporate solutions. Index revenue increased 26% and overall AUM grew by 34%. Over the last 12 months, our net inflows were $31 billion, $10 billion of which occurred during the fourth quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased as well, driven by higher capture partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. As a reminder, our capture increases once we cross a volume threshold and then resets at the beginning of each year. While smaller in size, Index revenue also benefited from index data revenue growth. ARR for capital access platforms was $1.2 billion, up 3%. ARR growth was largely driven by analytics and to a lesser extent, data and listings. The muted IPO environment impacted ARR growth. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a recovery in IPOs combined with more normalized sales cycles as we progress through 2024. As a reminder, substantially all our Index revenue is excluded from ARR. The division's operating margin was 54% for the quarter, an increase of 4 percentage points due to higher revenues. For the full year, it was 55%, up roughly by 50 basis points. The increase was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by inflation, revenue-related expense, and investments in particular across data and Index. Moving to financial technology on Slide 16. The division delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 8%. Regulatory technology grew 17% with Verafin at 25%. Verafin added 100 new clients this quarter, including our Tier -- third Tier 1 bank. While we are excited about these additions, as we have previously discussed, the contracting and implementation with these larger, more complex institutions is longer. We will start recognizing subscription revenue in 2024 but we believe that the effect will only accelerate as we expand relationships with these clients. The strong performance of Verafin along with 6% growth in Surveillance led to the 17% growth of regulatory technology. For Surveillance, the fourth quarter growth was impacted by the timing of bookings in 2023 versus 2022, but fundamentals remained strong for the year with six new clients in the fourth quarter and 27 for the full year. We also made inroads with the Tier 3 broker client cohort, which reflects progress beyond our leadership position with large banks. Cloud for trade Surveillance is now above 50% deployment, which is an important driver of client stickiness through the speed and efficiency it enables us to provide. Moving on to Capital Markets Technology, we saw 3% growth driven by data center connectivity demand. We had new market tech contract signings in Latin America and with one of our US Tier 1 clients. We expect these contracts to start to accrue in 2024. As Adena mentioned, we continue to increase our market technology presence in Latin America and to have a leading role in the modernization of markets in the region. ARR for FinTech totaled $1.35 billion, an increase of 10% due to continued customer wins at Verafin as well as growth in Trade Management Services and Market Technology. The division's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 40%, up 4 percentage points. The organic margin expansion reflects solid top line growth and expense control with an overall increase in revenue-related costs, offset by efficiencies and lower professional fees. We are progressing on our journey to improve the efficiencies in Market Technology while continuing to support the growth of Verafin and Surveillance. For the full year, the operating margin was 40%, up 5 percentage points with a story which mirrors that of the quarter, including strong operating leverage and investments. Before closing on FinTech, a few additional words on Adenza. For November and December, Adenza contributed [$149] (ph) million in revenue, $458 million of ARR of which $98 million was in SaaS, and $35 million in non-GAAP operating expense. A strong finish to the year drove a 77% operating margin for our two month ownership. On a full year basis, Adenza had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59%, ahead of our initial 58% outlook for the year. Let me now talk about Adenza's full year revenue and ARR. Revenue was $583 million in 2023, up 14%. ARR of $458 million with 16%, excluding a significant bankruptcy that occurred during the year or 14% net of it. Both metrics are on a constant currency basis. We had nearly 50% of new ACV coming from cloud this year. The strong cloud take-up by our clients supports our growth and efficiencies. Revenue growth benefited from a large portion of ARR up for renewal in the quarter and in the year. Going forward, we expect Adenza's revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the medium to long term outlook we provided when we announced the acquisition. The timing of contracts being up for renewal and the mix of revenue between cloud and on-premise delivery will have an impact on revenue growth in any given quarter and year. This is why we are focused on ARR growth, which is not as impacted by annual renewable and delivery method. We'll provide more details on the revenue dynamics of our FinTech division at Investor Day. And wrapping up our divisional overview with Market Services. Net revenue was $247 million for the quarter, roughly flat with growth in US cash equities offset by decreases in US options. US cash equities growth was driven by higher capture, partially offset by lower share. In a very competitive US options environment, we are defending our strong market share lead and our attractive capture. Meanwhile, in Europe, tepid exchange volumes were positively offset by a $7 million nonrecurring payment and by the benefits of diversification between fixed income and equity. The investments we have made in leveraging our technology and data to provide our European market clients with transparency helps them to generate [indiscernible]. This has enabled us to help our clients improve their execution quality and has been key to our ability to reclaim our 72% market share, a 2 percentage point increase. The division's operating margin was 57% in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to 60% in the prior year quarter as a result of higher compensation costs as we continue to invest in our people and higher technology costs due to ongoing investments related to both capacity and migrating US market to the cloud. The full year operating margin for the division totaled 59% with the same drivers as recorded history. Turning to Slide 19. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $504 million, an organic increase of $8 million or 2% versus our organic revenue growth of 7%. I went through the story in the businesses, and it reflects good expense discipline as well as the timing of marketing and professional fees. Overall, this reflects a 52% operating margin, up 3 percentage points. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating expense was $1.83 billion, in line with guidance. We were up 5% consistent with revenue growth for a flat operating margin at 52%. The increase is due to investments in key growth areas, inflation and higher revenue-related expense. We also achieved efficiencies during the year as we continue to optimize our location footprint and bring the divisions together as part of our divisional realignment. If you include Adenza for the full year, operating expense totaled $2.05 billion. Now on to guidance. We are initiating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $2.105 billion to $2.185 billion, the midpoint of which reflects pro forma growth of 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza and the in-year expense benefit of net synergies. On an organic basis, excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth will be just under 4.5%. We will spend more time on synergies at Investor Day, but we reiterate the net $80 million synergy target by the end of 2025 and $80 million cost to achieve are set forth in the restructuring program we just initiated. Additionally, we are guiding the full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly higher than 2023, due to lower expected tax benefit on equity awards. Turning to Slide 20. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. For the year, we had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, and Adenza had $306 million in unlevered pretax free cash flow. Our gross leverage ratio was expected to be at 4.7 times at the time of deal close but we are pleased to share that at year-end, we are at 4.3 times despite 0.1 times headwind from euro strength. Let's go through the details on the chart. At the end of the third quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was 2.4 times. We added the leverage to acquire Adenza. At the beginning of December, we posted share repurchases and repaid $260 million of term loans. The ratio benefited from the incremental EBITDA from Adenza's full year and net tax growth. We expect to continue deleveraging in the first quarter of 2024. And to wrap up on free cash flow utilization, we have repurchased $269 million of our common stock this year, including $110 million in the fourth quarter. And we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a 35% annualized payout ratio. In closing today, this quarter and this year's performance shows Nasdaq's ability to deliver consistent growth, margin and free cash flow in a range of environments. We are committed to disciplined execution and continued innovation. The investment we have made in our resilience, our technology and our data over the years, coupled with our reach and track record, position us for sustainable growth as we power our client's success. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I know Sarah mentioned that as you may talk about that during Investor Day, but could you please add more color on the initial progress of integrating Adenza and achieving revenue and cost synergies? Thanks.\nSarah Youngwood: Sure. Hey, Owen. Yeah. So we -- as you said, we closed on November 1. We immediately created the operating model on a go-forward basis, meaning we combined the teams. We have a leader structure now that is a combination of Adenza and Nasdaq personnel under Tal. And we've been working very hard to make sure that we bring the sales organizations together, the client delivery success, the operating teams as well as the technology teams together. And so, Owen, I think it's only a couple of months in, but we are definitely operating as one team. We have been -- we have a very specific and defined synergy plan. We have a very clear line of sight as to how we're going to achieve that plan. We will provide more details on that. But I would say, Owen, that across all of Nasdaq, we have a combination of efforts to make sure that we create efficiencies within the team just as a normal acquisition, integration would occur, but then also a locational strategy that allows us to align ourselves with our clients going forward and leverage the strengths that Adenza has in some very critical centers of excellence around the world. So we do have, I think, a good plan. We will provide more details at Investor Day. And then the last thing I would say on revenue synergies, it's obviously very early days, and it takes time to sign new deals. It takes time to develop those relationships. But the early conversations that I've had and that Tal and Valerie, who's the Chief Revenue Officer, have had has been extremely encouraging. People really want to partner with us. They see us now as a partner to help them solve their largest problems. That's across reg tech, that's across anti-fin crime and risk management. I think they understand that we understand them. We are regulated. We have great relationships with the regulators. I mean, they also understand we can bring a lot of advanced technology in and advanced cloud capabilities within Adenza. So I have to tell you that the early conversations are really great. But as we've said all along, it will take time for those revenue synergies to actually show up in the financials. And again, we'll provide you more color on that at Investor Day.\nOwen Lau: Got it. So on Verafin, you published a report, you talked about the amount of fraud and also potential opportunity. Can you talk about the strategy for you in 2024 for Verafin? Which area do you think you can win more Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients? Is it more on the payment side or in other areas? Thanks a lot.\nSarah Youngwood: Yeah, sure. Yeah, thanks for pointing that out, Owen. We did create a study that -- we're working with two outside parties. So it was both outside parties and us. We interviewed a lot of the key personnel within banks that are responsible for anti-fin crime to understand, number one, how big is the problem. $3 trillion of money laundered through the system, $0.5 trillion lost to fraud. And then how big is the problem in terms of actually having to solve it? And what are the challenges? One is that different criminal actors act differently. So you have to really have different typologies of analytics to try to root out different criminal behaviors, number one. Number two, obviously, we've always said criminals, they don't just bank in one bank. So a single bank cannot look at all their transaction data and actually solve the problem. So Verafin is really a truly unique solution because we do have 2,500 banks that represent $6 trillion of assets, all within a consortium data link that allow us to find very defined topologies and really root out more criminal behavior. So we're seeing fewer false positives, more fraud found, more AML found, and we're able to prove that out, and that's why we've been able to sign up the Tier 1s and Tier 2s with another Tier 1 signed in the fourth quarter. Where we've been focusing? I would say, a couple of things, Owen. One is on continuing to kind of have that flywheel on the SMBs. And in that particular case, we're really focused on moving to real-time payments and making sure that the small to medium banks have world-class AFC around their real-time payments. And so that's a big growth area for us in '24. In the larger banks, we've been -- definitely the easiest ROI to show is fraud. So payment like wire fraud, ACH fraud, check fraud, all of the payments fraud we're finding is a huge benefit and very clear ROI. AML is a harder problem to solve, but we actually had signed one of the large Tier 2s, I think actually two of the large Tier 2s is really focused on AML. And as we solve the fraud problem, what we're also finding is as soon as we go into these large banks, we show them our benefit on fraud. They're already starting talk to us on AML. So that's the land and expand opportunity that we have. And we definitely see expansion opportunities in '24 with the banks you've already signed. And then the last thing I would say is that we also are really focused now in the UK. And in fact, Brendan is meeting with banks this week to really understand and look at our -- particularly our payments fraud capabilities in the UK. The laws are changing to allow for more data sharing, and that will make it so that our pooling is much more effective in supporting their problem and making it so that we can provide a solution there. So that's our next leg of growth as we go through '24 into '25.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi, good morning, Adena and Sarah. Thanks for taking my question. My question, I just wanted to touch on Adenza here. You talked about ARR growth [that can fall in] (ph) the mid-teens, and you've clearly discussed your medium-term ambitions there. But just given the kind of somewhat lengthy sales cycle there, I mean, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about any expectations for Adenza revenue growth this year, maybe in the context of your long-term targets? And then also any color you can provide between Axiom and Calypso would be helpful.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yeah. I would just say on an ARR growth perspective, we did provide you kind of that mid-teens view of ARR growth and we continue to see the business dynamics supporting that. And so we would expect that, that medium-term outlook for Adenza will continue to support that mid-teens growth. I think that as we know, revenue growth is -- also is impacted by timing of bookings, timing of renewals there and whether or not it's on-prem or cloud. So we're going to actually unpack that at Investor Day to help you understand how do you turn ARR into revenue, how do revenue dynamics change and recognizing there would be more quarterly shift in revenues. But the general view is that, that ARR growth is definitely the fundamental thing to look at in terms of how you evaluate the growth and progress of Adenza or Calypso and Axiom. And at the same time, we do want you to understand how the revenue dynamics work. The more we sign cloud, the more the contracts become ratable over the life of the contract. And whereas in on-prem deals, we recognize half the license fees upfront upon signing. So there's a lot to unpack there. But we feel great about the overall demand drivers. The other thing to think about with Axiom and Calypso is that timing of renewals also can have an impact in revenue recognition. But again, we're seeing really strong demand cycles for both Axiom and Calypso, so we feel very good about that, whereas timing of revenue might be a little different from one to another just based on when the renewal cycles hit in that kind of given year. So that's definitely -- again, we'll go through it. I would say the foundation is very strong and remains consistent with what we expected.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Was hoping to expand upon that a little bit and maybe incorporate pricing in terms of what pricing contributed to revenue growth and/or ARR growth in 2023 and how you think about that for the Adenza business prospectively?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. So actually, I mean, we're not going to get very specific on that particular year. But as a general dynamic, when we look at ARR growth, we basically attribute about half the ARR growth to upsells actually. And we upsold a lot of clients and I can\u2019t remember the exact number, but we upsold over 100, almost 150 clients, I think or 120 clients in 2023. And then the other half comes from a combination of pricing increases and new bookings. We don't break that out in terms of that half. But I would just say it is a combination of both. And the way that it works is, obviously, we add a lot of value across the products as we go through the year. And so as we go into both annualized increases that are contractually stated but also renewal cycles, we definitely show that the value of what we're providing to them corresponds with an increase and/or their assets are increasing. And therefore, they're using this across a larger part of their business and that also warrants an increase. But those are -- that dynamic is consistent.\nDan Fannon: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, based on, I think, some of the factors that were mentioned for listings, revenue in fourth quarter, as you think about the first half of this year and/or the full year with the roll-off of initial fees from prior years plus a hopeful recovery and new listings, how should we think about the revenue dynamics here in 2024?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, sure. Well, just by the way, just to be very precise, we had 142 upsells, including three cross-sells in Adenza in 2023. I just wanted to make sure we get the facts out there. But in terms of the listings dynamics, it definitely has been a more challenging environment listings. And as you know, as you point out, the amortization of the initial listing fees is an important dynamic within the listings revenues. It benefits -- it means when we have a really strong year of listings, like we had in 2020 and 2021, we don't recognize all the initial listing fees that year, it kind of gives us a lift in the following years because those fees are amortized over two to four years, depending on the size of the listing. But then it means that when we have two more challenging years, it takes time for that to also filter through. And so we will have kind of residual impact of these lower years in 2024 and 2025 as the initial listing fees from the higher years roll off and we don't have, as you've noticed, kind of a net reduction in listings in 2023. So we would expect that 2024 will be a challenging year for listings. Within the data and listings business, though, we basically are saying that it's a low to mid-single digit grower, and we would anticipate that we can still achieve that, even with the more muted listing revenue that we would expect in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. I mean, maybe first question on sales cycles. You noted that you saw early signs of normalization of sales cycles for your IR and asset owner solutions. Can you speak a bit more about those early signs and give some examples? And in terms of what that means for revenue growth, should we think about the Workflow & Insights organic growth potentially being near a floor type level at 5% organic in the fourth quarter and gradually improving from here or any other commentary you could provide in terms of the timing and what that improvement means around the sales cycles?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So all of the solutions within Workflow & Insights are SaaS solutions. So how you end the year really determines a lot about the following year. And so we definitely saw a more challenging environment with corporates last year. The listing environment was more muted, but also they were just not as focused on investing across IR in a more challenging market backdrop. That improved in the fourth quarter. And so we did start to have a more, I would say, more normalized environment for conversations and signings of corporate clients for our IR solutions in the fourth quarter, but it was against the backdrop of a harder year overall. So it will take time for that improved environment to actually flow through and show up in the actual SaaS revenues because we obviously have to continue to see that and it will kind of build on itself. But I would expect that 2024 will continue to kind of have some overhang from the weaker environment in \u201823, even with a more normalized sales environment. With analytics, it's actually what's interesting, our overall analytics growth was quite strong in the fourth quarter at 9%. And I think that, that really reflects demand for our data across the buy side and the analytic solutions we have that serve the buy side. But our asset owner solutions, this is a very specific software capability that we offer to endowments and pensions and others. That actually did have an uptick in demand and signing in the fourth quarter, but it was an overall difficult year. So that again, I think will create a headwind as we go through 2024 with the hope that we can start to show some pick-up as we go through the year.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And maybe a follow up on Adenza. You mentioned the strong cloud uptake. I guess I'm not trying to front run the Investor Day, but can you just remind us what the cloud adoption will mean with respect to EBITDA margins over the long term, at least directionally? And given the length of these contracts and given the level of uptake in cloud that you're seeing on renewals, is there a rough timeframe as to how quickly that cloud migration might happen over the next few years?\nAdena Friedman: I would say we will provide at least more color on that in Investor Day. But if we think about it, I think, Sarah, it's like 14% of overall revenue?\nSarah Youngwood: 14% of revenue is currently cloud and [50%] (ph) of new ACV bookings.\nAdena Friedman: And then in ARR, it's 21%?\nSarah Youngwood: 21%.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, 21% of ARR is cloud. So we have a lot of runway here. So as we renew clients, moving them into the cloud modules, as we sign new clients, sign them for new modules. But recognizing that we can sign a client just on a new module in cloud, like it doesn't have to be that they're signing for Calypso and they're adding new functionality, just that new functionality we can deliver in cloud. That's how flexible the platform is. They don't have to kind of redo the whole platform implementation on cloud. But that also means that as we work with clients on renewals and changes, is they're going to have different timelines for how they want to bring that cloud capabilities in. Some banks are marching very fast into cloud and they have like actually top down mandates to move to cloud and that can obviously be a huge catalyst for us. But other banks are marching quite slowly towards it. So we want to be flexible. We expect this to be, as we said, very much a multi-year transition, going from 21% of ARR and growing and growing. But I have to say, it will be a slow moving train. In terms of the economics, it is both an opportunity for us to be a true managed service provider, which gives us more revenue opportunity, and also provide it with a very nice margin for both them and us. So that's an opportunity for uplift, but again, a slow moving train. So we'll want to make sure that we give you a little more color on that at Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: Yeah, good morning everyone. I was wondering if you could help us think about the contract value from client wins at Adenza. Maybe any color just in terms of how much a new client -- [you had six this quarter would] (ph) translate from a new contract perspective and we expand relationships with existing clients, we're talking about a 10% increase, 15% increase? Any color that would be helpful.\nAdena Friedman: Well, we don't actually provide specific contract values per client or anything like that. If you don't mind, I think we'll take that one back and think about how we want to provide more transparency there. But I would say this, it's always land and expand. And actually as we move up into Tier 2s and Tier 1s [on ASCs] (ph), it's land and expand. So we might sign a client for, let's say mid to high six figures or low seven figures to land. And then as we expand, we can go and we can double or triple, or even in some cases, you know, have five times the amount over time. And I do think we have some examples of that back when we first signed the deal and on our third quarter results, we gave some examples of how we've expanded contracts over time, but we're not providing you specifics on, like, what the new contract values were for the new clients right now.\nChris Allen: That was it for me. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And I show our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on the retention ratios for Adenza. It looked like, for the full year, they -- on both the gross and net basis, came in a little bit lower than what you were expecting when you initially announced the deal, even after you include the impact of those bankruptcies. So just was hoping maybe you could provide some more color on what you think led to that underperformance there? And then any color on the retention ratios or what your targeted retention ratios would be going forward. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yeah. So I think we did see some declines in the growth and net retention in the latter part of the year. And I think really a lot of that did come from the bankruptcy that we mentioned and that really did start impacting us in the fourth quarter. And then, we had, I would just say the, what I would call the events of 2023 across the banking system did create some levels of challenge in a couple of very specific areas of retention, but it's not, I would say there was nothing systemic about the concern. There was nothing that we saw that was that was more of a trend in any way whatsoever. It was more the encapsulation of a lot of the events that occurred during the year both in terms of looking at the retention as well as kind of some of the acquisitions that occurred. But again, these are very, very specific and nothing trend-wise. But I don't know, Sarah, if you want to add anything to that.\nSarah Youngwood: Yeah, the retention on a gross basis was actually flat at 97% if you exclude that bankruptcy. So when we look at it in terms of like long-term trends, we feel that it's very solid.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah.\nPatrick Moley: Okay, great. That's it for me.\nAdena Friedman: Okay, great. Thank you.\nPatrick Moley: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask on capital allocation, how you're thinking about allocating capital now that the Adenza deal has closed? How you're thinking about the pace of debt pay down as well as buybacks? I thought I heard you mention that you paused on buybacks. Is that pause still in place and what would lead you to reinstate buybacks?\nSarah Youngwood: Hey, Mike. Nice speaking to you. This is Sarah. So what we have is the strategy that we have outlined is maintained. So we have a balanced view of how to deal with the capital allocation just to reiterate across the dividends, the share repurchase, and the deleveraging. You've seen the pause, as I mentioned, and that pause is going to be maintained in the first quarter. Very important for us to continue to deleverage, and -- but that is a short-term tactical as part of a strategy that overall hasn't changed. So we continue to be committed to the progressive dividend, and you've seen the progress there as well as over time it's important to continue to offset dilution with share repurchase. And so that's the context, and of course this is also a topic that we'll come back to at Investor Day.\nAdena Friedman: You know, one thing we're pretty good at is that, that just leaving 2023, as Sarah mentioned, we're at 4.3 times leverage. So that's ahead of what we had anticipated at the closing of the deal. And so that's actually kind of both the strength of the business, as well as some very specific tactical decisions we made to pay down the term loan as we're kind of getting started to kind of launch into 2024 with a very solid plan on deleveraging. But also the focus though will be on that balanced approach over time.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks. And just to follow up on the expense outlook. I'm sorry?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Just on the expense outlook, I was just hoping you could elaborate on the 5% pro forma growth in expenses for this year in 2024. What would drive you towards the higher end versus the lower end of the range and any moving pieces you might be able to elaborate on? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure, yeah. So I would say that, first of all, we've been really focused on making sure that we are being as efficient as possible across the business, just on a go -- on a run rate basis. That we are also though continuing to make the investments in driving our products forward, our growth forward, but also automation, on bringing more automation into the company. And at the same time, beginning the synergy achievement on the Adenza deal. And the midpoint really reflects all of that. What would drive the expenses above that would be higher growth. So if we're able to grow faster and we're able to grow more, there might be some revenue related expenses that come in in terms of just being able to achieve that revenue. But I think that it has also more to do with can we continue to actually accelerate some of our investments if we're seeing higher revenue growth throughout the year. And that's why we always give you a range of kind of the mid to long term outlook on our solutions business growth, revenue growth, and expense growth so that you can kind of understand how we calibrate it. But we do feel like it's been a good combination at the midpoint of expense discipline, Adenza synergies, but also targeted investments in our business.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead. Mr. Clinch, your line is open if you're on mute. Mr. Clinch, your line is open. Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bond: Hey, good morning. Could you update us on any new plans or strategies Nasdaq is exploring in digital assets since you've aborted custody offering? Obvious tailwinds following the spot ETF approvals and a lot of new large institutional players that you're familiar with becoming more active in the space. So how's Nasdaq positioning itself now?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so we are really proud to partner with BlackRock and Valkyrie as they brought their Bitcoin ETFs to Nasdaq. And it really does give investors an opportunity to express a view on the trend of Bitcoin without having -- in a highly regulated marketplace and without having to go and actually buy Bitcoin. So we do think it creates more accessibility for retail investors to have a position at Bitcoin. I think that in terms of the broader digital asset space though, as you know, we are a tech provider to the industry. We continue to provide technology to cryptocurrency exchanges, both trading, clearing, and as well as surveillance. And actually, as we've been working with some traditional exchanges, they want to make sure that they're kind of future proof. So for instance, with one of the CSD clients that we sold to this year, one of the key things is to make sure that they could move towards digital assets in their settlement system. And so we are, all of our technology can support digital assets in terms of trading, clearing settlement, surveillance. And that gives us a chance to work with the traditional exchanges and crypto exchanges. In terms of our specific crypto custody solution, we have built it. We are ready to provide that to exchanges and providers and custodians around the world. So that is now a technology offering that we can offer to clients around the world. But we have made a conscious choice not to launch a custody solution, being a custodian ourselves. I think that we feel that there are several out there that they're operating well, but it's also a very capital-intensive business. And our view is that we are better served being a market operator for the ETFs and other instruments like that, as well as being a technology provider to the industry.\nAndrew Bond: Thanks, Adena.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning. Thanks for squeezing me here. So just a quick follow up again on Adenza. Over the last couple of years, it sounded like they went through a pretty meaningful improvement in their technology stack, and there's probably a bit of CapEx around it. So as you move forward, do you think they're largely done? Are there still kind of things that might be on a heavier lifting side that needs to get implemented that they're not part of Nasdaq? And maybe just talk to your overall CapEx expectations for 2024.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So I would say that, we'll take Calypso and AxiomSL separately. AxiomSL did do a significant rewrite of their technology a few years ago. So we feel very good about kind of how they're positioned. But, and then Calypso actually, they are super flexible and very modular. So they kind of have this continuum of investment in Calypso. And they've been able to, because of that, they've actually been much more able to, both of them are focused on just bringing in new modules very quickly and iterating on their technology. So we feel really good about the tech foundation. And I think we said that at the time of signing. And now that we've closed on a deal, we've looked under the hood, it is a great technology and it's very modular and kind of platform-based. I think the area that we can really help focus them is on how do we really optimize the cloud implementation to make it so that it's as efficient as possible for them and their clients. And so we have a lot of expertise there. We've had a long history of cloud deployed solutions. And so we do actually think that's an area where we can help them invest to make it so that that can be even more effectively and efficiently delivered. But that's not a significant capital investment as much as that's just continuing innovation. They have been investing in R&D, so that has been a hallmark of their business. And so we are really pleased to see that. And we will continue that, but that's not something where there's a big CapEx requirement right now. We really do see it as a continuum of innovation. In terms of our CapEx across the year, I think, I don't know if they have any specific things that you want to mention there.\nSarah Youngwood: No, we don't have, like, any particular trends, so you're not going to see, like, a particular acceleration or something of note. We're continuing to invest in the business, and we'll come back and give you a lot of, like, color at Investor Day on the type of returns and the type of breakdowns of our investments. And we have very much a cash on cash view as to what it gives us and in addition to, of course, the investments that are foundational in the business.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Most of them have been asked and answered. But a couple more. One just on the Verafin. I think, Sarah, you mentioned if I heard correctly, Verafin growth in the quarter year-over-year of 25% against the legacy regulatory tech segment of 17%. And then I missed something you said about the surveillance part of that. So I just wanted to clarify, was that 25% at Verafin and there was some offset at the surveillance business? And then as you look at that legacy business going forward, do you see Verafin as sort of a core 20%-ish type of program?\nSarah Youngwood: So what I said is that, the 25% indeed is the growth for Verafin. And together with surveillance, you end up at 17%. So that's a 6% for surveillance. That is due to a timing of bookings in 2022 that had been an impact on the year-on-year growth for the fourth quarter. So it's really just timing in the prior year period.\nAdena Friedman: For surveillance.\nSarah Youngwood: For surveillance.\nAdena Friedman: I think, as you know, Brian -- as you know, Brian, we have a kind of an 18% to 23% kind of expectation across CSD. Now, as we move to reg tech and we integrate that with AxiomSL, we're going to be providing kind of a view and I think it's -- I always look at it as 10% to 14% across fintech, all told. And that will incorporate Verafin and surveillance along with market tech and the Adenza products.\nBrian Bedell: Right. Great. Thanks for that. And then just one last one on operating leverage, given your expense guidance. Just I guess the level of confidence on the operating leverage, clearly it looks like it's a good 3 percentage points or more below your [8% to 11%] (ph) solutions revenue guide, but how do you think of the Adenza revenue dynamics versus ARR at Adenza influencing that? I guess the punch line question here is, are you still managing that operating leverage against reported revenue or would you look at ARR as a better guide for that operating leverage dynamic?\nSarah Youngwood: So we continue to focus on our operating margin and to focus on having operating leverage as we invest on a GAAP basis, but we will always give you the details on the ARR basis, which is really the better economic view of what we are doing.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great, thank you. And as we enter another exciting year at Nasdaq, we remain focused on activating and unlocking new opportunities that will drive the business into the future. Before I close, I want to remind everyone, if you didn't remember already, that we have our scheduled 2024 Investor Day on for Tuesday, March 5th. We hope to see you all there, either in person or virtually, and we look forward to sharing our vision with you. Thank you for joining us and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "An improving business environment for Nasdaq in 2024. We have a healthy pipeline of companies that have filed to go public on Nasdaq. Additionally, throughout 2023, we benefited from $31 billion in net inflows into our Index products, which represents a strong starting point for 2024. In the fourth quarter, we also saw early signs of normalization in sales cycles for our IR and asset-owner solutions. And lastly, market volumes are off to a solid start in the New Year and client interests in our comprehensive suite of technology solutions remains very strong. Turning now to our financial results. In the fourth quarter, Nasdaq crossed the $1 billion mark in net revenues for the first time in a single quarter, achieving revenues of $1.1 billion. This is a 23% increase compared to the prior year period and a 7% increase on an organic basis. We delivered 9% organic growth across our solutions businesses during the quarter where market services was flat. For the full year, net revenues of $3.9 billion increased 9% from 2022 or 5% on an organic basis. Solutions generated 7% organic -- annual organic revenue growth, which is consistent with our overall solutions revenue outlook, despite a dynamic market environment. Our market services revenue were flat year-over-year, primarily due to continued muted volumes in Europe on the back of strong performance in 2022. Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, ended the year at $2.6 billion, an organic increase of 6% year-over-year. This slower IPO environment as well as lower buying activity by corporates for our IR solutions contributed to a more modest growth in ARR in 2023. Annualized SaaS revenues increased to $910 million in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding Adenza, this represented a 12% growth rate and 38% of total company ARR. Across the company, we accomplished revenue growth and business expansion while maintaining our operating margin at 52% for both the quarter and the full year basis, excluding Adenza. Our strong performance in 2023, illustrates the strength of our diversified business and ability to deliver against our longer-term objectives in an unpredictable environment. We did this while taking an important strategic step in Nasdaq's evolution. On November 1, we were pleased to complete the Adenza acquisition and we are now working as one team to further our clients' goals for risk management and regulatory reporting excellence. Reflecting on the past year, I'm extremely proud of Nasdaq's team's accomplishments. With the establishment of our divisional structure and the Adenza acquisition, 2023 was a transformational year for our business. Throughout the year, we achieved several major milestones to deepen our client relationships and advance to our vision to be the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. Now let's review the highlights of our operating -- operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. As you know, at Nasdaq, our exchanges are our foundation. We maintained our position as the premier US exchange for IPOs with an 81% US operating company win rate in 2023. In total, we welcomed 103 operating company IPOs that raised more than $11 billion in proceeds, marking Nasdaq's fifth consecutive year as the leading US listing exchange in terms of both number of IPOs and proceeds raised. In addition, 18 companies representing $377 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the year. In Index, we had $31 billion of net inflows for the year, including $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Our clients want -- our clients launched 83 new products linked to Nasdaq indices during the year, bringing to market robust solutions in line with investor demand. Beyond our exchange and Index leadership, we are a leading source of institutional intelligence to the buy side through investments and have continued to expand our offering into alternatives in ESG. We continue to broaden our ESG Solutions in 2023, launching multiple new offerings to help corporates and investors navigate an evolving ESG ecosystem, including Nasdaq Metrio and eVestment ESG Analytics. We also introduced a suite of new solutions designed to help corporate clients drive governance excellence and accelerate their ESG strategies, including Sustainable Lens through IR Insight. Turning to the FinTech division. With the completion of our Adenza acquisition, we have created a financial technology powerhouse of Anti-Financial Crime, Surveillance, Market Technology, and Risk and Regulatory reporting solutions that positions us as a key risk management partner to the global financial system. Our Calypso solution helps financial institutions navigate a range of market conditions, providing a live view of risk across proprietary and client trading portfolios with detailed analytics to support real time risk management decision-making. Similarly, in an increasingly complex and fragmented global regulatory environment where risks need to be managed in shorter timelines at a granular level, our AxiomSL solution enables our clients to benefit from the Nasdaq's global scale and expertise. We now can be a comprehensive partner to banks, brokers, financial market infrastructure providers, and investment managers worldwide by helping them maximize their liquidity through world class capital markets in risk management technology, as well as by enhancing integrity across the banking system through our regulatory reporting and Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions. With the closing of Adenza, we're fully focused on engaging with our clients and new employees to ensure a smooth and successful transition and integration. Tal Cohen, Nasdaq's Co-President and Leader of the FinTech division and I have personally been speaking with our clients over the past few months and there is a lot of excitement around the potential opportunities now that Adenza is part of Nasdaq. Adenza finished the year with strong sales and upsells across its solutions. Specifically, in the last two months, we signed six new clients, including two central banks. We also expanded our relationships with 35 existing clients. For the full year, Adenza added 23 new clients and expanded our relationships with 142 existing clients, including three cross-sells. We are thrilled to enter 2024 with Adenza as part of Nasdaq and we're very excited to drive the business and the solutions to new heights in the years ahead. Turning to market technology. In 2023, we bolstered our global client footprint with the addition of seven clients, including four in the fourth quarter. We also expanded our relationships with four clients in the fourth quarter and more than 10 clients for the full year. Importantly, we had key technology client signings in APAC and in the LATAM regions. We are proud to forge new technology partnership with nuam exchange, which is the consolidation of marketplaces across Peru, Chile, and Colombia. We also expanded our relationship with Chile's central securities depository with capabilities to manage digitized assets and with B3 in Brazil to develop a new clearing solution, and with BMV in Mexico to modernize this entire post-trade technology platform. Our growing customer relationship highlights the importance of the Financial Technology we provide, which powers resilient and liquid markets around the world. In our Anti-Financial Crime suite of solutions, we're bringing world-leading technology coupled with our consortium dataset from 2,500 banks that fights the growing threat of financial crime in the global financial system. Our inaugural Global Financial Crime Report which was conducted in partnership with outside experts, estimates that over $3 trillion of illicit funds flow through the global financial system and $500 billion is lost abroad. It's an enormous challenge that requires collective action across the banking sector, the public sector and the embrace of advanced technology. We are very proud of our role in fighting financial crime, and we're finding tremendous opportunity to continue to expand our capabilities across the banking sector. In 2023, we reached a significant milestone in our Anti-Financial Crime growth strategy. During the year, Verafin our fraud and AML solutions signed its first three Tier 1 banks as well as four Tier 2 banks, including one Tier 1 client and one Tier 2 client in the fourth quarter. We also partnered with a growing number of small and medium-sized financial institutions for a total of 237 new clients this year and 100 for the fourth quarter alone. Additionally, we developed our first proprietary Verafin GenAI Copilot, which is now in beta with our customers. Our GenAI tools reduce time and resources spent on manual tasks and processes such as alert reviews, research and documentation. By increasing our operational efficiency, Verafin enables our clients to invest in resilient growth at an attractive ROI. In Surveillance, we signed 27 new clients in 2023, including six in the fourth quarter. We made significant strides in modernizing our solutions by launching a new cloud-based architecture and capabilities within Surveillance user interfaces. These innovations give our clients the ability to calibrate their Surveillance setup more efficiently and effectively. Today, 50% of Nasdaq Trade Surveillance clients, leverage our cloud-deployed solutions which support access to 200 sophisticated alerts across more than 160 markets globally. As we continue to enhance our surveillance capabilities, we're encouraged by the early adoption of our NextGen cloud architecture and new user interfaces. Moving onto Market Services, in the fourth quarter, we maintained our strong 72% market share for our cash equities markets in the Nordics against the challenging volume environment across the European markets. We've also continued to demonstrate a leading market position in the US equities and options markets. In the fourth quarter, we benefited from robust closing cross volumes from the S&P, MSCI and our own Nasdaq rebalance events and we continue to experience growth -- growing adoption of our NDX Index Options product. Additionally, we continue to advance the modernization of markets with the successful migration of our second half US options market to the AWS cloud infrastructure and with the SEC approval of the first AI-powered order type called Dynamic M-ELO, which we expect to launch in the first quarter of 2024. Altogether, we're moving with speed while delivering revenue growth at an attractive margin profile that will drive shareholder value. With the year ahead now in focus, I'd like to share our enterprise priorities for 2024. Our first priority is to continue the successful integration of Adenza. We've made great progress in the initial phase of the integration and remain confident in our ability to deliver on the goals that we laid out at the time of the deal. Second, we're accelerating the impact of our divisional structure to activate and unlock new opportunities that will drive our business into the future. Over the past year, we have delivered significant progress across each of our business divisions and we will continue to realize the benefits of this structure in 2024. Third, we are institutionalizing client listening across the company to unlock revenue growth through a One Nasdaq approach to our client engagements. In 2024, we have a focused program to organize our client data, advance our CRM and other related systems, and enhance our processes across the enterprise to gain a holistic understanding of our clients with a goal to drive partnerships in cross-selling opportunities going forward. And fourth, we will further amplify the impact that AI has on the business and in our products. Nasdaq is leveraging several critical components to ensure AI is implemented safely, securely and fairly. And through our focus on AI, coupled with the vast proprietary data sets that we've created over decades in our markets and in our solutions covering investment analytics, investor relations and Anti-Financial Crime, we're confident that we can extend Nasdaq's competitive advantage in the years ahead. We look forward to updating you on our progress on these priorities at Investor Day and in the quarters to come. To wrap up, 2023 was another year defined by significant strategic and operational milestones and strong execution. As we look ahead to 2024, we're well-positioned to better serve our clients more holistically as we become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review our financial details. Sure. Yeah. I would just say on an ARR growth perspective, we did provide you kind of that mid-teens view of ARR growth and we continue to see the business dynamics supporting that. And so we would expect that, that medium-term outlook for Adenza will continue to support that mid-teens growth. I think that as we know, revenue growth is -- also is impacted by timing of bookings, timing of renewals there and whether or not it's on-prem or cloud. So we're going to actually unpack that at Investor Day to help you understand how do you turn ARR into revenue, how do revenue dynamics change and recognizing there would be more quarterly shift in revenues. But the general view is that, that ARR growth is definitely the fundamental thing to look at in terms of how you evaluate the growth and progress of Adenza or Calypso and Axiom. And at the same time, we do want you to understand how the revenue dynamics work. The more we sign cloud, the more the contracts become ratable over the life of the contract. And whereas in on-prem deals, we recognize half the license fees upfront upon signing. So there's a lot to unpack there. But we feel great about the overall demand drivers. The other thing to think about with Axiom and Calypso is that timing of renewals also can have an impact in revenue recognition. But again, we're seeing really strong demand cycles for both Axiom and Calypso, so we feel very good about that, whereas timing of revenue might be a little different from one to another just based on when the renewal cycles hit in that kind of given year. So that's definitely -- again, we'll go through it. I would say the foundation is very strong and remains consistent with what we expected. Yeah. So actually, I mean, we're not going to get very specific on that particular year. But as a general dynamic, when we look at ARR growth, we basically attribute about half the ARR growth to upsells actually. And we upsold a lot of clients and I can't remember the exact number, but we upsold over 100, almost 150 clients, I think or 120 clients in 2023. And then the other half comes from a combination of pricing increases and new bookings. We don't break that out in terms of that half. But I would just say it is a combination of both. And the way that it works is, obviously, we add a lot of value across the products as we go through the year. And so as we go into both annualized increases that are contractually stated but also renewal cycles, we definitely show that the value of what we're providing to them corresponds with an increase and/or their assets are increasing. And therefore, they're using this across a larger part of their business and that also warrants an increase. But those are -- that dynamic is consistent. Yeah, sure. Well, just by the way, just to be very precise, we had 142 upsells, including three cross-sells in Adenza in 2023. I just wanted to make sure we get the facts out there. But in terms of the listings dynamics, it definitely has been a more challenging environment listings. And as you know, as you point out, the amortization of the initial listing fees is an important dynamic within the listings revenues. It benefits -- it means when we have a really strong year of listings, like we had in 2020 and 2021, we don't recognize all the initial listing fees that year, it kind of gives us a lift in the following years because those fees are amortized over two to four years, depending on the size of the listing. But then it means that when we have two more challenging years, it takes time for that to also filter through. And so we will have kind of residual impact of these lower years in 2024 and 2025 as the initial listing fees from the higher years roll off and we don't have, as you've noticed, kind of a net reduction in listings in 2023. So we would expect that 2024 will be a challenging year for listings. Within the data and listings business, though, we basically are saying that it's a low to mid-single digit grower, and we would anticipate that we can still achieve that, even with the more muted listing revenue that we would expect in 2024. Sure. So all of the solutions within Workflow & Insights are SaaS solutions. So how you end the year really determines a lot about the following year. And so we definitely saw a more challenging environment with corporates last year. The listing environment was more muted, but also they were just not as focused on investing across IR in a more challenging market backdrop. That improved in the fourth quarter. And so we did start to have a more, I would say, more normalized environment for conversations and signings of corporate clients for our IR solutions in the fourth quarter, but it was against the backdrop of a harder year overall. So it will take time for that improved environment to actually flow through and show up in the actual SaaS revenues because we obviously have to continue to see that and it will kind of build on itself. But I would expect that 2024 will continue to kind of have some overhang from the weaker environment in \u201823, even with a more normalized sales environment. With analytics, it's actually what's interesting, our overall analytics growth was quite strong in the fourth quarter at 9%. And I think that, that really reflects demand for our data across the buy side and the analytic solutions we have that serve the buy side. But our asset owner solutions, this is a very specific software capability that we offer to endowments and pensions and others. That actually did have an uptick in demand and signing in the fourth quarter, but it was an overall difficult year. So that again, I think will create a headwind as we go through 2024 with the hope that we can start to show some pick-up as we go through the year. I would say we will provide at least more color on that in Investor Day. But if we think about it, I think, Sarah, it's like 14% of overall revenue? And then in ARR, it's 21%? Yeah, 21% of ARR is cloud. So we have a lot of runway here. So as we renew clients, moving them into the cloud modules, as we sign new clients, sign them for new modules. But recognizing that we can sign a client just on a new module in cloud, like it doesn't have to be that they're signing for Calypso and they're adding new functionality, just that new functionality we can deliver in cloud. That's how flexible the platform is. They don't have to kind of redo the whole platform implementation on cloud. But that also means that as we work with clients on renewals and changes, is they're going to have different timelines for how they want to bring that cloud capabilities in. Some banks are marching very fast into cloud and they have like actually top down mandates to move to cloud and that can obviously be a huge catalyst for us. But other banks are marching quite slowly towards it. So we want to be flexible. We expect this to be, as we said, very much a multi-year transition, going from 21% of ARR and growing and growing. But I have to say, it will be a slow moving train. In terms of the economics, it is both an opportunity for us to be a true managed service provider, which gives us more revenue opportunity, and also provide it with a very nice margin for both them and us. So that's an opportunity for uplift, but again, a slow moving train. So we'll want to make sure that we give you a little more color on that at Investor Day. Well, we don't actually provide specific contract values per client or anything like that. If you don't mind, I think we'll take that one back and think about how we want to provide more transparency there. But I would say this, it's always land and expand. And actually as we move up into Tier 2s and Tier 1s [on ASCs] (ph), it's land and expand. So we might sign a client for, let's say mid to high six figures or low seven figures to land. And then as we expand, we can go and we can double or triple, or even in some cases, you know, have five times the amount over time. And I do think we have some examples of that back when we first signed the deal and on our third quarter results, we gave some examples of how we've expanded contracts over time, but we're not providing you specifics on, like, what the new contract values were for the new clients right now. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. So I think we did see some declines in the growth and net retention in the latter part of the year. And I think really a lot of that did come from the bankruptcy that we mentioned and that really did start impacting us in the fourth quarter. And then, we had, I would just say the, what I would call the events of 2023 across the banking system did create some levels of challenge in a couple of very specific areas of retention, but it's not, I would say there was nothing systemic about the concern. There was nothing that we saw that was that was more of a trend in any way whatsoever. It was more the encapsulation of a lot of the events that occurred during the year both in terms of looking at the retention as well as kind of some of the acquisitions that occurred. But again, these are very, very specific and nothing trend-wise. But I don't know, Sarah, if you want to add anything to that. Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you. You know, one thing we're pretty good at is that, that just leaving 2023, as Sarah mentioned, we're at 4.3 times leverage. So that's ahead of what we had anticipated at the closing of the deal. And so that's actually kind of both the strength of the business, as well as some very specific tactical decisions we made to pay down the term loan as we're kind of getting started to kind of launch into 2024 with a very solid plan on deleveraging. But also the focus though will be on that balanced approach over time. Yeah, go ahead. Sure, yeah. So I would say that, first of all, we've been really focused on making sure that we are being as efficient as possible across the business, just on a go -- on a run rate basis. That we are also though continuing to make the investments in driving our products forward, our growth forward, but also automation, on bringing more automation into the company. And at the same time, beginning the synergy achievement on the Adenza deal. And the midpoint really reflects all of that. What would drive the expenses above that would be higher growth. So if we're able to grow faster and we're able to grow more, there might be some revenue related expenses that come in in terms of just being able to achieve that revenue. But I think that it has also more to do with can we continue to actually accelerate some of our investments if we're seeing higher revenue growth throughout the year. And that's why we always give you a range of kind of the mid to long term outlook on our solutions business growth, revenue growth, and expense growth so that you can kind of understand how we calibrate it. But we do feel like it's been a good combination at the midpoint of expense discipline, Adenza synergies, but also targeted investments in our business. Sure. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, so we are really proud to partner with BlackRock and Valkyrie as they brought their Bitcoin ETFs to Nasdaq. And it really does give investors an opportunity to express a view on the trend of Bitcoin without having -- in a highly regulated marketplace and without having to go and actually buy Bitcoin. So we do think it creates more accessibility for retail investors to have a position at Bitcoin. I think that in terms of the broader digital asset space though, as you know, we are a tech provider to the industry. We continue to provide technology to cryptocurrency exchanges, both trading, clearing, and as well as surveillance. And actually, as we've been working with some traditional exchanges, they want to make sure that they're kind of future proof. So for instance, with one of the CSD clients that we sold to this year, one of the key things is to make sure that they could move towards digital assets in their settlement system. And so we are, all of our technology can support digital assets in terms of trading, clearing settlement, surveillance. And that gives us a chance to work with the traditional exchanges and crypto exchanges. In terms of our specific crypto custody solution, we have built it. We are ready to provide that to exchanges and providers and custodians around the world. So that is now a technology offering that we can offer to clients around the world. But we have made a conscious choice not to launch a custody solution, being a custodian ourselves. I think that we feel that there are several out there that they're operating well, but it's also a very capital-intensive business. And our view is that we are better served being a market operator for the ETFs and other instruments like that, as well as being a technology provider to the industry. Sure. So I would say that, we'll take Calypso and AxiomSL separately. AxiomSL did do a significant rewrite of their technology a few years ago. So we feel very good about kind of how they're positioned. But, and then Calypso actually, they are super flexible and very modular. So they kind of have this continuum of investment in Calypso. And they've been able to, because of that, they've actually been much more able to, both of them are focused on just bringing in new modules very quickly and iterating on their technology. So we feel really good about the tech foundation. And I think we said that at the time of signing. And now that we've closed on a deal, we've looked under the hood, it is a great technology and it's very modular and kind of platform-based. I think the area that we can really help focus them is on how do we really optimize the cloud implementation to make it so that it's as efficient as possible for them and their clients. And so we have a lot of expertise there. We've had a long history of cloud deployed solutions. And so we do actually think that's an area where we can help them invest to make it so that that can be even more effectively and efficiently delivered. But that's not a significant capital investment as much as that's just continuing innovation. They have been investing in R&D, so that has been a hallmark of their business. And so we are really pleased to see that. And we will continue that, but that's not something where there's a big CapEx requirement right now. We really do see it as a continuum of innovation. In terms of our CapEx across the year, I think, I don't know if they have any specific things that you want to mention there. For surveillance. I think, as you know, Brian -- as you know, Brian, we have a kind of an 18% to 23% kind of expectation across CSD. Now, as we move to reg tech and we integrate that with AxiomSL, we're going to be providing kind of a view and I think it's -- I always look at it as 10% to 14% across fintech, all told. And that will incorporate Verafin and surveillance along with market tech and the Adenza products. Great, thank you. And as we enter another exciting year at Nasdaq, we remain focused on activating and unlocking new opportunities that will drive the business into the future. Before I close, I want to remind everyone, if you didn't remember already, that we have our scheduled 2024 Investor Day on for Tuesday, March 5th. We hope to see you all there, either in person or virtually, and we look forward to sharing our vision with you. Thank you for joining us and have a great day."

My commentary will be focused on non-GAAP results and year-on-year growth rate will be provided on an organic basis. Similarly, operating margins will be discussed ex-Adenza for comparability purposes. I will discuss Adenza's [generic] (ph) results at the end of the fintech section.

In an uncertain environment, we delivered solid financial performance and strong cash flow generation. Revenue of $3.9 billion was up 5%, with solutions revenue of $2.9 billion, an increase of 7%. Non-GAAP expense was $1.8 billion, up 5%, in line with guidance for a 52% operating margin, which was flat versus the prior year. This resulted in diluted EPS of $2.82, reflecting organic growth of 6%. We had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, a growth rate of 11%. Moving on to the fourth quarter on Slide 13. We reported revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $860 million, an increase of 9%. Non-GAAP expense was $504 million, up 2%, and with an operating margin of 52%, up 3 percentage points. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.72, reflecting organic growth of 11%. Turning to Slide 14. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 6% organically. The annualized SaaS revenue totaled $910 million, representing organic growth of 12%. Excluding Adenza, SaaS was 38% of ARR, an improvement of 2 percentage points. Including Adenza, that number is 35%, which will improve as the cloud portion of their revenue increases. As a reminder, we only consider the cloud portion of their revenue to be SaaS. Let's review division results for the quarter starting on Slide 15. For capital access platforms, revenue of $461 million increased 10%, driven by excellent performance in Index. In Data and Listing Services, we saw 3% growth. In data, we have seen a continued increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. In listings, the positive impact of pricing was partially offset by the combined impact of de-listings, a muted IPO environment and the rollup of prior year's initial listings revenue. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 3%. Analytics delivered high single digit growth, reflecting our ability to monetize the value of our data to the buy side with new business and increased pricing across traditional and alternative asset managers. The strength in analytics was partially offset by a weaker capital raising markets and the impact of elongated sales cycle in corporate solutions. Index revenue increased 26% and overall AUM grew by 34%. Over the last 12 months, our net inflows were $31 billion, $10 billion of which occurred during the fourth quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased as well, driven by higher capture partially offset by a decline in trading volumes. As a reminder, our capture increases once we cross a volume threshold and then resets at the beginning of each year. While smaller in size, Index revenue also benefited from index data revenue growth. ARR for capital access platforms was $1.2 billion, up 3%. ARR growth was largely driven by analytics and to a lesser extent, data and listings. The muted IPO environment impacted ARR growth. However, we are cautiously optimistic that we could see a recovery in IPOs combined with more normalized sales cycles as we progress through 2024. As a reminder, substantially all our Index revenue is excluded from ARR. The division's operating margin was 54% for the quarter, an increase of 4 percentage points due to higher revenues. For the full year, it was 55%, up roughly by 50 basis points. The increase was driven by higher revenues, partially offset by inflation, revenue-related expense, and investments in particular across data and Index. Moving to financial technology on Slide 16. The division delivered revenue of $399 million for the quarter, up 8%. Regulatory technology grew 17% with Verafin at 25%. Verafin added 100 new clients this quarter, including our Tier -- third Tier 1 bank. While we are excited about these additions, as we have previously discussed, the contracting and implementation with these larger, more complex institutions is longer. We will start recognizing subscription revenue in 2024 but we believe that the effect will only accelerate as we expand relationships with these clients. The strong performance of Verafin along with 6% growth in Surveillance led to the 17% growth of regulatory technology. For Surveillance, the fourth quarter growth was impacted by the timing of bookings in 2023 versus 2022, but fundamentals remained strong for the year with six new clients in the fourth quarter and 27 for the full year. We also made inroads with the Tier 3 broker client cohort, which reflects progress beyond our leadership position with large banks. Cloud for trade Surveillance is now above 50% deployment, which is an important driver of client stickiness through the speed and efficiency it enables us to provide. Moving on to Capital Markets Technology, we saw 3% growth driven by data center connectivity demand. We had new market tech contract signings in Latin America and with one of our US Tier 1 clients. We expect these contracts to start to accrue in 2024. As Adena mentioned, we continue to increase our market technology presence in Latin America and to have a leading role in the modernization of markets in the region. ARR for FinTech totaled $1.35 billion, an increase of 10% due to continued customer wins at Verafin as well as growth in Trade Management Services and Market Technology. The division's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 40%, up 4 percentage points. The organic margin expansion reflects solid top line growth and expense control with an overall increase in revenue-related costs, offset by efficiencies and lower professional fees. We are progressing on our journey to improve the efficiencies in Market Technology while continuing to support the growth of Verafin and Surveillance. For the full year, the operating margin was 40%, up 5 percentage points with a story which mirrors that of the quarter, including strong operating leverage and investments. Before closing on FinTech, a few additional words on Adenza. For November and December, Adenza contributed [$149] (ph) million in revenue, $458 million of ARR of which $98 million was in SaaS, and $35 million in non-GAAP operating expense. A strong finish to the year drove a 77% operating margin for our two month ownership. On a full year basis, Adenza had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59%, ahead of our initial 58% outlook for the year. Let me now talk about Adenza's full year revenue and ARR. Revenue was $583 million in 2023, up 14%. ARR of $458 million with 16%, excluding a significant bankruptcy that occurred during the year or 14% net of it. Both metrics are on a constant currency basis. We had nearly 50% of new ACV coming from cloud this year. The strong cloud take-up by our clients supports our growth and efficiencies. Revenue growth benefited from a large portion of ARR up for renewal in the quarter and in the year. Going forward, we expect Adenza's revenue growth to be in the low to mid-teens, consistent with the medium to long term outlook we provided when we announced the acquisition. The timing of contracts being up for renewal and the mix of revenue between cloud and on-premise delivery will have an impact on revenue growth in any given quarter and year. This is why we are focused on ARR growth, which is not as impacted by annual renewable and delivery method. We'll provide more details on the revenue dynamics of our FinTech division at Investor Day. And wrapping up our divisional overview with Market Services. Net revenue was $247 million for the quarter, roughly flat with growth in US cash equities offset by decreases in US options. US cash equities growth was driven by higher capture, partially offset by lower share. In a very competitive US options environment, we are defending our strong market share lead and our attractive capture. Meanwhile, in Europe, tepid exchange volumes were positively offset by a $7 million nonrecurring payment and by the benefits of diversification between fixed income and equity. The investments we have made in leveraging our technology and data to provide our European market clients with transparency helps them to generate [indiscernible]. This has enabled us to help our clients improve their execution quality and has been key to our ability to reclaim our 72% market share, a 2 percentage point increase. The division's operating margin was 57% in the fourth quarter 2023 compared to 60% in the prior year quarter as a result of higher compensation costs as we continue to invest in our people and higher technology costs due to ongoing investments related to both capacity and migrating US market to the cloud. The full year operating margin for the division totaled 59% with the same drivers as recorded history. Turning to Slide 19. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $504 million, an organic increase of $8 million or 2% versus our organic revenue growth of 7%. I went through the story in the businesses, and it reflects good expense discipline as well as the timing of marketing and professional fees. Overall, this reflects a 52% operating margin, up 3 percentage points. For the full year, our non-GAAP operating expense was $1.83 billion, in line with guidance. We were up 5% consistent with revenue growth for a flat operating margin at 52%. The increase is due to investments in key growth areas, inflation and higher revenue-related expense. We also achieved efficiencies during the year as we continue to optimize our location footprint and bring the divisions together as part of our divisional realignment. If you include Adenza for the full year, operating expense totaled $2.05 billion. Now on to guidance. We are initiating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance of $2.105 billion to $2.185 billion, the midpoint of which reflects pro forma growth of 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza and the in-year expense benefit of net synergies. On an organic basis, excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth will be just under 4.5%. We will spend more time on synergies at Investor Day, but we reiterate the net $80 million synergy target by the end of 2025 and $80 million cost to achieve are set forth in the restructuring program we just initiated. Additionally, we are guiding the full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis, slightly higher than 2023, due to lower expected tax benefit on equity awards. Turning to Slide 20. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. For the year, we had $1.6 billion of free cash flow ex-Adenza, and Adenza had $306 million in unlevered pretax free cash flow. Our gross leverage ratio was expected to be at 4.7 times at the time of deal close but we are pleased to share that at year-end, we are at 4.3 times despite 0.1 times headwind from euro strength. Let's go through the details on the chart. At the end of the third quarter, our adjusted leverage ratio was 2.4 times. We added the leverage to acquire Adenza. At the beginning of December, we posted share repurchases and repaid $260 million of term loans. The ratio benefited from the incremental EBITDA from Adenza's full year and net tax growth. We expect to continue deleveraging in the first quarter of 2024. And to wrap up on free cash flow utilization, we have repurchased $269 million of our common stock this year, including $110 million in the fourth quarter. And we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share for a 35% annualized payout ratio. In closing today, this quarter and this year's performance shows Nasdaq's ability to deliver consistent growth, margin and free cash flow in a range of environments. We are committed to disciplined execution and continued innovation. The investment we have made in our resilience, our technology and our data over the years, coupled with our reach and track record, position us for sustainable growth as we power our client's success. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Sure. Hey, Owen. Yeah. So we -- as you said, we closed on November 1. We immediately created the operating model on a go-forward basis, meaning we combined the teams. We have a leader structure now that is a combination of Adenza and Nasdaq personnel under Tal. And we've been working very hard to make sure that we bring the sales organizations together, the client delivery success, the operating teams as well as the technology teams together. And so, Owen, I think it's only a couple of months in, but we are definitely operating as one team. We have been -- we have a very specific and defined synergy plan. We have a very clear line of sight as to how we're going to achieve that plan. We will provide more details on that. But I would say, Owen, that across all of Nasdaq, we have a combination of efforts to make sure that we create efficiencies within the team just as a normal acquisition, integration would occur, but then also a locational strategy that allows us to align ourselves with our clients going forward and leverage the strengths that Adenza has in some very critical centers of excellence around the world. So we do have, I think, a good plan. We will provide more details at Investor Day. And then the last thing I would say on revenue synergies, it's obviously very early days, and it takes time to sign new deals. It takes time to develop those relationships. But the early conversations that I've had and that Tal and Valerie, who's the Chief Revenue Officer, have had has been extremely encouraging. People really want to partner with us. They see us now as a partner to help them solve their largest problems. That's across reg tech, that's across anti-fin crime and risk management. I think they understand that we understand them. We are regulated. We have great relationships with the regulators. I mean, they also understand we can bring a lot of advanced technology in and advanced cloud capabilities within Adenza. So I have to tell you that the early conversations are really great. But as we've said all along, it will take time for those revenue synergies to actually show up in the financials. And again, we'll provide you more color on that at Investor Day. Yeah, sure. Yeah, thanks for pointing that out, Owen. We did create a study that -- we're working with two outside parties. So it was both outside parties and us. We interviewed a lot of the key personnel within banks that are responsible for anti-fin crime to understand, number one, how big is the problem. $3 trillion of money laundered through the system, $0.5 trillion lost to fraud. And then how big is the problem in terms of actually having to solve it? And what are the challenges? One is that different criminal actors act differently. So you have to really have different typologies of analytics to try to root out different criminal behaviors, number one. Number two, obviously, we've always said criminals, they don't just bank in one bank. So a single bank cannot look at all their transaction data and actually solve the problem. So Verafin is really a truly unique solution because we do have 2,500 banks that represent $6 trillion of assets, all within a consortium data link that allow us to find very defined topologies and really root out more criminal behavior. So we're seeing fewer false positives, more fraud found, more AML found, and we're able to prove that out, and that's why we've been able to sign up the Tier 1s and Tier 2s with another Tier 1 signed in the fourth quarter. Where we've been focusing? I would say, a couple of things, Owen. One is on continuing to kind of have that flywheel on the SMBs. And in that particular case, we're really focused on moving to real-time payments and making sure that the small to medium banks have world-class AFC around their real-time payments. And so that's a big growth area for us in '24. In the larger banks, we've been -- definitely the easiest ROI to show is fraud. So payment like wire fraud, ACH fraud, check fraud, all of the payments fraud we're finding is a huge benefit and very clear ROI. AML is a harder problem to solve, but we actually had signed one of the large Tier 2s, I think actually two of the large Tier 2s is really focused on AML. And as we solve the fraud problem, what we're also finding is as soon as we go into these large banks, we show them our benefit on fraud. They're already starting talk to us on AML. So that's the land and expand opportunity that we have. And we definitely see expansion opportunities in '24 with the banks you've already signed. And then the last thing I would say is that we also are really focused now in the UK. And in fact, Brendan is meeting with banks this week to really understand and look at our -- particularly our payments fraud capabilities in the UK. The laws are changing to allow for more data sharing, and that will make it so that our pooling is much more effective in supporting their problem and making it so that we can provide a solution there. So that's our next leg of growth as we go through '24 into '25. 14% of revenue is currently cloud and [50%] (ph) of new ACV bookings. 21%. Yeah, the retention on a gross basis was actually flat at 97% if you exclude that bankruptcy. So when we look at it in terms of like long-term trends, we feel that it's very solid. Hey, Mike. Nice speaking to you. This is Sarah. So what we have is the strategy that we have outlined is maintained. So we have a balanced view of how to deal with the capital allocation just to reiterate across the dividends, the share repurchase, and the deleveraging. You've seen the pause, as I mentioned, and that pause is going to be maintained in the first quarter. Very important for us to continue to deleverage, and -- but that is a short-term tactical as part of a strategy that overall hasn't changed. So we continue to be committed to the progressive dividend, and you've seen the progress there as well as over time it's important to continue to offset dilution with share repurchase. And so that's the context, and of course this is also a topic that we'll come back to at Investor Day. No, we don't have, like, any particular trends, so you're not going to see, like, a particular acceleration or something of note. We're continuing to invest in the business, and we'll come back and give you a lot of, like, color at Investor Day on the type of returns and the type of breakdowns of our investments. And we have very much a cash on cash view as to what it gives us and in addition to, of course, the investments that are foundational in the business. So what I said is that, the 25% indeed is the growth for Verafin. And together with surveillance, you end up at 17%. So that's a 6% for surveillance. That is due to a timing of bookings in 2022 that had been an impact on the year-on-year growth for the fourth quarter. So it's really just timing in the prior year period. For surveillance. So we continue to focus on our operating margin and to focus on having operating leverage as we invest on a GAAP basis, but we will always give you the details on the ARR basis, which is really the better economic view of what we are doing."

I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Nasdaq's third quarter earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to offer brief comment on the situation in the Middle East. We were horrified by the acts of terrorist violence that occurred in Israel last week, and we were deeply saddened by the subsequent loss of innocent lives in Israel, Gaza and the wider region. Our focus has been on supporting our people and our clients with connections in the region. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay engaged with them throughout this emerging crisis. Turning now to my remarks about the quarter. I will start by covering Nasdaq's performance and how our strategy is unfolding in the context of the current operating environment, as well as provide key business highlights. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a detailed review of our financial results. I'm pleased to share that Nasdaq continues to make solid progress in our strategic objectives to capitalize on the key megatrends shaping the financial system. Nasdaq continues to execute against the strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the global financial system, delivering broad-based growth across our businesses, including 6% overall net revenue growth and 8% year-over-year organic revenue growth in our Solutions Businesses. I'm proud of the team's efforts to continue to serve our clients and I'm pleased to see our revenue growth improving in the third quarter, aided by strong performance in our Capital Access Platforms division, particularly in our Index business. In addition, our Anti-Financial Crime division delivered -- continued to deliver strong results with solid growth in our Surveillance business and Verafin continuing to demonstrate strong new customer growth, as well as an expansion contract with the Tier 2 clients. With respect to the market backdrop, during the quarter, we saw variety of cross currents, including increasing market volatility, fluctuating equities markets and rising long-term interest rates. Nevertheless, we experienced modestly improving momentum in our Listings business amid a gradual re-emergence of the U.S. IPO activity with 35 operating companies choosing to list in Nasdaq during the quarter. Based on our client conversations and our growing IPO pipeline, we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the upcoming year. Across the company, as we've discussed before, Nasdaq is well-positioned to thrive by capitalizing on three key megatrends that are shaping the financial system: the modernization of markets, the development of the corporate and investor ecosystem for environmental sustainability, and the increasing need for integrity solutions across the financial system, including risk management, surveillance, regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime technology. By aligning our business to these key megatrends, we're unlocking attractive opportunities for sustainable growth and we're building a diversified business that's well-positioned to succeed through economic cycles. In this regard, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate the progress we're making to capitalize on these growth opportunities. First, our focus on market modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. A major driver of that innovation has been our ability to adopt and leverage technologies, including cloud and artificial intelligence across our markets and in our products. In the third quarter, we are pleased to announce the approval by the SEC of the first exchange AI-powered order type, which we call Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order or Dynamic M-ELO. For the last several years, we've offered an order type called the Midpoint Extended Life Order for clients seeking larger trade sizes at the midpoint. The order introduces a fixed holding period together order interest before execution. Through extensive testing and consultation, we determined that our clients trade execution could be improved under certain market conditions by applying adaptable holding periods. This led to the creation of Dynamic M-ELO, which leverages AI to adjust the length of holding periods throughout the trading day on a stock-by-stock basis to improved fill rates and reduce market friction. We're very excited to rollout this enhanced order type to our clients in the coming months. And we see significant opportunity ahead to drive the application of AI and other emerging technologies across our markets. Next, regarding the development of the environmental sustainable ecosystem, during the quarter, we were proud to launch two new offerings designed to help corporates and investors streamline their sustainability journeys. Following the acquisition of Metrio last year, we have integrated Nasdaq's OneReport and Metrio's sustainability reporting and workflow offerings into a single solution called Nasdaq Metrio, which was officially launched during the quarter. Nasdaq Metrio is a SaaS based end-to-end solution that helps corporates better collect, measure and report sustainability data on a single platform. In addition, in our Investment Intelligence business, we announced the launch of Nasdaq eVestment ESG Analytics, which is designed to help asset managers better quantify and showcase the environmental, social and/or governance impact of our portfolio's position in the market. It enables asset managers to demonstrate their portfolio's sustainability strategies to asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments. These two solutions underscore our role as a bridge between corporates and investors by creating market-based demand driven solutions that help bring clarity to a rapidly evolving environment for sustainability reporting. Lastly, looking at the increasing need for integrity solutions, including risk management and anti-financial crime technology, we're developing innovations that make our clients anti-money laundering or AML programs more efficient. Specifically, in October, we have launched the beta version of an AML workflow to co-pilot tool that will leverage generative AI to automate portions of our clients' AML processes. We look forward to updating you on our progress with these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to leverage technology to advance our clients' evolving needs. Turning next to our results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. We achieved $940 million net revenues, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year period, an increase of 5% on an organic basis. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $694 million, up 9% from the prior year period and 8% on an organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million in the third quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 37% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $456 million in total revenue in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 15% from the prior year period. The performance in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance, $24 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months, including $5 million in the third quarter and strong features capture, partially offset by lower derivatives volumes. Our Workflow and Insights revenues grew 5% over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for project work in our ESG Solutions and steady analytics solutions sales to asset managers. While we continue to see elongated sales cycles for certain products in this business, we've not seen a material improvement or worsening of sales cycles from the second quarter of 2023. Our Data and Listing Services revenues grew 5%. Our Listings revenues was largely unchanged due to continued muted IPO activity and heightened de-listings, while our Data business delivered continued strong revenue growth, driven by demand from international data clients. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings, ending the quarter with strong momentum from some of the year's biggest IPOs by proceeds raised. Year-to-date, Nasdaq welcomed 83 new operating company IPOs for an 84% win rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we have welcomed four of the five top IPOs by capital raised. And in the third quarter, we achieved an overall win rate of 95% and welcomed several marquee IPOs including Arm Holdings and Instacart. This momentum was also bolstered by several notable listing switches to Nasdaq in the quarter, including DoorDash and Roper Technologies. Overall, 11 companies had transfered to Nasdaq year-to-date, representing a total market value of $184 billion. The September Listing success coincides with the launch of our new IPO and Broadcast Center at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square, further establishing Nasdaq as the world's premier venue for listings. The reimagined space reflects our commitment to showcasing our clients and elevating their IPO experience, and enables us to create more visibility for first trade celebrations through increased access to global media outlets. Looking ahead, we remain well-positioned to capture new listings activity. We have a strong pipeline of companies who are committed to Nasdaq and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO timelines. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $381 million in total revenues during the third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. In our Trading business, revenues declined 1% compared to the prior year, with lower European revenue, partially offset by modest growth in U.S. equities revenue due to higher revenue capture and a small FX benefit. In our Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 4% with growth in both trade management services and market technology solutions. During the period, we completed delivery of a major CSD project for a Latin American central securities depository and signed a contract extension, including an upgrade to our next-gen trading system with one of the largest stock exchanges in Southeast Asia. Turning next to a brief update on Adenza. We're progressing well towards the closing of the Adenza transaction. We have completed the anti-trust review and Thoma Bravo is on track to obtain the remaining approvals from the Nordic and Baltic financial regulators to become a major shareholder in Nasdaq. Therefore, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously disclosed, this business will be reported as part of the newly created Financial Technology division, alongside our Marketplace Technology and Anti-Financial Crime businesses. In the third quarter, Adenza continued its strong performance, delivering constant currency ARR growth in the high-teens. Year-to-date through the third quarter, they added 17 new clients and three total cross-sells, which compares to seven new clients and three cross-sells over the same period last year. Additionally, Adenza maintains solid growth in net revenue retention at 97.4% and 113%, respectively. We're also pleased with the momentum of Adenza's journey towards the cloud-based delivery of its solutions across both existing and new clients. Through the first three quarters of 2023, 55% of bookings have been for cloud delivery solutions versus 27% over the same period last year. Since the transaction was announced in June, we've held extensive integration and planning discussions with the leadership team at Adenza, and we're very excited about the opportunities ahead. As a result of our early interactions together, we have developed a very clear path and process for integration that we intend to execute successfully starting on day one post-close. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $93 million in total revenue during the third quarter, a 21% increase in the prior year period. Nasdaq Verafin grew 29% primarily driven by growth in the adoption of our Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering or FRAML solutions by small and medium sized banks, as well as an expansion of wallet share among existing clients. We continue to expand client relationships with 47 new small-medium sized financial institutions adopting our FRAML solutions. Additionally, we continue to have momentum in our move-up market. This quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with an existing Tier 2 bank client. Specifically, this is a bank client that's signed on to our Fraud Detection and Workflow solution in the first quarter of 2023 and is now expanded their relationship with us to include our complex investigations solution. We view this expansion as a strong proof point and our ability to land and expand our relationships with large bank clients. We continue to be actively engaged in contract negotiations and proof-of-concepts with several Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, and remain on track with our plans to sign additional large banks in the coming quarters. Our Surveillance business delivered 9% organic revenue growth with continued new customer growth including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers as we expanded our leadership position with large customers. And lastly, I'm pleased to announce that we've officially named Brendan Brothers, Executive Vice President of our Anti-Financial Crime division. As you may recall, Brendan was named to the role on an interim basis earlier this year and we're thrilled to welcome him formally as a member of our leadership team continuing to report directly to me. To wrap-up, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business and reflect our strong position going into year-end with the closing of the Adenza transaction view. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter 2023 performance, beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $940 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including an 8% organic increase in the Solutions Businesses and slightly lower Trading Services revenue, and $3 million in net positive impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 4%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 90 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $349 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $335 million, or $0.68 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million, an increase of 11%. ARR and SaaS revenue growth in the quarter reflect broad based growth led by continued bookings strength in our Anti-Financial Crime division. We are delivering solid performance despite ongoing elongated sales cycles in certain areas of our Workflow and Insights business similar to recent quarters. We are working closely with our customers in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and are executing well on our strategic pillars of bringing liquidity, transparency and integrity to financial markets. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15. Starting with the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $2 million or 1%, driven by a positive impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services organic revenue was down 2% driven by lower European trading revenues due to lower volumes. Despite better cash equity revenue capture that offset largely flat U.S. revenues. While we have seen an increase in off-exchange trading, which is common in a lower volatility environment, Nasdaq share of available volume has remained steady. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, reflecting solid revenue growth in our Market Technology business. As a reminder, Marketplace Technology revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery that we don't expect to recur in the second half of the year. We continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium term outlook. ARR totaled $511 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period. This growth rate is lower compared to prior periods due to slower Trade Management Services growth resulting from near term market conditions. Market Platforms operating margin was 52% in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 370 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue, resulting from lower European trading activity, as well as higher compensation costs, ongoing investments related to migrating U.S. markets to the cloud, and investment in new growth opportunities in Marketplace Technology. Turning to Capital Access Platforms. Revenues increased $34 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $32 million and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. We delivered broad based organic growth in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in Index. Index revenue increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 22% increase in average AUM over the prior year quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased 14%, reflecting higher pricing per contract, partially offset by a decline in trading volume. Additionally, we saw in net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $24 billion including $5 billion in the quarter. While AUM has benefited from a strong year-to-date market performance, we saw AUM impacted by overall markets trending lower in the last two months of the quarter. Moving to Data and Listing Services. Our revenue grew 5%; excluding the positive impact from changes in FX rates, our organic growth was 4%. Revenue growth reflects continued strength in our Data business and the combined impact of de-listings and a more muted IPO environment on Listings revenue growth. However, as Adena mentioned, we have seen several high profile initial listings and 11 switches year-to-date. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the third quarter of '22, reflecting growth across our ESG and Analytics businesses, despite ongoing elongated sales cycles with corporates, particularly for our IR tools and for our asset owner portfolio management solutions, affecting revenue growth in the third quarter. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. While ARR growth related to our data products remained solid, the Capital Access Platforms ARR growth rate has been impacted by slower listings growth and the impacts of continuing elongated sales cycles on parts of our Corporate Solutions and Analytics businesses. The division operating margin was 56% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of roughly 50 basis points from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $16 million or 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Growth reflects robust demand for Fraud Detection and Anti-Money Laundering solutions, as well as our SaaS-based Surveillance Solutions. Our Fraud Detection and AML solutions revenues grew 29% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 with continued customer growth including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers. These new customer wins reflect our ability to drive growth beyond our leadership position with large banks and expand into new customer segments. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $348 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced totaled $381 million, an increase of 19% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 33% in the third quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period with approximately one half of the margin growth resulting from the timing of recognition of incentive compensation. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $32 million to $449 million. The increase primarily reflects a $32 million organic increase or 8%. The organic year-over-year increase reflects increased compensation and benefits expense due primarily to increased headcount and the impact of merit increases, higher technology spend attributable to continued investment in our business and higher G&A expense. We are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.785 billion to $1.805 billion, which is a $10 million reduction to the top end of the guidance range. As a result, the midpoint of the updated expense guidance range is $5 million lower than our prior guidance, which reflects an annual expense increase of approximately 4.5% for 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, we narrowed our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance range from 24% to 26% to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. We expect to come in at or around the midpoint of this updated range for the full year. Turning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $108 million. And in September, our Board approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to a total of $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains solid and our cash flow generation is strong, including $1.6 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain well-positioned to support organic growth, execute on the deleveraging plan we announced with the Adenza acquisition, increase our dividend payout ratio over time and repurchase shares to minimize dilution. In closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect the continuation of the Company's ability to perform consistently well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time and I will turn it back over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ann. And before we turn to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Ann Dennison. After eight years at Nasdaq, Ann will be stepping down from her role as CFO at the end of this year. Ann has been a guiding voice to the market on our financial performance, a leader in enhancing our Investor Relations and ESG reporting efforts, and as steward to our company's transformation, most recently, through our announced acquisition of Adenza. In conjunction with Ann's upcoming departure from Nasdaq, we're pleased to welcome Sarah Youngwood as our next EVP and CFO. Sarah will join us from UBS Group, where she served as CFO and a Group Executive Board member. Sarah will officially join us on December 1, and will work closely with Ann and the team to ensure a seamless transition. I want to thank Ann personally for her many contributions to Nasdaq. She has been a phenomenal partner to me and the company, and we wish her the very best. And now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on Adenza for my first question. I think, Adena, you talked through the update and I think you mentioned the ARR. But can you also just -- hoping you can talk about for both Axiom and Calypso, the year-to-date revenue growth trends for both of the segments? And then related to that, I was hoping you can touch on kind of the revenue opportunity or revenue growth opportunity as you think about clients going from on-prem to the cloud solution for Adenza. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we don't provide or break out the financial, the revenue differences between Axiom and Calypso. But we do provide -- I can give you some color in that, when we're looking at new bookings for the year, we had -- as I mentioned, we had 17 new clients so far in 2020 or I should say they have 17 new clients so far in 2023 and three cross-sells. And when we break that out between Calypso and Axiom, so Calypso had nine new clients sign up and one cross-sell; and Axiom had eight new clients sign up and two cross-sells. And then in terms of the upsells, 95 total and it's really a good even split, 55% upsells in Calypso and 40 in Axiom. So it's really a nice split of revenue growth and opportunity across both of these solutions. When we think about why that is the case, I think that there are a range of reasons, just trends out in the marketplace that are driving demand for both risk management solutions, more advanced risk management solutions for -- across all asset classes, as well as better regulatory reporting solutions. And obviously, those are the two great things that Calypso and Axiom do. And when we think about that acceleration of new sales because they had seven new sales -- new clients sign up last year versus 17 this year, we're definitely seeing a momentum in terms of the regulatory obligations that are coming into the United States as well as the Basel III end game that's really coming across both the U.S. and Europe driving certain demand, but then also moving down market. I mean I think Axiom did a really nice job of bringing in even more banks and brokers into their solutions. So generally, it's just -- we're very pleased with the continued momentum in the business. When it comes to cloud, it's really interesting to see. As I mentioned, the 55% of total bookings were for cloud -- I'm sorry, new bookings were for cloud delivery solutions versus 27%, I think it was last year. And that's really, I think, a combination of two things. One is the fact that banks are more ready to accept cloud delivered solutions. And so that's been a real -- we've seen that across all of our solutions across Nasdaq. They're just more ready to have cloud be a big part of their infrastructure. And they're trying to -- some banks are purposely trying to move out their data centers. I think that the second is that the cloud based delivery solutions are modern. They're modular, they're more flexible. And I think that the team has done a really nice job of selling the benefits of that and you're right in terms of the revenue opportunity. There is a revenue uplift when we are able to sell a cloud module because we become a managed service provider and that takes away costs from on their side for managing an on-prem solution. So we are able to upcharge from that. We haven't discussed what that means in terms of revenue uplift. But -- so one thing just to recognize also is that from a GAAP perspective, cloud revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract, whereas the on-prem revenue, there's more revenue recognized upfront. So this will create more stability in revenue going forward as well.\nMichael Cho: Okay. No. Great. Thanks for all the color there. If I could just switch gears a little bit for my second question. I just want to touch on Verafin. I mean, it seems like revenue growth is accelerating there. I'm just curious the types of conversations that Nasdaq\u2019s happened with clients there. I mean, do you get the sense that the SMB clients are tightening budgets or expanding budgets for these types of solutions in Verafin?\nAdena Friedman: I would say that every bank is facing more and more challenges of fraud and AML. So the fraud side is just a pure -- it's a very easy return on investment calculus because they are losing money to fraud and they have to -- and when they make their clients good on something that's happened in their accounts. So it's a really nice clear return on invested capital when they come in and leverage our solutions. Additionally, it is a cloud-based solution. So they're having to make less of an upfront investment from an infrastructure perspective. And so it's a cleaner kind of, frankly, commitment to us. And then lastly is, we do a really good job of onboarding clients. And so particularly small to medium banks, we have an amazing machine to onboard those clients and bring them up into the system very quickly. For the large scale banks, we're working really well with them to integrate or implement and integrate these solutions. And as you can see, we did have that one expansion contract with the client that just signed OFS (ph) in the beginning of the year. So they took our solution. We've been able to implement it and immediately sort of realizing that they wanted more capabilities from us with the complex investigations. So we see really good opportunity to expand. In the AML side, it's a matter of just a lot of regulatory pressure and frankly, the banks really having a true interest in just making sure they do not have that type of money laundering going through their systems. And so again, it's an increasing threat. It's become more complex. Our systems are more advanced than many others. We use a lot of AI in the algorithms to root out criminals. We're able to show much -- many fewer false positives and more activity found than our competitors, and it's just driving a lot of good conversations and demand. So we're -- I really do think -- also the last thing I would say is, when I go to these conferences and I have gone to meetings with small banks, and I have had banks come up to me and say Verafin is by far their favorite partner. They just -- they find that we're a really good partner, and they use that word as opposed to vendor. And I think that that's really a testament to the great service that the Verafin team provides to the clients.\nMichael Cho: Great. Thank you so much, Adena.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. So now that you have line of sight to deal closure and you have a bit more clarity on the interest rate environment and where your stock is trading, just wanted to revisit the topic of capital allocation after the deal closure. How should we think about capital priorities, specifically on deleveraging versus buyback, post deal closure? And is there any framework you could provide for maybe level of buybacks anticipated for a specific period post deal closure that could kind of help frame the mix there?\nAdena Friedman: Ann?\nAnn Dennison: Sure. Hi, Kyle. Absolutely. So, as we think about post deal closure, obviously, we will evaluate the market conditions from a share repurchase perspective. But in terms of our capital priorities, first and foremost, we are going to continue to invest to drive the business organically. But after that, our priority is to deleverage and to meet the deleveraging targets that we set out when we announced the Adenza acquisition. And then beyond that, we -- our next priority will be to increase our dividends to get our payout ratio up to the 35% to 38% ratio over the next three to five years. And then beyond that, what's left over, we're going to use to offset the dilution, both from our employee share issuances and then also from the issuance related to the Adenza deal. And our cash flows remain very strong. I mentioned we had $1.6 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. So we feel really well positioned to do all of those things in the priority order that I listed.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. Understood. Thank you for that. And Adena, I mean, you mentioned some of the drivers for the strong kind of high-teens growth for Adenza ARR. Just given the nature of the Adenza business, kind of the length of the sales cycle there and the progress that you've seen since the deal announcement in June, just wondering, if you could provide any updates on -- do you feel more or less confident in kind of that medium term -- low to mid-teens medium-term revenue growth target for Adenza as we look out and for 2024, specifically?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. So we don't, as you know, provide anything specific to a year. But our medium-term outlook of low to mid-teens revenue growth across the Adenza business, and that would be ARR plus the customer delivery revenue. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve that once Adenza becomes part of Nasdaq. I think, as I mentioned, there continues to be a really nice strong demand generally for the solutions. And then also, I think that they've really been able to show the ability to upsell the clients. So the fact they're signing more new clients this year than last year just gives us more upsell capability over time. And the environment is -- these are kind of need to have solutions from banks. I think that, particularly as we're managing through an increasingly complex regulatory environment, there\u2019s more risk in the system than there has been in the past, pretty risk and other things that \u2013 and also across currents across asset classes, they really are driving demand for the solution. So over the medium-term outlook, our medium-term outlook remains the same at that low to mid-teens overall revenue growth.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks, Adena.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about Verafin. I was hoping you could speak to the competitive environment today for Verafin, how you see that evolving. Understand there's big tech companies, such as Google, that have introduced some AML solutions. So maybe you could speak to how your solution differs, talk about some of the steps you're taking to stay ahead of the big tech competitors that have deep pockets in AI expertise?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yeah. So I think that there is a difference between what Google is doing and what we're doing. So Google is partnering with a specific bank and providing AI algorithms to support that internal bank's -- essentially think of it as like an internal build but leveraging Google's infrastructure. So the bank is bringing to that relationship very specific algorithms and patterns of that they're looking for, what we call agents. And so that really is kind of what I would say, more of a facilitated on -- a facilitated bespoke build, but with the Google -- underpinning the Google infrastructure and you're right, in the benefit of their AI capabilities. What we do is a purpose built complete software solution that is purpose built for the needs of fraud and AML detection, investigation and reporting. And so we provide an end-to-end solution. The fact that we have transaction data across 2,500 banks, and we also -- we are a cloud-based solutions. So we're able to bring all of that transaction data together. And we leverage AWS. So AWS is our cloud provider. We're leveraging their AI capabilities and their AI engines, including the bedrock solution that we're using for the Gen AI capabilities that we're adding. I think that it allows us to benefit from another great large technology company. But we have built a purpose built solution that is scaled across 2,500 banks. And so it makes it to the bank doesn't have to do their own bespoke build. We are benefiting from the knowledge across all of these banks and the experience in what they're seeing to continue to tune our engines and to build out the solutions. And the last thing I would say is, we do weekly releases. And so we're always staying on touch with the banks as to what they're seeing and bringing those agents into the system that then benefits all of our clients, not just one client. So we're really -- we do think it's a different -- it's certainly a different sale than it would be to look at -- as compared to what Google is doing with that one bank. The last thing I would say is, we are winning share and we're winning in terms of taking out internal builds because of the benefit of the consortium data that we have and the really nice workflow solution and we're also taking out competitors. So we're really pleased with the momentum.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up question, if I could, just on Verafin. FedNow just launched in July a new real-time payments rail. But there's some concerns around fraud that might limit the uptake by institutions. So can you just speak to Verafin's real-time payment solution, how you see the opportunity set evolving there? And any sort of lessons learned from the clearing houses real-time payment service that's been in place for some time and I believe you have a solution there as well?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. Actually, we do. We connect with FedNow. We connect with the clearing house. So we are rolling out a real-time payment solution. And we've been in contact with the Fed in the context of their rollout. We've been working with the big banks, the core banking system providers because they also -- they provide core infrastructure to the banks to be able to integrate FedNow and other real-time payment solution. So we've been working with them to make sure we're integrated into their solutions and make it easy for the banks to onboard us for fraud detection. So it's definitely -- that is actually a specific growth area that we're engaged with our SMB banks, our small to medium banks on as we speak.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first touch on the pickup in IPO activity. So it was really nice to see a high win way at Nasdaq this quarter, including several big IPOs. But since then, we've seen the markets pull back, rates rise. Now I know you mentioned you have a robust pipeline, but how is the recent macro, including the conflict in Israel impacted the near-term pipeline?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. It's a great question, Craig. It has impacted it. So I think I would say what -- how would you characterize '22 and '23? It's been -- we're coming off of a very significant environment in, what I would call a free money environment, coming into an environment that with rising interest rates, which creates unpredictability of the future, an economy that seems to have a lot of resilience, but is still slowing down and a lot of unpredictability that investors are struggling with, because at the end of the day, they have to underwrite the future earnings of a company, and if they can't understand the overall economic environment it's hard to underwrite that risk. So I would say '23 started with a pretty deep frost (ph). We started to see some light green shoots, as Nelson, likes to say, as we went through the spring or as the interest rate environment became a little bit more known. But the fact is that it kind of fits and starts. So we'll have a window open and we obviously had some really interesting companies come out in September. And then you're starting to see the macro environment change again, the geopolitical environment become much more unstable. And that, of course, is making investors pause again on understanding how to take that risk. So we do actually have a really good pipeline of companies. We're really, really proud of the team. I mean, our team is just awesome. And so they're really working hard to work with clients. But the majority of the conversations we're having with clients, not all of them, but the majority are about the first half of next year much more so than the second -- than the fourth quarter of this year.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Adena. And just for my follow-up also on a similar topic, can you remind us what percentage of your data and listings revenue is coming from initial listings? And can you quantify the headwinds from roll-offs from accrued revenue from that strong 2021 and '20 IPO period?\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. Again, a good question to understand kind of the dynamics in the listings business. So I don't know the exact percentage of revenue that's coming from new listings. Because just to remind everyone, we have our annual listing fees and then we have our initial listing fees. Our initial listing fees are amortized over a two to four-year period -- two to six-year period, I think, depending on the type of listing it is, and how big it is. So you're right that there is some initial listing revenue that's rolling off in -- from the 2021 listings, not all, but some as that amortization flows through, and that will come off in '24. The answer is around 10% of our overall listing revenues, so -- which is and the listing revenue is somewhere in the range of...\nAnn Dennison: Year-to-date, $300 million.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah, $300 million. So it's -- that revenue will have some fluctuation as you go into 2024. And so you've got to look at the combination of the new listings and as well as from an annual listing fee revenue perspective, the de-listings that we're experiencing, we do provide you that data every quarter, as we think about what the billing cycle is going to look like in January for the annual fees. So those are the big factors to consider in '24.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So your organic growth of the Solution Businesses accelerated and come back to your medium to long-term outlook. You talked about the strength in Index and anti-fin crime business. I'm just wondering, if the equity market, Verafin and other business remain stable in the near term and IPO market remain like muted (ph), how should investors think about your organic growth over the next few quarters excluding Adenza? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Hey, Owen. Well, I mean, we don't give specific guidance or specific outlook quarter-by-quarter or year-over-year. But I think that you're right that we're really pleased to see the Solutions Businesses revenue growth really returning into the medium-term outlook that we're -- we have been communicating to you all for a while now. And I think, Owen, if we have a healthy IPO environment, and that really starts to -- that engine starts to turn on again in '24, I think that you'll see the primary benefit of that will actually start to happen in '25 just because it then outflows into our annual listing fees. But beyond that, if we have a stable and healthy trading environment, listing environment, that then obviously drives really good index flows, it drives data demand. And it also probably loosens up and makes it so that corporates and investors are more ready to invest in their new solutions that help automate a lot of the manual processes they have. So it could -- that could continue to unlock more interest, and frankly, easier sales decisions in that space. When it comes to Market Tech and Anti-Fin Crime though, those are really good solid demand businesses where exchanges are very, very focused on bringing their technology into the future, and we now have -- I think we've done a nice job of really getting to a state of maturity across our CSD solution, our next-gen clearing solution, our next-gen trading solution, so -- and our risk management solutions there. So we feel like that demand driver is more stable generally. And then anti-fin crime is just -- as you know, it's a need to have technology, and we do think we have the best technology available. So that demand, we just feel like is much -- is very structural. So I can't say, Owen, exactly what that means for Solutions Business growth. But having a healthy -- general healthy market environment certainly helps create even more opportunity for us.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's helpful. And a quick one on the sales cycle on Adenza. I mean, we have been talking about the elongated sales cycle. I'm just wondering, is there any like sales cycle impact on Adenza? I mean, you talked about high-teens growth, I think, for Adenza in the third quarter. I'm just wondering, if there's no, like, elongated sales cycle, the budget gets hike (ph) in release or things like that, how high it could have gone? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yeah. I actually do think that there are more gates that are -- all of the larger institutions have a lot of gates to walk through. And I think that our Anti-Fin Crime business, we're marching through these gates, but the gates -- there are many gates, and we have great experience in the past especially with our Surveillance business, to kind of understand that. But with Adenza, there are more gates that they're walking through to get to a sale, particularly with the larger institutions, except when there's a regulatory demand. And that's what we're really interesting. I mean, we've had some really interesting super regionals sign up for Axiom like within three months or four months, that's been some really shorter -- some really short sales cycles when there's a regulatory demand. But if there isn't really a near-term or immediate regulatory demand, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. I think they actually experienced longer sales cycles in '22 than they're experiencing in '23. But generally speaking, they -- I think that if we had a really healthy macro environment around us and more predictability of the macro environment, it would certainly be advantageous to Adenza over time.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just back on Verafin. Just in terms of the normal seasonality we have seen in the last couple of years in that business, or I should say Anti-Financial Crime broadly, do you expect that also to represent the past pattern over the last two years in the fourth quarter? And then just sort of confidence around that 20% plus type of growth rate that you've been able to achieve in that going into 2024?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Well, generally, we do see the -- I think it's somewhere in the range like 40% of bookings occurs in the fourth quarter for our Anti-Financial Crime business and we would say that, that's generally what we're seeing. And so we -- now the difference, though is that if we, when we do upsell to the largest banks, there's a little bit of that's not necessarily seasonal, and we don't have as much experience there. So we're not seeing -- that's not something that every single fourth quarter, we're going to see something different. But certainly with the small and medium banks, which is the core business of the anti-fin crime business so far, the fourth quarter is a big sales quarter. And that's actually the case for Adenza as well, kind of 40% to 45% of bookings tend to come in the fourth quarter. In terms of just the general growth characteristics of the anti-fin crime business, we're very pleased with the progress. We continue to see good opportunity to continue to grow in that 18% to 23% growth rate that we've been experiencing.\nBrian Bedell: No. Good to see the progress there. And then, Adena, maybe if you could just update us on the status of the SEC market structure proposals. I know it's a big debate in the industry and there's a lot of back and forth on that. But do you see anything being potentially implemented in 2024 or do you think it's -- the debate will sort of linger on at least into '25?\nAdena Friedman: I think that on the four proposals that the SEC has proposed, I would expect that we'll see something come out to be -- to start to get implemented as we go through 2024. We don't know what that's going to look like yet. I think they've had a lot of comments on the proposals. And I think that in general, the two that seem very -- that feel a little bit more certain are the tick sizes and the 605. Those two proposals feel quite certain. I think that on the best decks and the order competition rule, those are ones that have engendered a lot more debate within the industry. So we don\u2019t know exactly how that\u2019s going to turn out.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, Adena. Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if we jump back to Adenza again and just your comments about your preparations for integration. Obviously, this is a large transaction, and it's one that you're actually going to be fully integrating to the business. I was wondering, if you could give us an update on, I guess, what the puts and takes are to this plan, and ultimately, how to think about the technology stack and what that -- what the integration of that of Adenza into your existing cloud infrastructure really means for the expense base and margins of that business going forward?\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks. Well, I can say that Tal and the entire team has been extremely focused on building out a very robust integration plan. We've been engaged with the Adenza team now for several months, and we're having regular engagement with them to develop those plans and make sure that we feel really good about how we're going to kick off the integration on day one. And we built a lot more granularity to the plan and we still obviously don't own them. So once we own them and we're able to meet more people and really understand the operations, we'll be able to flesh that out into a great amount of detail. But we're extremely committed to achieving the integration, our expectations that we delivered to you all at the announcement. We also definitely see benefit in the cloud infrastructure that we have. That's actually part of our integration. We have not done a lot of detailed work yet on that because we don't own them. We have a lot of, in my opinion, proprietary IP when it comes to our cloud capabilities and our cloud team. So we want to make sure that we own them before we go into really, really deep dives on the technical infrastructure. But our relationship with AWS, we think will be a benefit. I think the expertise that we have in creating very efficient cloud infrastructure, particularly from a data ingress/egress (ph) perspective, I think it's going to be very helpful. And so we look forward to really working with them to continue to develop this cloud capabilities. I have a great view of -- in five years, like how do we want these services to be delivered, how much do we want to have a single-tenant, multi-tenant capabilities, what kind of overall or overarching environment do we want to create for our clients so they see us as a strategic partner across risk management, reg tech, anti-fin crime, capital markets? There's a lot that we can do there, but we have to get in there, we have to own them. We have to kind of get really engage with them so that we can give you a better answer to that in the coming months and quarters.\nSimon Clinch: That's great. Thanks, Adena. I guess just a second question here and just changing tack a little bit. Just on the cash equities business, I've noticed that the revenue capture has been rising quite substantially while the sort of market volumes have stagnated have fallen. And I know some of this has to do with mix, but I was wondering, if you could expand a little bit on sort of what the dynamics are there. And is this a deliberate sort of management on your part to, I guess, smooth out revenue by taking a bit more pricing when times slow down or how should we think about that strategy going forward?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I think one of the things we've always said is that we like to make sure that we have a good balance between share and capture. And one of the things we've been focused on is, what is our share of available liquidity? And Ann mentioned before, we've been able to manage to a pretty stable share of available liquidity and what do we mean by that? In times when volatility goes down, there tends to be more trading that occurs off exchange. So the off-exchange trading percentage tends to go up. So then we look at it and say, well, what can we actually achieve and bring into the exchange and how are we competing with other exchanges? And there, we look at what we call available liquidity. And I think we've maintained a pretty stable share of about 30%. And then within that, we then said, hey, what kind of volumes are we trying to attract into our solution? We want to attract volumes that are additive to overall volumes in the platform. So one, certain orders that come into the market feed other orders, and we're going to work hard to get those orders in. The other thing is we provide a lot of really interesting, as we mentioned, specialized order types that also allow us to charge different rates for these services because they're specialized execution capabilities, and that allows us to have a higher capture. But the one thing we don't do is just chase share that just is fleeting, that if you chase that share, you can really have a significant negative impact on capture, and frankly, not get share that's additive to the NBBO (ph) not get share that brings other on their volume in. So we're very, very intentional about that, and that's why you're seeing some capture go up because more of the volumes moving towards our specialized capabilities, and we're not doing what others of our competitors are doing in terms of chasing fleeting share.\nSimon Clinch: That\u2019s great. Thanks so much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you. Well, we are excited to continue to update all of you in the coming quarters as we approach the closing of the Adenza transaction and we continue to advance along our journey to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And so thank you very much, and have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for Nasdaq's third quarter earnings call. Before I begin, I would like to offer brief comment on the situation in the Middle East. We were horrified by the acts of terrorist violence that occurred in Israel last week, and we were deeply saddened by the subsequent loss of innocent lives in Israel, Gaza and the wider region. Our focus has been on supporting our people and our clients with connections in the region. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and stay engaged with them throughout this emerging crisis. Turning now to my remarks about the quarter. I will start by covering Nasdaq's performance and how our strategy is unfolding in the context of the current operating environment, as well as provide key business highlights. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a detailed review of our financial results. I'm pleased to share that Nasdaq continues to make solid progress in our strategic objectives to capitalize on the key megatrends shaping the financial system. Nasdaq continues to execute against the strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the global financial system, delivering broad-based growth across our businesses, including 6% overall net revenue growth and 8% year-over-year organic revenue growth in our Solutions Businesses. I'm proud of the team's efforts to continue to serve our clients and I'm pleased to see our revenue growth improving in the third quarter, aided by strong performance in our Capital Access Platforms division, particularly in our Index business. In addition, our Anti-Financial Crime division delivered -- continued to deliver strong results with solid growth in our Surveillance business and Verafin continuing to demonstrate strong new customer growth, as well as an expansion contract with the Tier 2 clients. With respect to the market backdrop, during the quarter, we saw variety of cross currents, including increasing market volatility, fluctuating equities markets and rising long-term interest rates. Nevertheless, we experienced modestly improving momentum in our Listings business amid a gradual re-emergence of the U.S. IPO activity with 35 operating companies choosing to list in Nasdaq during the quarter. Based on our client conversations and our growing IPO pipeline, we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the upcoming year. Across the company, as we've discussed before, Nasdaq is well-positioned to thrive by capitalizing on three key megatrends that are shaping the financial system: the modernization of markets, the development of the corporate and investor ecosystem for environmental sustainability, and the increasing need for integrity solutions across the financial system, including risk management, surveillance, regulatory compliance and anti-financial crime technology. By aligning our business to these key megatrends, we're unlocking attractive opportunities for sustainable growth and we're building a diversified business that's well-positioned to succeed through economic cycles. In this regard, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter that illustrate the progress we're making to capitalize on these growth opportunities. First, our focus on market modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. A major driver of that innovation has been our ability to adopt and leverage technologies, including cloud and artificial intelligence across our markets and in our products. In the third quarter, we are pleased to announce the approval by the SEC of the first exchange AI-powered order type, which we call Dynamic Midpoint Extended Life Order or Dynamic M-ELO. For the last several years, we've offered an order type called the Midpoint Extended Life Order for clients seeking larger trade sizes at the midpoint. The order introduces a fixed holding period together order interest before execution. Through extensive testing and consultation, we determined that our clients trade execution could be improved under certain market conditions by applying adaptable holding periods. This led to the creation of Dynamic M-ELO, which leverages AI to adjust the length of holding periods throughout the trading day on a stock-by-stock basis to improved fill rates and reduce market friction. We're very excited to rollout this enhanced order type to our clients in the coming months. And we see significant opportunity ahead to drive the application of AI and other emerging technologies across our markets. Next, regarding the development of the environmental sustainable ecosystem, during the quarter, we were proud to launch two new offerings designed to help corporates and investors streamline their sustainability journeys. Following the acquisition of Metrio last year, we have integrated Nasdaq's OneReport and Metrio's sustainability reporting and workflow offerings into a single solution called Nasdaq Metrio, which was officially launched during the quarter. Nasdaq Metrio is a SaaS based end-to-end solution that helps corporates better collect, measure and report sustainability data on a single platform. In addition, in our Investment Intelligence business, we announced the launch of Nasdaq eVestment ESG Analytics, which is designed to help asset managers better quantify and showcase the environmental, social and/or governance impact of our portfolio's position in the market. It enables asset managers to demonstrate their portfolio's sustainability strategies to asset owners, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and endowments. These two solutions underscore our role as a bridge between corporates and investors by creating market-based demand driven solutions that help bring clarity to a rapidly evolving environment for sustainability reporting. Lastly, looking at the increasing need for integrity solutions, including risk management and anti-financial crime technology, we're developing innovations that make our clients anti-money laundering or AML programs more efficient. Specifically, in October, we have launched the beta version of an AML workflow to co-pilot tool that will leverage generative AI to automate portions of our clients' AML processes. We look forward to updating you on our progress with these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to leverage technology to advance our clients' evolving needs. Turning next to our results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the third quarter of 2023. We achieved $940 million net revenues, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year period, an increase of 5% on an organic basis. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $694 million, up 9% from the prior year period and 8% on an organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million in the third quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 37% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $456 million in total revenue in the third quarter, an 8% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 15% from the prior year period. The performance in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance, $24 billion in net inflows over the past 12 months, including $5 million in the third quarter and strong features capture, partially offset by lower derivatives volumes. Our Workflow and Insights revenues grew 5% over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for project work in our ESG Solutions and steady analytics solutions sales to asset managers. While we continue to see elongated sales cycles for certain products in this business, we've not seen a material improvement or worsening of sales cycles from the second quarter of 2023. Our Data and Listing Services revenues grew 5%. Our Listings revenues was largely unchanged due to continued muted IPO activity and heightened de-listings, while our Data business delivered continued strong revenue growth, driven by demand from international data clients. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings, ending the quarter with strong momentum from some of the year's biggest IPOs by proceeds raised. Year-to-date, Nasdaq welcomed 83 new operating company IPOs for an 84% win rate. As of the end of the third quarter, we have welcomed four of the five top IPOs by capital raised. And in the third quarter, we achieved an overall win rate of 95% and welcomed several marquee IPOs including Arm Holdings and Instacart. This momentum was also bolstered by several notable listing switches to Nasdaq in the quarter, including DoorDash and Roper Technologies. Overall, 11 companies had transfered to Nasdaq year-to-date, representing a total market value of $184 billion. The September Listing success coincides with the launch of our new IPO and Broadcast Center at the Nasdaq MarketSite in Times Square, further establishing Nasdaq as the world's premier venue for listings. The reimagined space reflects our commitment to showcasing our clients and elevating their IPO experience, and enables us to create more visibility for first trade celebrations through increased access to global media outlets. Looking ahead, we remain well-positioned to capture new listings activity. We have a strong pipeline of companies who are committed to Nasdaq and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO timelines. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $381 million in total revenues during the third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. In our Trading business, revenues declined 1% compared to the prior year, with lower European revenue, partially offset by modest growth in U.S. equities revenue due to higher revenue capture and a small FX benefit. In our Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 4% with growth in both trade management services and market technology solutions. During the period, we completed delivery of a major CSD project for a Latin American central securities depository and signed a contract extension, including an upgrade to our next-gen trading system with one of the largest stock exchanges in Southeast Asia. Turning next to a brief update on Adenza. We're progressing well towards the closing of the Adenza transaction. We have completed the anti-trust review and Thoma Bravo is on track to obtain the remaining approvals from the Nordic and Baltic financial regulators to become a major shareholder in Nasdaq. Therefore, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023. As previously disclosed, this business will be reported as part of the newly created Financial Technology division, alongside our Marketplace Technology and Anti-Financial Crime businesses. In the third quarter, Adenza continued its strong performance, delivering constant currency ARR growth in the high-teens. Year-to-date through the third quarter, they added 17 new clients and three total cross-sells, which compares to seven new clients and three cross-sells over the same period last year. Additionally, Adenza maintains solid growth in net revenue retention at 97.4% and 113%, respectively. We're also pleased with the momentum of Adenza's journey towards the cloud-based delivery of its solutions across both existing and new clients. Through the first three quarters of 2023, 55% of bookings have been for cloud delivery solutions versus 27% over the same period last year. Since the transaction was announced in June, we've held extensive integration and planning discussions with the leadership team at Adenza, and we're very excited about the opportunities ahead. As a result of our early interactions together, we have developed a very clear path and process for integration that we intend to execute successfully starting on day one post-close. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division. We delivered $93 million in total revenue during the third quarter, a 21% increase in the prior year period. Nasdaq Verafin grew 29% primarily driven by growth in the adoption of our Fraud and Anti-Money Laundering or FRAML solutions by small and medium sized banks, as well as an expansion of wallet share among existing clients. We continue to expand client relationships with 47 new small-medium sized financial institutions adopting our FRAML solutions. Additionally, we continue to have momentum in our move-up market. This quarter, we signed an expansion agreement with an existing Tier 2 bank client. Specifically, this is a bank client that's signed on to our Fraud Detection and Workflow solution in the first quarter of 2023 and is now expanded their relationship with us to include our complex investigations solution. We view this expansion as a strong proof point and our ability to land and expand our relationships with large bank clients. We continue to be actively engaged in contract negotiations and proof-of-concepts with several Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, and remain on track with our plans to sign additional large banks in the coming quarters. Our Surveillance business delivered 9% organic revenue growth with continued new customer growth including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers as we expanded our leadership position with large customers. And lastly, I'm pleased to announce that we've officially named Brendan Brothers, Executive Vice President of our Anti-Financial Crime division. As you may recall, Brendan was named to the role on an interim basis earlier this year and we're thrilled to welcome him formally as a member of our leadership team continuing to report directly to me. To wrap-up, our third quarter results demonstrate the strength of our diversified business and reflect our strong position going into year-end with the closing of the Adenza transaction view. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details. Thank you, Ann. And before we turn to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Ann Dennison. After eight years at Nasdaq, Ann will be stepping down from her role as CFO at the end of this year. Ann has been a guiding voice to the market on our financial performance, a leader in enhancing our Investor Relations and ESG reporting efforts, and as steward to our company's transformation, most recently, through our announced acquisition of Adenza. In conjunction with Ann's upcoming departure from Nasdaq, we're pleased to welcome Sarah Youngwood as our next EVP and CFO. Sarah will join us from UBS Group, where she served as CFO and a Group Executive Board member. Sarah will officially join us on December 1, and will work closely with Ann and the team to ensure a seamless transition. I want to thank Ann personally for her many contributions to Nasdaq. She has been a phenomenal partner to me and the company, and we wish her the very best. And now, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A. Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we don't provide or break out the financial, the revenue differences between Axiom and Calypso. But we do provide -- I can give you some color in that, when we're looking at new bookings for the year, we had -- as I mentioned, we had 17 new clients so far in 2020 or I should say they have 17 new clients so far in 2023 and three cross-sells. And when we break that out between Calypso and Axiom, so Calypso had nine new clients sign up and one cross-sell; and Axiom had eight new clients sign up and two cross-sells. And then in terms of the upsells, 95 total and it's really a good even split, 55% upsells in Calypso and 40 in Axiom. So it's really a nice split of revenue growth and opportunity across both of these solutions. When we think about why that is the case, I think that there are a range of reasons, just trends out in the marketplace that are driving demand for both risk management solutions, more advanced risk management solutions for -- across all asset classes, as well as better regulatory reporting solutions. And obviously, those are the two great things that Calypso and Axiom do. And when we think about that acceleration of new sales because they had seven new sales -- new clients sign up last year versus 17 this year, we're definitely seeing a momentum in terms of the regulatory obligations that are coming into the United States as well as the Basel III end game that's really coming across both the U.S. and Europe driving certain demand, but then also moving down market. I mean I think Axiom did a really nice job of bringing in even more banks and brokers into their solutions. So generally, it's just -- we're very pleased with the continued momentum in the business. When it comes to cloud, it's really interesting to see. As I mentioned, the 55% of total bookings were for cloud -- I'm sorry, new bookings were for cloud delivery solutions versus 27%, I think it was last year. And that's really, I think, a combination of two things. One is the fact that banks are more ready to accept cloud delivered solutions. And so that's been a real -- we've seen that across all of our solutions across Nasdaq. They're just more ready to have cloud be a big part of their infrastructure. And they're trying to -- some banks are purposely trying to move out their data centers. I think that the second is that the cloud based delivery solutions are modern. They're modular, they're more flexible. And I think that the team has done a really nice job of selling the benefits of that and you're right in terms of the revenue opportunity. There is a revenue uplift when we are able to sell a cloud module because we become a managed service provider and that takes away costs from on their side for managing an on-prem solution. So we are able to upcharge from that. We haven't discussed what that means in terms of revenue uplift. But -- so one thing just to recognize also is that from a GAAP perspective, cloud revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the contract, whereas the on-prem revenue, there's more revenue recognized upfront. So this will create more stability in revenue going forward as well. I would say that every bank is facing more and more challenges of fraud and AML. So the fraud side is just a pure -- it's a very easy return on investment calculus because they are losing money to fraud and they have to -- and when they make their clients good on something that's happened in their accounts. So it's a really nice clear return on invested capital when they come in and leverage our solutions. Additionally, it is a cloud-based solution. So they're having to make less of an upfront investment from an infrastructure perspective. And so it's a cleaner kind of, frankly, commitment to us. And then lastly is, we do a really good job of onboarding clients. And so particularly small to medium banks, we have an amazing machine to onboard those clients and bring them up into the system very quickly. For the large scale banks, we're working really well with them to integrate or implement and integrate these solutions. And as you can see, we did have that one expansion contract with the client that just signed OFS (ph) in the beginning of the year. So they took our solution. We've been able to implement it and immediately sort of realizing that they wanted more capabilities from us with the complex investigations. So we see really good opportunity to expand. In the AML side, it's a matter of just a lot of regulatory pressure and frankly, the banks really having a true interest in just making sure they do not have that type of money laundering going through their systems. And so again, it's an increasing threat. It's become more complex. Our systems are more advanced than many others. We use a lot of AI in the algorithms to root out criminals. We're able to show much -- many fewer false positives and more activity found than our competitors, and it's just driving a lot of good conversations and demand. So we're -- I really do think -- also the last thing I would say is, when I go to these conferences and I have gone to meetings with small banks, and I have had banks come up to me and say Verafin is by far their favorite partner. They just -- they find that we're a really good partner, and they use that word as opposed to vendor. And I think that that's really a testament to the great service that the Verafin team provides to the clients. Ann? Yeah. So we don't, as you know, provide anything specific to a year. But our medium-term outlook of low to mid-teens revenue growth across the Adenza business, and that would be ARR plus the customer delivery revenue. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve that once Adenza becomes part of Nasdaq. I think, as I mentioned, there continues to be a really nice strong demand generally for the solutions. And then also, I think that they've really been able to show the ability to upsell the clients. So the fact they're signing more new clients this year than last year just gives us more upsell capability over time. And the environment is -- these are kind of need to have solutions from banks. I think that, particularly as we're managing through an increasingly complex regulatory environment, there's more risk in the system than there has been in the past, pretty risk and other things that \u2013 and also across currents across asset classes, they really are driving demand for the solution. So over the medium-term outlook, our medium-term outlook remains the same at that low to mid-teens overall revenue growth. Sure. Yeah. So I think that there is a difference between what Google is doing and what we're doing. So Google is partnering with a specific bank and providing AI algorithms to support that internal bank's -- essentially think of it as like an internal build but leveraging Google's infrastructure. So the bank is bringing to that relationship very specific algorithms and patterns of that they're looking for, what we call agents. And so that really is kind of what I would say, more of a facilitated on -- a facilitated bespoke build, but with the Google -- underpinning the Google infrastructure and you're right, in the benefit of their AI capabilities. What we do is a purpose built complete software solution that is purpose built for the needs of fraud and AML detection, investigation and reporting. And so we provide an end-to-end solution. The fact that we have transaction data across 2,500 banks, and we also -- we are a cloud-based solutions. So we're able to bring all of that transaction data together. And we leverage AWS. So AWS is our cloud provider. We're leveraging their AI capabilities and their AI engines, including the bedrock solution that we're using for the Gen AI capabilities that we're adding. I think that it allows us to benefit from another great large technology company. But we have built a purpose built solution that is scaled across 2,500 banks. And so it makes it to the bank doesn't have to do their own bespoke build. We are benefiting from the knowledge across all of these banks and the experience in what they're seeing to continue to tune our engines and to build out the solutions. And the last thing I would say is, we do weekly releases. And so we're always staying on touch with the banks as to what they're seeing and bringing those agents into the system that then benefits all of our clients, not just one client. So we're really -- we do think it's a different -- it's certainly a different sale than it would be to look at -- as compared to what Google is doing with that one bank. The last thing I would say is, we are winning share and we're winning in terms of taking out internal builds because of the benefit of the consortium data that we have and the really nice workflow solution and we're also taking out competitors. So we're really pleased with the momentum. Yeah. Actually, we do. We connect with FedNow. We connect with the clearing house. So we are rolling out a real-time payment solution. And we've been in contact with the Fed in the context of their rollout. We've been working with the big banks, the core banking system providers because they also -- they provide core infrastructure to the banks to be able to integrate FedNow and other real-time payment solution. So we've been working with them to make sure we're integrated into their solutions and make it easy for the banks to onboard us for fraud detection. So it's definitely -- that is actually a specific growth area that we're engaged with our SMB banks, our small to medium banks on as we speak. Yeah. It's a great question, Craig. It has impacted it. So I think I would say what -- how would you characterize '22 and '23? It's been -- we're coming off of a very significant environment in, what I would call a free money environment, coming into an environment that with rising interest rates, which creates unpredictability of the future, an economy that seems to have a lot of resilience, but is still slowing down and a lot of unpredictability that investors are struggling with, because at the end of the day, they have to underwrite the future earnings of a company, and if they can't understand the overall economic environment it's hard to underwrite that risk. So I would say '23 started with a pretty deep frost (ph). We started to see some light green shoots, as Nelson, likes to say, as we went through the spring or as the interest rate environment became a little bit more known. But the fact is that it kind of fits and starts. So we'll have a window open and we obviously had some really interesting companies come out in September. And then you're starting to see the macro environment change again, the geopolitical environment become much more unstable. And that, of course, is making investors pause again on understanding how to take that risk. So we do actually have a really good pipeline of companies. We're really, really proud of the team. I mean, our team is just awesome. And so they're really working hard to work with clients. But the majority of the conversations we're having with clients, not all of them, but the majority are about the first half of next year much more so than the second -- than the fourth quarter of this year. Yeah. Again, a good question to understand kind of the dynamics in the listings business. So I don't know the exact percentage of revenue that's coming from new listings. Because just to remind everyone, we have our annual listing fees and then we have our initial listing fees. Our initial listing fees are amortized over a two to four-year period -- two to six-year period, I think, depending on the type of listing it is, and how big it is. So you're right that there is some initial listing revenue that's rolling off in -- from the 2021 listings, not all, but some as that amortization flows through, and that will come off in '24. The answer is around 10% of our overall listing revenues, so -- which is and the listing revenue is somewhere in the range of... Yeah, $300 million. So it's -- that revenue will have some fluctuation as you go into 2024. And so you've got to look at the combination of the new listings and as well as from an annual listing fee revenue perspective, the de-listings that we're experiencing, we do provide you that data every quarter, as we think about what the billing cycle is going to look like in January for the annual fees. So those are the big factors to consider in '24. Sure. Sure. Hey, Owen. Well, I mean, we don't give specific guidance or specific outlook quarter-by-quarter or year-over-year. But I think that you're right that we're really pleased to see the Solutions Businesses revenue growth really returning into the medium-term outlook that we're -- we have been communicating to you all for a while now. And I think, Owen, if we have a healthy IPO environment, and that really starts to -- that engine starts to turn on again in '24, I think that you'll see the primary benefit of that will actually start to happen in '25 just because it then outflows into our annual listing fees. But beyond that, if we have a stable and healthy trading environment, listing environment, that then obviously drives really good index flows, it drives data demand. And it also probably loosens up and makes it so that corporates and investors are more ready to invest in their new solutions that help automate a lot of the manual processes they have. So it could -- that could continue to unlock more interest, and frankly, easier sales decisions in that space. When it comes to Market Tech and Anti-Fin Crime though, those are really good solid demand businesses where exchanges are very, very focused on bringing their technology into the future, and we now have -- I think we've done a nice job of really getting to a state of maturity across our CSD solution, our next-gen clearing solution, our next-gen trading solution, so -- and our risk management solutions there. So we feel like that demand driver is more stable generally. And then anti-fin crime is just -- as you know, it's a need to have technology, and we do think we have the best technology available. So that demand, we just feel like is much -- is very structural. So I can't say, Owen, exactly what that means for Solutions Business growth. But having a healthy -- general healthy market environment certainly helps create even more opportunity for us. Yeah. I actually do think that there are more gates that are -- all of the larger institutions have a lot of gates to walk through. And I think that our Anti-Fin Crime business, we're marching through these gates, but the gates -- there are many gates, and we have great experience in the past especially with our Surveillance business, to kind of understand that. But with Adenza, there are more gates that they're walking through to get to a sale, particularly with the larger institutions, except when there's a regulatory demand. And that's what we're really interesting. I mean, we've had some really interesting super regionals sign up for Axiom like within three months or four months, that's been some really shorter -- some really short sales cycles when there's a regulatory demand. But if there isn't really a near-term or immediate regulatory demand, the sales cycle is a little bit longer. I think they actually experienced longer sales cycles in '22 than they're experiencing in '23. But generally speaking, they -- I think that if we had a really healthy macro environment around us and more predictability of the macro environment, it would certainly be advantageous to Adenza over time. Sure Great. Well, generally, we do see the -- I think it's somewhere in the range like 40% of bookings occurs in the fourth quarter for our Anti-Financial Crime business and we would say that, that's generally what we're seeing. And so we -- now the difference, though is that if we, when we do upsell to the largest banks, there's a little bit of that's not necessarily seasonal, and we don't have as much experience there. So we're not seeing -- that's not something that every single fourth quarter, we're going to see something different. But certainly with the small and medium banks, which is the core business of the anti-fin crime business so far, the fourth quarter is a big sales quarter. And that's actually the case for Adenza as well, kind of 40% to 45% of bookings tend to come in the fourth quarter. In terms of just the general growth characteristics of the anti-fin crime business, we're very pleased with the progress. We continue to see good opportunity to continue to grow in that 18% to 23% growth rate that we've been experiencing. I think that on the four proposals that the SEC has proposed, I would expect that we'll see something come out to be -- to start to get implemented as we go through 2024. We don't know what that's going to look like yet. I think they've had a lot of comments on the proposals. And I think that in general, the two that seem very -- that feel a little bit more certain are the tick sizes and the 605. Those two proposals feel quite certain. I think that on the best decks and the order competition rule, those are ones that have engendered a lot more debate within the industry. So we don't know exactly how that's going to turn out. Great. Thanks. Well, I can say that Tal and the entire team has been extremely focused on building out a very robust integration plan. We've been engaged with the Adenza team now for several months, and we're having regular engagement with them to develop those plans and make sure that we feel really good about how we're going to kick off the integration on day one. And we built a lot more granularity to the plan and we still obviously don't own them. So once we own them and we're able to meet more people and really understand the operations, we'll be able to flesh that out into a great amount of detail. But we're extremely committed to achieving the integration, our expectations that we delivered to you all at the announcement. We also definitely see benefit in the cloud infrastructure that we have. That's actually part of our integration. We have not done a lot of detailed work yet on that because we don't own them. We have a lot of, in my opinion, proprietary IP when it comes to our cloud capabilities and our cloud team. So we want to make sure that we own them before we go into really, really deep dives on the technical infrastructure. But our relationship with AWS, we think will be a benefit. I think the expertise that we have in creating very efficient cloud infrastructure, particularly from a data ingress/egress (ph) perspective, I think it's going to be very helpful. And so we look forward to really working with them to continue to develop this cloud capabilities. I have a great view of -- in five years, like how do we want these services to be delivered, how much do we want to have a single-tenant, multi-tenant capabilities, what kind of overall or overarching environment do we want to create for our clients so they see us as a strategic partner across risk management, reg tech, anti-fin crime, capital markets? There's a lot that we can do there, but we have to get in there, we have to own them. We have to kind of get really engage with them so that we can give you a better answer to that in the coming months and quarters. Well, I think one of the things we've always said is that we like to make sure that we have a good balance between share and capture. And one of the things we've been focused on is, what is our share of available liquidity? And Ann mentioned before, we've been able to manage to a pretty stable share of available liquidity and what do we mean by that? In times when volatility goes down, there tends to be more trading that occurs off exchange. So the off-exchange trading percentage tends to go up. So then we look at it and say, well, what can we actually achieve and bring into the exchange and how are we competing with other exchanges? And there, we look at what we call available liquidity. And I think we've maintained a pretty stable share of about 30%. And then within that, we then said, hey, what kind of volumes are we trying to attract into our solution? We want to attract volumes that are additive to overall volumes in the platform. So one, certain orders that come into the market feed other orders, and we're going to work hard to get those orders in. The other thing is we provide a lot of really interesting, as we mentioned, specialized order types that also allow us to charge different rates for these services because they're specialized execution capabilities, and that allows us to have a higher capture. But the one thing we don't do is just chase share that just is fleeting, that if you chase that share, you can really have a significant negative impact on capture, and frankly, not get share that's additive to the NBBO (ph) not get share that brings other on their volume in. So we're very, very intentional about that, and that's why you're seeing some capture go up because more of the volumes moving towards our specialized capabilities, and we're not doing what others of our competitors are doing in terms of chasing fleeting share. Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we are excited to continue to update all of you in the coming quarters as we approach the closing of the Adenza transaction and we continue to advance along our journey to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. And so thank you very much, and have a great day. Thank you."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing third quarter 2023 performance, beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 6% increase in reported net revenue of $940 million is the net result of organic growth of 5%, including an 8% organic increase in the Solutions Businesses and slightly lower Trading Services revenue, and $3 million in net positive impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 4%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 90 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $349 million or $0.71 per diluted share compared to $335 million, or $0.68 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12, as Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $773 million, an increase of 11%. ARR and SaaS revenue growth in the quarter reflect broad based growth led by continued bookings strength in our Anti-Financial Crime division. We are delivering solid performance despite ongoing elongated sales cycles in certain areas of our Workflow and Insights business similar to recent quarters. We are working closely with our customers in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment and are executing well on our strategic pillars of bringing liquidity, transparency and integrity to financial markets. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15. Starting with the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $2 million or 1%, driven by a positive impact from changes in FX rates. Trading Services organic revenue was down 2% driven by lower European trading revenues due to lower volumes. Despite better cash equity revenue capture that offset largely flat U.S. revenues. While we have seen an increase in off-exchange trading, which is common in a lower volatility environment, Nasdaq share of available volume has remained steady. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 3% organic revenue growth, reflecting solid revenue growth in our Market Technology business. As a reminder, Marketplace Technology revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery that we don't expect to recur in the second half of the year. We continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium term outlook. ARR totaled $511 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period. This growth rate is lower compared to prior periods due to slower Trade Management Services growth resulting from near term market conditions. Market Platforms operating margin was 52% in the third quarter of 2023, representing a 370 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue, resulting from lower European trading activity, as well as higher compensation costs, ongoing investments related to migrating U.S. markets to the cloud, and investment in new growth opportunities in Marketplace Technology. Turning to Capital Access Platforms. Revenues increased $34 million or 8%, reflecting organic revenue growth of $32 million and a $2 million positive impact from changes in FX rates. We delivered broad based organic growth in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in Index. Index revenue increased 15% compared to the third quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 22% increase in average AUM over the prior year quarter. Licensing revenues for futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index increased 14%, reflecting higher pricing per contract, partially offset by a decline in trading volume. Additionally, we saw in net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $24 billion including $5 billion in the quarter. While AUM has benefited from a strong year-to-date market performance, we saw AUM impacted by overall markets trending lower in the last two months of the quarter. Moving to Data and Listing Services. Our revenue grew 5%; excluding the positive impact from changes in FX rates, our organic growth was 4%. Revenue growth reflects continued strength in our Data business and the combined impact of de-listings and a more muted IPO environment on Listings revenue growth. However, as Adena mentioned, we have seen several high profile initial listings and 11 switches year-to-date. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the third quarter of '22, reflecting growth across our ESG and Analytics businesses, despite ongoing elongated sales cycles with corporates, particularly for our IR tools and for our asset owner portfolio management solutions, affecting revenue growth in the third quarter. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period. While ARR growth related to our data products remained solid, the Capital Access Platforms ARR growth rate has been impacted by slower listings growth and the impacts of continuing elongated sales cycles on parts of our Corporate Solutions and Analytics businesses. The division operating margin was 56% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of roughly 50 basis points from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $16 million or 21% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Growth reflects robust demand for Fraud Detection and Anti-Money Laundering solutions, as well as our SaaS-based Surveillance Solutions. Our Fraud Detection and AML solutions revenues grew 29% compared to the third quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 9% compared to the third quarter of '22 with continued customer growth including Tier 3 banks and retail brokers. These new customer wins reflect our ability to drive growth beyond our leadership position with large banks and expand into new customer segments. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $348 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced totaled $381 million, an increase of 19% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 33% in the third quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period with approximately one half of the margin growth resulting from the timing of recognition of incentive compensation. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $32 million to $449 million. The increase primarily reflects a $32 million organic increase or 8%. The organic year-over-year increase reflects increased compensation and benefits expense due primarily to increased headcount and the impact of merit increases, higher technology spend attributable to continued investment in our business and higher G&A expense. We are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $1.785 billion to $1.805 billion, which is a $10 million reduction to the top end of the guidance range. As a result, the midpoint of the updated expense guidance range is $5 million lower than our prior guidance, which reflects an annual expense increase of approximately 4.5% for 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, we narrowed our full year non-GAAP tax rate guidance range from 24% to 26% to a range of 24.5% to 25.5%. We expect to come in at or around the midpoint of this updated range for the full year. Turning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.4 times, down from 2.6 times at the end of the second quarter of 2023. During the quarter, we paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $108 million. And in September, our Board approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to a total of $2 billion. Our balance sheet remains solid and our cash flow generation is strong, including $1.6 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. We remain well-positioned to support organic growth, execute on the deleveraging plan we announced with the Adenza acquisition, increase our dividend payout ratio over time and repurchase shares to minimize dilution. In closing today, Nasdaq's third quarter results reflect the continuation of the Company's ability to perform consistently well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time and I will turn it back over to Adena. Sure. Hi, Kyle. Absolutely. So, as we think about post deal closure, obviously, we will evaluate the market conditions from a share repurchase perspective. But in terms of our capital priorities, first and foremost, we are going to continue to invest to drive the business organically. But after that, our priority is to deleverage and to meet the deleveraging targets that we set out when we announced the Adenza acquisition. And then beyond that, we -- our next priority will be to increase our dividends to get our payout ratio up to the 35% to 38% ratio over the next three to five years. And then beyond that, what's left over, we're going to use to offset the dilution, both from our employee share issuances and then also from the issuance related to the Adenza deal. And our cash flows remain very strong. I mentioned we had $1.6 billion in free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis. So we feel really well positioned to do all of those things in the priority order that I listed. Year-to-date, $300 million."

After the speaker presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's second quarter 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; Tal Cohen, President; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release, earnings presentation, and supplemental Adenza information are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material, non-public information and complying with disclosure obligations under SEC Regulation FD. I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations, and as such constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and on periodic reports filed with the SEC. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter business and financial performance, the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives, and how our recently announced acquisition of Adenza advances our vision to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. I'll then turn the call over to Ann to review -- for a review of our financial results. I'd like to begin with an update on the strategic transformation underway at Nasdaq. Since 2017, when we sharpened our focus towards becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system, we've made significant progress on our strategic journey by allocating capital to our biggest growth opportunities and reorienting our businesses to align better with the key megatrends shaping the global economy. Over that period, we have focused on our innovation strategy on maximizing the potential of cloud computing and AI across our products and markets, while strategically divesting more than $700 million in non-core assets. We've also delivered consistent execution in our operating business through dynamic operating environments, demonstrating the power of the diversified platform we've built at Nasdaq. That execution strength is reflected in our second quarter performance, which I'll discuss shortly in greater detail. But first, let's spend a few moments on Adenza. When we announced the acquisition of Adenza on June 12, we took a seminal step in our journey to becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system. Our consistent [growth] (ph) throughout Nasdaq's and Adenza's journeys have been our dedication to our clients. As the financial industry faces a steady stream of new regulations and reforms, that present reputational and financial risk. We are positioned to be a key partner in helping participants manage those risks. Most suitably, we will enable our clients to meet regulatory mandates to reduce financial crime, manage liquidity risk, and provide resilient capital markets infrastructure, all while reporting on their compliance to over 100 regulators and agencies around the world. The addition of Adenza's capabilities to the Nasdaq platform will increase our serviceable addressable market by approximately 40%. We saw further evidence of the power of the Adenza business and its performance during the first half of 2023. The company has maintained strong Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR growth in the high teens as compared to the prior year period, which was underpinned by continued strength in gross and net revenue retention at 98% and 115%, respectively. As we discussed at our initial investor call post-announcement, the fundamental drivers of growth in Adenza's business comes from new client sales, cross-sells, and up-sells to existing clients. Consistent with their strong performance in signing new clients over the last two years, which is provided in more detail in the supplemental information that we provided this morning, both Calypso and AxiomSL continued to demonstrate strong growth across new logo-wins and client up-sells in the first half of 2023, validating our acquisition thesis. Specifically, Calyspo signed seven new clients and completed upsells to 40 existing clients in the first half of the year, while AxiomSL added seven new logos, two of which were cross-sells of Calypso clients and completed upsells to 25 existing clients during the period. The recent performance of Adenza furthers our conviction that we are working towards acquiring a business that delivers world-leading solutions that meet the growing dynamic regulatory needs of our clients. Upon closing of the Adenza acquisition, our focus will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefits. With our strong combined free-cash flows, our capital allocation priorities over the next three years are as follows: first, we will begin to delever to meet the debt-to-EBITDA targets that we disclosed upon deal announcement; second, we plan to continue to increase our dividends to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the coming three to four years; and third, we plan to buy-back stock to offset employee and deal related equity dilution. We do not anticipate making any significant acquisitions that would deter us from executing sizable stock buybacks over the next three years. We expect the transaction to close within approximately five to eight months, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. And we look forward to updating you as we move through the closing and integration process. Now turning to the second quarter results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. We achieved $925 million in net revenues, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period, and an increase of 4% also on an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in FX and in acquisition and divestiture. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $674 million, up 6% from the prior year period on a reported and organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6.5% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million in the second quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues comprise 36% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $438 million in total revenue in the second quarter, a 4% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 4% organically from the prior year period. The rebound in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance and inflows of $25 billion over the past 12 months, including $10 billion in the second quarter, partially offset by lower volumes in the Index related futures products. Revenues within Workflow and Insights grew 5% organically over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for IR and ESG solutions and steady analytics solutions sales to asset managers. Similar to the start of the year, we continue to experience elongated sales cycles in certain products within this business. As clients escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval, we just had a modest impact on the year-over-year growth. Overall, across the business, we continue to see opportunities to drive wallet share expansion through cross-sell campaigns to existing clients, especially the uncertainty in the capital markets often leads to increased demand for analytics solutions from asset owners and asset managers, as well as corporate services across investor relations and governance. Our Data & Listing Services revenues grew 2% organically. We experienced 5% growth in our data revenues, primarily driven by growth in our recurring data revenues across our international footprint. With a weaker IPO environment, we saw stable listings revenues year-over-year. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings and year-to-date, Nasdaq has welcomed 48 new operating company IPOs for a 77% win rate, including two of the top three operating company IPOs by proceeds raised. In addition, we have a strong pipeline of companies that are committed to Nasdaq. We remain well-positioned to capture future new listing activity and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO timelines. Turning abroad, we welcomed six new listings across our European markets, bringing our year-to-date total to 13 new listings. Nasdaq Stockholm continues to be one of the leading European exchanges for small-to-medium enterprise listings, welcoming nine new listings in 2023 year-to-date. Next, in our Market Platforms division, we delivered $397 million in total revenues during the second quarter, a 2% organic increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by an increase in the Marketplace Technology revenues, which grew 5% compared to the prior year period. In our Trading Services business, revenues were flat organically compared to the prior year with higher US cash equities revenue offset by lower European equities revenue. I would like to highlight the performance of Nasdaq's Closing Cross during the annual Russell US indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. For Nasdaq listed securities, the Closing Cross successfully executed approximately 2.6 billion shares representing $62 billion in market value in just over 8/10 of one second. This represented the second highest volume of shares crossed since we implemented the Closing Cross in 2004. I'm incredibly proud of our continued leadership in operating the industry\u2019s most robust and resilient market infrastructure. Turning now to two strategic portfolio and capital allocation decisions within our Market Platforms business. First, as we previously announced, during the period we entered into an agreement to sell our European power trading and clearing business to the European Energy Exchange. This decision aligns with our renewed focus towards investing in opportunities that will deliver the most value to our clients and shareholders, and build on our strong position as a leading market operator of European equities, equity derivatives, and fixed income, while also expanding our leadership in providing sustainability solutions with Puro.earth, our voluntary carbon removal Marketplace. We expect the closing to take place in the first -- within the first half of 2024, upon completing all outstanding closing conditions. The transfer of membership interest will occur shortly thereafter. Turning next to our digital assets business. This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the US, we've made the decision to halt our launch of the US digital asset custodian business, and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license. However, we continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital asset software solutions provider to the broader global industry. This includes advancing our custody solution as a technology platform to serve the broader global digital assets Marketplace. More broadly, we remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital assets ecosystem in a variety of ways. Among them, through our ongoing engagement with regulators, the delivery of comprehensive technology solutions across the trade lifecycle and through our partnerships with potential ETF issuers to support tradable exchange listed products. And we'll discuss the modest financial impact of our decision for the remainder of 2023. Turning to the Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 5% reflecting growth in both trade management services and market technology. During the quarter Chile\u2019s central securities depository, DCV, announced a significant expansion in its partnership with Nasdaq with plans to leverage our technology to issue and settle digitized securities. The expansion of our existing partnership with DCV highlights the increasing global desire for market infrastructure that can leverage existing security systems to service emerging asset classes. Additionally, we signed a partnership with Brazil's B3 Exchange to deliver a new clearing platform. The multi-year agreement will focus on leveraging our technology to evolve our existing clearing settlement and risk management capabilities to support the rapid growth of the Brazilian market. We also completed deliveries for seven major market infrastructure projects during the period, including powering the launch of the Stock Exchange of Thailand's new trading system, which included additional market data distribution and market surveillance systems. This implementation of our next-gen trading technology solution marks a significant milestone in the ongoing development of one of Asia's fastest-growing exchanges and illustrates our ability to bring our modern market infrastructure technology to new partners in the region. Finally, turning to our Anti Financial Crime division, we delivered $89 million in total revenue for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year period, all of which was organic. We continue to expand client relationships signing 51 new financial institutions to our fraud and anti-money laundering or what we call FRAML solutions, including 47 small-to-medium sized banks. As we previously-announced, we signed four large financial institutions in the second quarter, including two Tier 1 and two Tier 2 clients. The growing adoption of our FRAML solutions across the banking sector is a strong indication that banks of all sizes are prioritizing risk management spend and looking to Nasdaq to provide mission-critical anti financial crime solutions. Our Surveillance solutions also continued to perform well with 13% revenue growth this quarter, which was all organic, led by increased subscriptions from both new and existing clients. We added 10 new clients in the second-quarter, reflecting strong demand for our trade surveillance and our crypto market surveillance solutions. We've several large clients signed long-term renewals in the first-half of the year, that include their pricing adjustments to reflect the increasing value that our Surveillance solutions provides to our clients. To wrap-up, our second-quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq\u2019s client-centric culture and diversified business model provides the stability to perform well in different market environments. I would also like to reiterate our excitement around the acquisition of Adenza and the impact we believe we will have for our clients and shareholders. It will accelerate our strategic journey, enabling us to deliver even more mission critical platforms that enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global financial system. Adenza combined with our powerful existing solutions sets us up for faster growth and even greater success in the years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. Before getting to our second quarter results, I would like to comment on strategic activities across the company. Starting with the divestiture of our power trading business in Europe, we do not expect the recently announced sale of the business to have a material impact on our financials, and we plan to include historical results for this business in the Corporate and Other portion of our financials starting next quarter. Once all open interest is transferred, we expect the sale to reduce annual revenues and expenses by approximately $35 million and -- $35 million and $20 million, respectively. Turning now to Adenza. We have seen Adenza continue its strong execution across both new customer wins and cross-selling activity. These new customer wins and expansions contributed to Adenza, achieving year-over-year ARR growth in the high teens with both Calypso and Axiom each delivering solid double-digit ARR growth over the past year. We have provided a supplemental information deck that includes information about Adenza's business and recent performance to help further illustrate Adenza's continued strong momentum. As we embark on our integration planning with the Adenza team, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $80 million in net cost synergies by the end of year to post-closing. In order to provide our shareholders transparency into our progress in achieving our Adenza related expense synergies, we will disclose the one-time costs related to achieving our synergies separately from our existing restructuring program that we announced at the start of 2023 related to our divisional realignment. To finance the Adenza acquisition, we have secured financing for the transaction through a successful bond issuance in June, issuing $4.25 billion in US dollar denominated debt across two, five, 10, 30, and 40 year terms, as well as EUR750 million euro denominated eight year bonds. To enable us to manage our deleveraging plan we expect to fund the remainder of the cash component of the transaction with a $600 million term loan that we plan to issue just prior to closing, as well as commercial paper. The estimated weighted average cost of debt is just under 5.5%. To minimize the carrying cost of the debt prior to closing, we are investing the proceeds of the bond issuances in highly liquid and low-risk investments, and we expect the net carry to be less than 50 basis points at current market rates, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP result. With regards to our capital allocation priorities moving forward, as we work to integrate Adenza and optimize our business to achieve the full benefits of the acquisition after the closing, we will be focused on using our free-cash flow to generate return for our shareholders. Specifically, looking back to 2022, Nasdaq generated approximately $1.45 billion in operating free-cash. In 2022 Nasdaq returned approximately $380 million in dividends, which was 26% of free cash flow and we expended approximately $230 million to offset employee-related dilution. That left us with over $800 million in free-cash flow to use for other strategic and investor return activities. With the addition of the shares that will be issued to acquire Adenza, if all else stays the same, our dividend payment at the current payout of $0.22 per share will increase to approximately $510 million annually. We have also stated our plans to increase the dividend to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the next three or four years, which implies an approximately 10% CAGR in the dividend payout ratio over the period. We expect Adenza to generate approximately $300 million in unlevered pre-tax cash flow in 2023. We expect the debt financing for our planned acquisition of Adenza to result in annual interest payment of approximately $325 million, which is more than Adenza\u2019s current free-cash flow. However, as Adenza grows and as we pay-down debt, we expect incremental free-cash flow from the addition of Adenza to fund incremental debt repayment and share buybacks. Based on the 2022 results combined with the full year 2023 estimates for Adenza, we will have approximately $700 million in excess annual free-cash flow beyond our dividends and employee related buybacks and we expect that amount to grow commensurately with our earnings growth over the next three years. With the remainder of the free-cash flows over the next three years, our priority is to delever and bring our leverage ratio to 4.0 times within 18 months and 3.3 times within three years. The [G&A] (ph) ratios reflects the combination of business growth that drive increases in EBITDA, as well as debt pay-downs. Therefore, we will not provide a specific pay-down schedule. However, based on our debt maturity profile and the nature of our debt, we will have the flexibility to pay-down approximately $2 million between now and year-end 2026 without any prepayment penalties or other restrictions. While we don't anticipate needing that full amount to support our path to 3.3 times, we want to have the flexibility to accelerate and/or exceed our pay-down expectations if we believe is the best use of capital to drive shareholder returns. We will also execute share buybacks to help offset the acquisition-related share issuance and support EPS accretion. After the debt pay-down, we will focus on using the vast majority of our remaining free-cash flows to execute share buybacks. Our focus over the coming years will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefit we received from the Adenza acquisition. Therefore as Adena mentioned earlier, we do not anticipate making any significant acquisition-related capital allocation decisions that would deter us from sizable stock buybacks over the coming years. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of US GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter 2023 performance, beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 4% increase in reported net revenue of $925 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 6% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and stable Trading Services revenue and $4 million of net negative impact from changes in FX rates and an acquisition and divestiture. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 140 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $350 million or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $342 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million, an increase of 11%. We are delivering solid performance despite low IPO volumes and elongated sales cycles in certain areas of the Capital Access Platforms division, which had a modest impact on the rate of ARR and SaaS growth this quarter. We are well positioned to deliver improving revenue growth as sales cycles normalize and capital market activity increases. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15. Starting with the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $5 million or 1%, with an organic increase of 2%. Trading Services organic revenue was flat, with higher US revenues driven by strong US equity capture and continued options volumes, offset by lower trading revenues -- European trading revenue due to lower volumes despite better share. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 5% revenue growth driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology. As a reminder, Trade Management Services revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue that we do not expect to recur in the second half of the year. Additionally, we will face tougher comps in the back half of the year as we cycle through strong revenue growth we had in 3Q and 4Q last year. And therefore, we continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium-term outlook. ARR totaled $516 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 53% in the second quarter of 2023 reflects a 200 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue resulting from lower European trading activity, with ongoing investments related to migrating US markets to the cloud and investments in new growth opportunities in marketplace technology. Capital Access Platforms revenues increased $16 million or 4%, with organic revenue growth of $15 million, excluding $1 million related to an acquisition. Growth in the division was broad-based for the quarter. Specifically, Index revenue returned to growth, delivering a 4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 9% increase in average AUM over the last year. Licensing revenues for future contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 9%, reflecting a 28% decline in trading volumes, which was partially offset by higher pricing per contract. Second quarter revenues also benefited from improving futures revenue share related to meeting certain contractual milestones in the quarter. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $25 billion, including $10 million in the quarter. In Data, revenue grew by 5% due to continued strong demand from enterprise and international customer strategies, with growth in recurring data sales driving solid revenue growth. Listings revenue was flat year-over-year due to continued weak IPO environment, coupled with slightly elevated delistings, including SPAC. Workflow & Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting growth across our ESG, IR and Analytics businesses despite ongoing elongated sales cycles among corporates and asset owners affecting revenue growth in the second quarter. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period, which reflected a significant slowdown in new listings and the impact of continuing elongated sales cycles. The division operating margin was 55% in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 200 basis points from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 19% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 19% in the period. The growth reflects robust demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Specifically, our Fraud Detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2022, with solid growth in subscription revenues from new and existing customers, partially offset by softer professional fees. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $339 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced totaled $365 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 36% in the second quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period, with approximately one half of the margin growth resulting from a benefit in our expenses due to a onetime adjustment to the incentive compensation program. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $441 million. The increase primarily reflects a $34 million organic increase or 8%, partially offset by a $6 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense reflecting higher headcount and technology spend as we continue making growth investments across the platform. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, expenses increased due to the timing of our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. However, this sequential increase was less than we expected due to the previously mentioned onetime adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program, as well as lower-than-expected hiring and client incentive marketing spend. We are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by $30 million to a range of $1.785 billion to $1.815 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range now represents an annual expense increase of just below 5% for 2023. The decrease in our expense growth expectations primarily reflects the impact of our decision related to the redesign of our digital assets offering as well as the adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, due to the timing of expected expenses, we expect a greater sequential increase in expenses in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrop. During the second quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $109 million. As of June 30, 2023 there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. In closing, today, Nasdaq's second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to perform consistently well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. So for the two new Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients signed in Anti-Fin Crime in the second quarter, could you please give us an update on the timing of the implementation and the timing you can book the revenue? And also -- could you please also give us more color on the traction and pipeline in this business? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Owen. So with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients, some of them -- we signed two of them kind of early in the quarter and signed two more of them a little bit later in the quarter. I think that each of them is going to have a slightly different time line. These are more complex implementations. But we would expect kind of a six to nine month implementation period for them. So -- and we will start to therefore be able to kind of demonstrate the revenue benefit of them as we bring them online. So hopefully, that means that we'll be able to bring at least most of them into online before the end of the year or early next year is, I think, the plan right now. In terms of the pipeline, we actually are very encouraged by the continued pipeline of larger banks that are working with us, either in contracting or on POCs. We have several that are working with us in their proof of concepts, and we have another several that are working with us in contracting. But of course, as we've talked about from the very beginning, the contracting process with banks takes a long time, particularly as you get up market. And so this will continue to be, what I would call, a slow-moving train as we continue to bring more of the larger banks online to our Anti-Fin Crime solutions.\nOwen Lau: Got it. That's helpful. And also, I recognize that the Index AUM has recovered a lot, but the revenue actually came in much stronger than our expectation. And I think you've mentioned like pricing on certain contractual milestones. But is there anything you want to highlight on this business? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Owen. We did update our disclosures since the beginning of the year to help you understand the average AUM for the quarter -- for each quarter. I think with regard to -- so you have to kind of look at it both on the AUM side, and we do provide a fair amount of disclosures to help you estimate that. I think then on the trading side, it's -- as we said, it's a combination of things. It's obviously combination of the pricing that CME chooses, they are combination of the volumes and then how the contract works. And as of prior quarters, we did hit a new contractual tier in the second quarter, which I think has been consistent with prior years. I don't think there's really other things to really mention there other than just we're really excited, frankly, to see the recovery of the Index AUM, the fact that it's obviously reflecting the recovery of the market. And most notably, what we can control, which is the inflows into the indexes at $25 billion over the last year.\nOwen Lau: Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Owen.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Adena, I wanted to go back to Adenza. Your stock has reacted negatively since the acquisition. So just wondering, based on maybe your conversations with investors, what do you think investors are getting about this acquisition? And then what, if anything, if you could has maybe surprised you about the reaction since the announcement? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, thanks, Patrick. So we -- as I've mentioned before, we are very excited about being able to bring Adenza into Nasdaq. And I do think that we're making a long-term conviction decision here to grow and expand our platform to be able to serve the financial institutions more holistically. The fact is that, Adenza is a private company and there was a lot for investors to learn, it's obviously also a big capital allocation decision that we're making. And so, we're trying to make sure that we continue the educational journey with investors, and we provided a supplement today that hopefully gives a little bit more color on the depth of the clientele, the nature of the products and how we look at it together in terms of how we can provide complete risk management reg-tech type solutions for our clients and how all of our solutions will fit together. I just think that it's -- as we've mentioned before, it's an exceptional asset. It's got 15% growth and we're kind of seeing the range of 13% to 16% in general. It has 98% gross revenue retention, 115% net retention. It still is signing on new clients across the spectrum of the clientele around the world, and it upsells clients really successfully. We're also seeing a lot of great tailwinds, frankly, just from the changes in regulation with -- including the Fed announcement last week in terms of new proposed rules for the US banks, that will obviously play into the capabilities. And one of the examples we provided in the supplement is from a super-regional bank in the US that has over $100 billion of assets that has kind of signed on for the Axiom solutions very quickly as they're looking at the new rules that may be coming. But we also have a whole range of new rules, obviously, across the world and that is a very dynamic environment. It's super complex. And I think also as banks also look to expand growth, expand regionally, expand asset classes, they leverage our solutions and we can expand with them. So I have to say we are clearly very excited to help them solve their most challenging operational problems. I think we also want them to be able to kind of, what I call, simplify the complexities that they're dealing with, with technology. And over time, we feel very confident that we will be able to demonstrate both to the clients and to the shareholders that this is a great business to have within Nasdaq.\nPatrick Moley: Great color. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Patrick.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just circling back to the Capital Access Platforms, you mentioned seeing some increased demand internationally for data. I was hoping you might be able to elaborate on what sort of data sets and customers, which countries are you seeing that from? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Michael. We don't provide details on every country, but I would say, we've been very successful in expanding across Asia and Lat Am, and that continues. So it's not just -- I would say, as we started our efforts in Asia several years ago, we found a lot of great demand in China, and then we expanded into Korea and now into Southeast Asia. And so, it's just -- it's a great opportunity for investors from all over the world to gain exposure to U.S. markets and understand the data in real time. And then we also expand -- have done a really nice job of working with our colleagues that manage, for instance, listings and market tech in Latin America to kind of open up the Latin American market for data, and we continue to see really strong demand there. So it really has been kind of a global expansion of the distribution of real-time information. And then we also have our Data Link platform, and that's also growing nicely with some really unique data sets that our clients are adding to their portfolios. And so, that also has been a really nice growth pillar for us in the data business.\nMichael Cyprys: And sorry, which type of data is this?\nAdena Friedman: I mean we've talked about Data Link being kind of a delivery mechanism for our market data, for third-party kind of what we call unique data sets that we think will help clients look at kind of underpinning, like KPIs and other things that might underpin the performance of companies. We also provide information around retail flows within the Data Link platform in partnership with the client, with the partner. I mean, so it's really kind of a full range of information or data sets that are available. Data Link, there is actually a website, if you're interested, and that provides kind of a library of all the different data sets that are available through Data Link. And it's actually -- what's really cool is, they're all offered on and out through a very modern API structure, so it's really easy for our clients to take the data in and integrate them into their internal audit systems.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just if I could ask a follow-up question on Adenza. I was hoping you might be able to talk about the sales strategy, their approach to marketing and sales efforts. Maybe you could elaborate on how large their team is, how that's organized and how you might evolve their approach and resources.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Actually, it's one of the things we really like about how they've organized the business. So when Calypso and Axiom came together, what they did was, they still have two discrete platform -- technology platforms, and I think that they do solve different needs. So it makes sense for those platforms to be discrete. But they first of all, before I talk about marketing, they do -- they're all -- they're starting to demonstrate the power of the business by sharing data through modern APIs that they can cross over from one platform to another to service specific clients, and I think that's going to help with cross-sells going forward. But the way that they organize their go-to-market is that, they have a product team and the product team has kind of a marketing team within it, so product marketing, and then they also have specific product sales on people. And then they have an enterprise sales team. And that enterprise sales team really is regionally focused and really talks to -- kind of goes high up in the organization as possible to talk about the complete solution set to understand their needs, understand their problems, and then they'll bring in the product sales team to help with specific -- kind of [client] (ph) specific products and capabilities that the company has. And then once a client signs a contract, then they start to engage with the client success team, the client implementation team. And the way that they've been able to organize that as they try to match up the client success organization with specific sales -- enterprise sales people so that there's consistency in the experience that the clients have moving into implementation. And then they have, I think, a very good and scaled client success organization. So we like that model because it kind of creates kind of an umbrella go-to-market and client service capabilities across multiple products. And so as we bring Adenza into Nasdaq and we think about how we want to integrate that with our Market Technology business, with the Surveillance business, we think there's opportunities for us to really leverage that scaled model for the broader technology platform. And that then allows us to go in kind of towards the top of the house within the banks, explain our complete solution suite and then deploy our product teams appropriately into meeting their needs. So we're very excited about that.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just starting with a follow-up on Verafin and this maybe nitpicky, because we're just getting used to some of these new disclosures. But when I look at signed ARR on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which should imply net new sales, I think that was $11 million, which, if my numbers are right, is flat year-over-year. So when I think about those four bigger size wins, does that mean that -- what does it imply for the rest of the business? Does it mean slower sales to Tier 3 and beyond? Slower pricing power? Or again, these are small numbers, but just wondering if the remainder of the business is chugging along quite well as well.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. No, Alex, I'm not going to be able to kind of go into all these discrete details, but I would say this, the business is chugging along quite well. I mean, we had 47 new small to medium bank clients sign on in the quarter, and then we had the four. And so kind of the composition of ARR, we'll have to kind of unpack what you're asking and make sure that we can give you a more discrete answer. But generally speaking, it's generally healthy. I mean, we have good signings of the small to medium banks. We have good signings of the larger banks, and those will come online as we get later in the year. And you're right that, it's signed ARR, so they should be reflected there. And then, of course, in the Surveillance business also, we have -- as mentioned, we had 10 new clients. So I think we'll have to kind of work to make sure that we reflect that in a way that helps you. But I think that we said basically 20% growth in signed ARR year-over-year, so we'll have to understand more of your discrete question later.\nAlex Kramm: Fair enough. And then secondly, this is maybe a little bit more strategic. But clearly, you announced another divestiture during the quarter and that's been part of kind of like the strategic pivot as well. Now that you've done Adenza here, reasonably sizable deal, big leverage, the question has been coming up a little bit more, it's like, hey, could there be other bigger divestitures that actually help accelerate the pivot even further? And not surprisingly, OMX comes up a lot here. So, I know you're not going to talk specifically about that asset, I guess, in terms of any potential to sell it. But maybe you can just remind us why OMX and other related business is a core component of the Nasdaq strategy, how it fits in there? Because clearly, people are asking the question. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I know you're in Europe for this week, so I have a feeling you're hearing that there. But I -- first of all, we don't use the name OMX anymore, because they are -- they've been part of the Nasdaq family for 15 years. So -- but our European trading -- our European markets business is an integral and strategic part of who we are. And I think that I can say that with great conviction. And the reason is that, number one, the European business, I mean, the Nordic business and the Nordic markets are, in my opinion, the shining star of Europe. They've got great retail participation. They've got great markets. They've got a great financial ecosystem that underpin the markets there. I think we've been able to show over the last five years a very healthy listing environment. We also have great data sales of the Nordic data. And then we also had a trading business, because that business is comprised of all three of those components. We also have deep relationships across the Nordic banks and brokerage firms. We see that team that's in Europe sits right next to our Market Technology team. And so, the expertise that they have in running their own market, they are often deployed with our Market Tech team to go help and develop other markets around the world. We'll bring them out into markets all over the world and help them, let's say, develop their surveillance programs, help them understand market structure, think about auctions and things like that. So that team is integral to the Market Tech team and helping us sell and expand our technology around the world. And then also culturally, they've been obviously a leader in ESG. They've brought that ESG culture into Nasdaq. They helped us think about designing products that we now provide to our corporates to help them manage the complexities there. And then we have Puro.earth, which is our carbon removal marketplace that helps corporates meet their net zero commitment. So it is an integral part of who we are. And then the last thing I would say is, we've been on a very specific path to integrate -- to make our technologies more consistent between the US markets and the European markets. We launched our, what we call our Fusion platform, which I love that name because it is, in fact, fusing our technologies across our markets. And we've deployed that in the Nordic through this market. We're now deploying that across our US options markets. All of our surrounding systems have become consistent. And so, we're going to be able to demonstrate over time even more scalability across our markets business as we continue to combine that technology. So as you can tell, it's a big part of who we are. We're really proud and pleased to be integrated into the Nordic business as our Nordic markets as we are. So hopefully, that helps you.\nAlex Kramm: Very clear, and I'll try to forget the OMX name. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Alex.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. So you noted AxiomSL added seven logos and two of those were cross-sells to Calypso clients, which really suggests they're having success in kind of driving revenue synergies from that combination. Just given those businesses haven't been integrated for that long, I think since maybe July 2021, I'm wondering how far along Adenza is in terms of driving those AxiomSL and Calypso revenue synergies and cross-sells. And I guess, is it fair to think that a majority of those revenue synergy opportunities really haven't been realized at this point?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I actually would agree with that completely. So as we've talked about, when you're selling into some of these larger banks, the process of getting sales done tends to be longer. So you're right, if they kind of came together in 2021, they then had integrations. They had their own operational integrations they were implementing. They want to educate their sales organization. They have their whole enterprise sales model, I mentioned it before. And so, they are just now really starting to demonstrate how the cross-sells can work. I think they've had five cross-sells and now they've been able to add two more. So, they are starting to show that there is real potential here to cross-sell capabilities. And hopefully, that also means the potential to shorten sales cycles. Because if you have a master services agreement and then you cross-sell another product, the hope is that you can cut down on the contracting time. But it is just beginning in terms of showing how they can open up doors. And the other thing to mention is on Page 3 of the supplement, we show you the revenue composition by bank tier or by client tier, and you can kind of see that they're different, right, from between Calypso and Axiom, but they're selling into all of those tiers, both of them. But they have certain strengths in different tiers. And so, as we think about the power of bringing those two platforms together and then the power of bringing our ASC capabilities and our Market Tech with it, you can kind of think about how we can help each other grow and expand in those tiers where they may be less penetrated. So that's obviously part of our investment thesis as well.\nKyle Voigt: That's great. And then just maybe one follow-up on Adenza, if I could. In the deck, you reiterated that TAM growing 6%, the SAM is growing 8%. And I understand there's a lot of opportunity with the chop on driving higher revenue growth near term and that kind of teens growth range, especially with the regulatory changes that you cited earlier. But I was wondering if you could kind of rearticulate on a longer-term basis why this Adenza business might be able to sustainably grow faster than a 6% TAM or an 8% SAM. Whether that's gaining share competitively or how it's positioned within its subsegments within that SAM that would be really helpful.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. They are gaining share. So that's really exciting to see. And they are, in fact, winning -- they're winning mandates from companies that have competitors. So, that is kind of how -- obviously, how they're winning share. So I think that, that's a very -- that's an exciting part of why we really like their business. They have -- unlike some of their competitors, they're very modular. So they can go in and with one module to kind of breakthrough to a client and then demonstrate their value and then start to expand across other modules, which then allows them to say, you know what, we can do that for you instead of this competitor. We can do this for you instead of that competitor. And they start to penetrate the client by gaining share as well as reducing their internal spend. And frankly, that's a strategy that we're seeing really successfully play out within Verafin as well. So we do know that strategy can be very effective. Within Verafin, just to digress for one second, we penetrated one of the clients that we went into on the Tier 2s, we went in just showing them our alerting capabilities. And they then said, \"Well, wait, your workflow is so much better than what we have. Let me actually -- we're going to use not only your learning, but we're going to use your workflows as well.\" And now they want to -- and that was on AML and now they want to kind of look over on the fraud side. And they have existing systems in fraud, but they realized just how, frankly, awesome our platform is. So it allows us to go in and land and then expand by potentially taking out competitors. And I think -- I also think that Calypso and Axiom, the teams, they don't stand still. They're adding new capabilities that will, obviously, continue to grow the market opportunity. And an example of that is that Calypso, in the last few years have moved into the buy side. And not just opening up a whole new segment, client segment, they went from like three to -- I don't want to say the wrong thing, but like 3% to 14% of their revenue coming from the buy side just in the last few years, so that's a growth area. And then lastly, as they're deploying their solutions in cloud, so 53% of their sales this year so far have been cloud-deployed modules. That actually allows them to be a managed service provider, which then, of course, allows them to take a bigger share of wallet as they're managing the product and not just deploying it. So those are all the reasons why we think the revenue growth is highly sustainable.\nKyle Voigt: Very clear. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll just follow-up with another Adenza question as well. When we kind of think about the large recurring revenues of Adenza, I realize the new clients and upsells are driving the majority of the revenue growth here. But if we think about existing clients and kind of existing contracts, is there a volume component to any of those contracted revenues? I mean just trying to better understand the recurring nature of the revenue profile and revenue growth for Adenza. I think this may speak to more towards [indiscernible], but maybe you can elaborate there.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. We have not seen any sort of volume-driven contracts like that. So it's really a -- just think of it as a licensed service maintenance and/or cloud delivered subscription. So they don't have volume kickers within their contracts as far as we know. I think it is much more of a traditional software business. Hopefully, that answers your question, your specific question.\nMichael Cho: Yes. No, great. And then just a follow-up, just to switch gears on digital assets. I realize you mentioned about the custodian initiative being halted. Is this a clean pivot away permanently or more of a delay? And I realize Nasdaq is still going to be highly involved in the digital assets ecosystem in a meaningful way. But hoping you can kind of flesh out some of the considerations here as you thought about the custodian initiative. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I try to avoid the word forever. But I would say that what we've chosen to do is really halt our efforts in deploying a custody solution and as a custodian, I should say, like being a custodian in the US crypto marketplace. And the regulatory environment is fast changing, right? It's at least trying to evolve into something that's understandable. Let's see how it does over the next several months and so I think -- and maybe years. But we like to operate in environments that have a pretty well-known regulatory underpinning. That's just where we're comfortable. It's consistent with our risk tolerance. It's consistent with how we know we can be successful. And the regulatory nature of the business has evolved a lot. And the lack of clarity, I think, has made it to that. As we looked at the opportunity set of just being a custodian, nothing else like just that one segment of the business. Just the fundamental business opportunity changed over the last several months and then the regulatory overlay and kind of overhang changed as well. And I think that just made us decide that it's not the right time for us to enter that business. Will we ever enter that business? It's possible, but we'd likely do it in connection with other things we might want to try to do in the digital asset space. But right now, our focus is really on being a great technology provider, helping our clients with their potential for ETF listings, Bitcoin ETF listings, and continuing to provide Index solutions in the crypto currency space.\nMichael Cho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I can keep these quick, I think. One on Verafin, the growth -- the year-over-year growth rate has been in the 20% plus area. It's come down into the high teens, but now it's moved back up in the second quarter up to 19% year-over-year. So I'm wondering are the new sales coming in? I know there's a six to nine month time line in the Tier 1 and 2s. But with organic growth of the Tier 3s and below, do you see this business moving back into a sustainable 20% plus area of annual revenue growth over the next couple of quarters?\nAdena Friedman: Well, I won't give a projection. But I would say that, obviously, as the business is going well. But recognize that AFC is a combination of Surveillance and Verafin, and Surveillance had a little bit of a slower start of the year. And so obviously, I think it's shown that really great strength in the second quarter. And so there are going to be ebbs and flows, and that's why we give you more of a range. Let me give you an absolute number. We give that 18% to 23% range because there are going to be periods of time where we may be able to speed up as we sign more of the larger deals and then we may have more of a lull within a quarter or two. So I would have to say, I think that we feel good about the range we provided you. We're very excited about the strength of showing both -- all the new sales, both within Surveillance and Verafin in this quarter. But I think, Brian, it's going to ebb and flow just a little bit. It is a SaaS business, so it's not going to ebb and flow too much, but that's why we give you the range.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. That's super helpful. And then the follow-up just for Ann. I think I heard you say on the Power business that it wasn't going to be material overall, and I heard the $35 million and $20 million. Can you just restate that again in terms of the revenue impact and then the expense impact?\nAnn Dennison: Yes, sure. So if we're just looking back to 2022 and you look at it on an annual basis, we'd expect once we've closed on the sale that we see a reduction in revenues of around $35 million and approximately $20 million reduction in expenses. And what we do plan to do starting next quarter is reclass that out of the Market Platforms business into our Corporate and Other segments, you'll be able to see that decline as the sales closes.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you, and thanks very much for your time today. We are excited to continue to update you on all of our progress in our business, while we also prepare for our next chapter with Adenza as part of the Nasdaq organization. So thanks for all your questions, and I hope you all have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. My remarks today will focus on Nasdaq's second quarter business and financial performance, the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives, and how our recently announced acquisition of Adenza advances our vision to become the trusted fabric of the world's financial system. I'll then turn the call over to Ann to review -- for a review of our financial results. I'd like to begin with an update on the strategic transformation underway at Nasdaq. Since 2017, when we sharpened our focus towards becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system, we've made significant progress on our strategic journey by allocating capital to our biggest growth opportunities and reorienting our businesses to align better with the key megatrends shaping the global economy. Over that period, we have focused on our innovation strategy on maximizing the potential of cloud computing and AI across our products and markets, while strategically divesting more than $700 million in non-core assets. We've also delivered consistent execution in our operating business through dynamic operating environments, demonstrating the power of the diversified platform we've built at Nasdaq. That execution strength is reflected in our second quarter performance, which I'll discuss shortly in greater detail. But first, let's spend a few moments on Adenza. When we announced the acquisition of Adenza on June 12, we took a seminal step in our journey to becoming a leading technology provider to the global financial system. Our consistent [growth] (ph) throughout Nasdaq's and Adenza's journeys have been our dedication to our clients. As the financial industry faces a steady stream of new regulations and reforms, that present reputational and financial risk. We are positioned to be a key partner in helping participants manage those risks. Most suitably, we will enable our clients to meet regulatory mandates to reduce financial crime, manage liquidity risk, and provide resilient capital markets infrastructure, all while reporting on their compliance to over 100 regulators and agencies around the world. The addition of Adenza's capabilities to the Nasdaq platform will increase our serviceable addressable market by approximately 40%. We saw further evidence of the power of the Adenza business and its performance during the first half of 2023. The company has maintained strong Annualized Recurring Revenue or ARR growth in the high teens as compared to the prior year period, which was underpinned by continued strength in gross and net revenue retention at 98% and 115%, respectively. As we discussed at our initial investor call post-announcement, the fundamental drivers of growth in Adenza's business comes from new client sales, cross-sells, and up-sells to existing clients. Consistent with their strong performance in signing new clients over the last two years, which is provided in more detail in the supplemental information that we provided this morning, both Calypso and AxiomSL continued to demonstrate strong growth across new logo-wins and client up-sells in the first half of 2023, validating our acquisition thesis. Specifically, Calyspo signed seven new clients and completed upsells to 40 existing clients in the first half of the year, while AxiomSL added seven new logos, two of which were cross-sells of Calypso clients and completed upsells to 25 existing clients during the period. The recent performance of Adenza furthers our conviction that we are working towards acquiring a business that delivers world-leading solutions that meet the growing dynamic regulatory needs of our clients. Upon closing of the Adenza acquisition, our focus will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefits. With our strong combined free-cash flows, our capital allocation priorities over the next three years are as follows: first, we will begin to delever to meet the debt-to-EBITDA targets that we disclosed upon deal announcement; second, we plan to continue to increase our dividends to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the coming three to four years; and third, we plan to buy-back stock to offset employee and deal related equity dilution. We do not anticipate making any significant acquisitions that would deter us from executing sizable stock buybacks over the next three years. We expect the transaction to close within approximately five to eight months, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions. And we look forward to updating you as we move through the closing and integration process. Now turning to the second quarter results. I'm pleased to report Nasdaq's continued solid financial performance in the second quarter of 2023. We achieved $925 million in net revenues, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period, and an increase of 4% also on an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in FX and in acquisition and divestiture. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $674 million, up 6% from the prior year period on a reported and organic basis. Our total ARR increased 6.5% to $2.1 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million in the second quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues comprise 36% of total company ARR. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $438 million in total revenue in the second quarter, a 4% increase from the prior year period. Our Index revenues grew 4% organically from the prior year period. The rebound in our Index business reflects strong year-over-year market performance and inflows of $25 billion over the past 12 months, including $10 billion in the second quarter, partially offset by lower volumes in the Index related futures products. Revenues within Workflow and Insights grew 5% organically over the prior year period, reflecting sustained demand for IR and ESG solutions and steady analytics solutions sales to asset managers. Similar to the start of the year, we continue to experience elongated sales cycles in certain products within this business. As clients escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval, we just had a modest impact on the year-over-year growth. Overall, across the business, we continue to see opportunities to drive wallet share expansion through cross-sell campaigns to existing clients, especially the uncertainty in the capital markets often leads to increased demand for analytics solutions from asset owners and asset managers, as well as corporate services across investor relations and governance. Our Data & Listing Services revenues grew 2% organically. We experienced 5% growth in our data revenues, primarily driven by growth in our recurring data revenues across our international footprint. With a weaker IPO environment, we saw stable listings revenues year-over-year. We maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings and year-to-date, Nasdaq has welcomed 48 new operating company IPOs for a 77% win rate, including two of the top three operating company IPOs by proceeds raised. In addition, we have a strong pipeline of companies that are committed to Nasdaq. We remain well-positioned to capture future new listing activity and are in close contact with these companies as they evaluate their IPO timelines. Turning abroad, we welcomed six new listings across our European markets, bringing our year-to-date total to 13 new listings. Nasdaq Stockholm continues to be one of the leading European exchanges for small-to-medium enterprise listings, welcoming nine new listings in 2023 year-to-date. Next, in our Market Platforms division, we delivered $397 million in total revenues during the second quarter, a 2% organic increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by an increase in the Marketplace Technology revenues, which grew 5% compared to the prior year period. In our Trading Services business, revenues were flat organically compared to the prior year with higher US cash equities revenue offset by lower European equities revenue. I would like to highlight the performance of Nasdaq's Closing Cross during the annual Russell US indexes reconstitution, which occurred in late June. For Nasdaq listed securities, the Closing Cross successfully executed approximately 2.6 billion shares representing $62 billion in market value in just over 8/10 of one second. This represented the second highest volume of shares crossed since we implemented the Closing Cross in 2004. I'm incredibly proud of our continued leadership in operating the industry's most robust and resilient market infrastructure. Turning now to two strategic portfolio and capital allocation decisions within our Market Platforms business. First, as we previously announced, during the period we entered into an agreement to sell our European power trading and clearing business to the European Energy Exchange. This decision aligns with our renewed focus towards investing in opportunities that will deliver the most value to our clients and shareholders, and build on our strong position as a leading market operator of European equities, equity derivatives, and fixed income, while also expanding our leadership in providing sustainability solutions with Puro.earth, our voluntary carbon removal Marketplace. We expect the closing to take place in the first -- within the first half of 2024, upon completing all outstanding closing conditions. The transfer of membership interest will occur shortly thereafter. Turning next to our digital assets business. This quarter, considering the shifting business and regulatory environment in the US, we've made the decision to halt our launch of the US digital asset custodian business, and our related efforts to pursue a relevant license. However, we continue to build and deliver technology capabilities that position Nasdaq as a leading digital asset software solutions provider to the broader global industry. This includes advancing our custody solution as a technology platform to serve the broader global digital assets Marketplace. More broadly, we remain committed to supporting the evolution of the digital assets ecosystem in a variety of ways. Among them, through our ongoing engagement with regulators, the delivery of comprehensive technology solutions across the trade lifecycle and through our partnerships with potential ETF issuers to support tradable exchange listed products. And we'll discuss the modest financial impact of our decision for the remainder of 2023. Turning to the Marketplace Technology business, revenue grew 5% reflecting growth in both trade management services and market technology. During the quarter Chile's central securities depository, DCV, announced a significant expansion in its partnership with Nasdaq with plans to leverage our technology to issue and settle digitized securities. The expansion of our existing partnership with DCV highlights the increasing global desire for market infrastructure that can leverage existing security systems to service emerging asset classes. Additionally, we signed a partnership with Brazil's B3 Exchange to deliver a new clearing platform. The multi-year agreement will focus on leveraging our technology to evolve our existing clearing settlement and risk management capabilities to support the rapid growth of the Brazilian market. We also completed deliveries for seven major market infrastructure projects during the period, including powering the launch of the Stock Exchange of Thailand's new trading system, which included additional market data distribution and market surveillance systems. This implementation of our next-gen trading technology solution marks a significant milestone in the ongoing development of one of Asia's fastest-growing exchanges and illustrates our ability to bring our modern market infrastructure technology to new partners in the region. Finally, turning to our Anti Financial Crime division, we delivered $89 million in total revenue for the second quarter, a 19% increase from the prior year period, all of which was organic. We continue to expand client relationships signing 51 new financial institutions to our fraud and anti-money laundering or what we call FRAML solutions, including 47 small-to-medium sized banks. As we previously-announced, we signed four large financial institutions in the second quarter, including two Tier 1 and two Tier 2 clients. The growing adoption of our FRAML solutions across the banking sector is a strong indication that banks of all sizes are prioritizing risk management spend and looking to Nasdaq to provide mission-critical anti financial crime solutions. Our Surveillance solutions also continued to perform well with 13% revenue growth this quarter, which was all organic, led by increased subscriptions from both new and existing clients. We added 10 new clients in the second-quarter, reflecting strong demand for our trade surveillance and our crypto market surveillance solutions. We've several large clients signed long-term renewals in the first-half of the year, that include their pricing adjustments to reflect the increasing value that our Surveillance solutions provides to our clients. To wrap-up, our second-quarter results demonstrate how Nasdaq's client-centric culture and diversified business model provides the stability to perform well in different market environments. I would also like to reiterate our excitement around the acquisition of Adenza and the impact we believe we will have for our clients and shareholders. It will accelerate our strategic journey, enabling us to deliver even more mission critical platforms that enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global financial system. Adenza combined with our powerful existing solutions sets us up for faster growth and even greater success in the years to come. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Ann to review our financial details. Sure. Thanks, Owen. So with the Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients, some of them -- we signed two of them kind of early in the quarter and signed two more of them a little bit later in the quarter. I think that each of them is going to have a slightly different time line. These are more complex implementations. But we would expect kind of a six to nine month implementation period for them. So -- and we will start to therefore be able to kind of demonstrate the revenue benefit of them as we bring them online. So hopefully, that means that we'll be able to bring at least most of them into online before the end of the year or early next year is, I think, the plan right now. In terms of the pipeline, we actually are very encouraged by the continued pipeline of larger banks that are working with us, either in contracting or on POCs. We have several that are working with us in their proof of concepts, and we have another several that are working with us in contracting. But of course, as we've talked about from the very beginning, the contracting process with banks takes a long time, particularly as you get up market. And so this will continue to be, what I would call, a slow-moving train as we continue to bring more of the larger banks online to our Anti-Fin Crime solutions. Sure. Thanks, Owen. We did update our disclosures since the beginning of the year to help you understand the average AUM for the quarter -- for each quarter. I think with regard to -- so you have to kind of look at it both on the AUM side, and we do provide a fair amount of disclosures to help you estimate that. I think then on the trading side, it's -- as we said, it's a combination of things. It's obviously combination of the pricing that CME chooses, they are combination of the volumes and then how the contract works. And as of prior quarters, we did hit a new contractual tier in the second quarter, which I think has been consistent with prior years. I don't think there's really other things to really mention there other than just we're really excited, frankly, to see the recovery of the Index AUM, the fact that it's obviously reflecting the recovery of the market. And most notably, what we can control, which is the inflows into the indexes at $25 billion over the last year. Thanks, Owen. Sure. Well, thanks, Patrick. So we -- as I've mentioned before, we are very excited about being able to bring Adenza into Nasdaq. And I do think that we're making a long-term conviction decision here to grow and expand our platform to be able to serve the financial institutions more holistically. The fact is that, Adenza is a private company and there was a lot for investors to learn, it's obviously also a big capital allocation decision that we're making. And so, we're trying to make sure that we continue the educational journey with investors, and we provided a supplement today that hopefully gives a little bit more color on the depth of the clientele, the nature of the products and how we look at it together in terms of how we can provide complete risk management reg-tech type solutions for our clients and how all of our solutions will fit together. I just think that it's -- as we've mentioned before, it's an exceptional asset. It's got 15% growth and we're kind of seeing the range of 13% to 16% in general. It has 98% gross revenue retention, 115% net retention. It still is signing on new clients across the spectrum of the clientele around the world, and it upsells clients really successfully. We're also seeing a lot of great tailwinds, frankly, just from the changes in regulation with -- including the Fed announcement last week in terms of new proposed rules for the US banks, that will obviously play into the capabilities. And one of the examples we provided in the supplement is from a super-regional bank in the US that has over $100 billion of assets that has kind of signed on for the Axiom solutions very quickly as they're looking at the new rules that may be coming. But we also have a whole range of new rules, obviously, across the world and that is a very dynamic environment. It's super complex. And I think also as banks also look to expand growth, expand regionally, expand asset classes, they leverage our solutions and we can expand with them. So I have to say we are clearly very excited to help them solve their most challenging operational problems. I think we also want them to be able to kind of, what I call, simplify the complexities that they're dealing with, with technology. And over time, we feel very confident that we will be able to demonstrate both to the clients and to the shareholders that this is a great business to have within Nasdaq. Thanks, Patrick. Thank you, Michael. We don't provide details on every country, but I would say, we've been very successful in expanding across Asia and Lat Am, and that continues. So it's not just -- I would say, as we started our efforts in Asia several years ago, we found a lot of great demand in China, and then we expanded into Korea and now into Southeast Asia. And so, it's just -- it's a great opportunity for investors from all over the world to gain exposure to U.S. markets and understand the data in real time. And then we also expand -- have done a really nice job of working with our colleagues that manage, for instance, listings and market tech in Latin America to kind of open up the Latin American market for data, and we continue to see really strong demand there. So it really has been kind of a global expansion of the distribution of real-time information. And then we also have our Data Link platform, and that's also growing nicely with some really unique data sets that our clients are adding to their portfolios. And so, that also has been a really nice growth pillar for us in the data business. I mean we've talked about Data Link being kind of a delivery mechanism for our market data, for third-party kind of what we call unique data sets that we think will help clients look at kind of underpinning, like KPIs and other things that might underpin the performance of companies. We also provide information around retail flows within the Data Link platform in partnership with the client, with the partner. I mean, so it's really kind of a full range of information or data sets that are available. Data Link, there is actually a website, if you're interested, and that provides kind of a library of all the different data sets that are available through Data Link. And it's actually -- what's really cool is, they're all offered on and out through a very modern API structure, so it's really easy for our clients to take the data in and integrate them into their internal audit systems. Sure. Yes. Actually, it's one of the things we really like about how they've organized the business. So when Calypso and Axiom came together, what they did was, they still have two discrete platform -- technology platforms, and I think that they do solve different needs. So it makes sense for those platforms to be discrete. But they first of all, before I talk about marketing, they do -- they're all -- they're starting to demonstrate the power of the business by sharing data through modern APIs that they can cross over from one platform to another to service specific clients, and I think that's going to help with cross-sells going forward. But the way that they organize their go-to-market is that, they have a product team and the product team has kind of a marketing team within it, so product marketing, and then they also have specific product sales on people. And then they have an enterprise sales team. And that enterprise sales team really is regionally focused and really talks to -- kind of goes high up in the organization as possible to talk about the complete solution set to understand their needs, understand their problems, and then they'll bring in the product sales team to help with specific -- kind of [client] (ph) specific products and capabilities that the company has. And then once a client signs a contract, then they start to engage with the client success team, the client implementation team. And the way that they've been able to organize that as they try to match up the client success organization with specific sales -- enterprise sales people so that there's consistency in the experience that the clients have moving into implementation. And then they have, I think, a very good and scaled client success organization. So we like that model because it kind of creates kind of an umbrella go-to-market and client service capabilities across multiple products. And so as we bring Adenza into Nasdaq and we think about how we want to integrate that with our Market Technology business, with the Surveillance business, we think there's opportunities for us to really leverage that scaled model for the broader technology platform. And that then allows us to go in kind of towards the top of the house within the banks, explain our complete solution suite and then deploy our product teams appropriately into meeting their needs. So we're very excited about that. Sure. Yes. No, Alex, I'm not going to be able to kind of go into all these discrete details, but I would say this, the business is chugging along quite well. I mean, we had 47 new small to medium bank clients sign on in the quarter, and then we had the four. And so kind of the composition of ARR, we'll have to kind of unpack what you're asking and make sure that we can give you a more discrete answer. But generally speaking, it's generally healthy. I mean, we have good signings of the small to medium banks. We have good signings of the larger banks, and those will come online as we get later in the year. And you're right that, it's signed ARR, so they should be reflected there. And then, of course, in the Surveillance business also, we have -- as mentioned, we had 10 new clients. So I think we'll have to kind of work to make sure that we reflect that in a way that helps you. But I think that we said basically 20% growth in signed ARR year-over-year, so we'll have to understand more of your discrete question later. Yes. And I know you're in Europe for this week, so I have a feeling you're hearing that there. But I -- first of all, we don't use the name OMX anymore, because they are -- they've been part of the Nasdaq family for 15 years. So -- but our European trading -- our European markets business is an integral and strategic part of who we are. And I think that I can say that with great conviction. And the reason is that, number one, the European business, I mean, the Nordic business and the Nordic markets are, in my opinion, the shining star of Europe. They've got great retail participation. They've got great markets. They've got a great financial ecosystem that underpin the markets there. I think we've been able to show over the last five years a very healthy listing environment. We also have great data sales of the Nordic data. And then we also had a trading business, because that business is comprised of all three of those components. We also have deep relationships across the Nordic banks and brokerage firms. We see that team that's in Europe sits right next to our Market Technology team. And so, the expertise that they have in running their own market, they are often deployed with our Market Tech team to go help and develop other markets around the world. We'll bring them out into markets all over the world and help them, let's say, develop their surveillance programs, help them understand market structure, think about auctions and things like that. So that team is integral to the Market Tech team and helping us sell and expand our technology around the world. And then also culturally, they've been obviously a leader in ESG. They've brought that ESG culture into Nasdaq. They helped us think about designing products that we now provide to our corporates to help them manage the complexities there. And then we have Puro.earth, which is our carbon removal marketplace that helps corporates meet their net zero commitment. So it is an integral part of who we are. And then the last thing I would say is, we've been on a very specific path to integrate -- to make our technologies more consistent between the US markets and the European markets. We launched our, what we call our Fusion platform, which I love that name because it is, in fact, fusing our technologies across our markets. And we've deployed that in the Nordic through this market. We're now deploying that across our US options markets. All of our surrounding systems have become consistent. And so, we're going to be able to demonstrate over time even more scalability across our markets business as we continue to combine that technology. So as you can tell, it's a big part of who we are. We're really proud and pleased to be integrated into the Nordic business as our Nordic markets as we are. So hopefully, that helps you. Thanks, Alex. Yes. I actually would agree with that completely. So as we've talked about, when you're selling into some of these larger banks, the process of getting sales done tends to be longer. So you're right, if they kind of came together in 2021, they then had integrations. They had their own operational integrations they were implementing. They want to educate their sales organization. They have their whole enterprise sales model, I mentioned it before. And so, they are just now really starting to demonstrate how the cross-sells can work. I think they've had five cross-sells and now they've been able to add two more. So, they are starting to show that there is real potential here to cross-sell capabilities. And hopefully, that also means the potential to shorten sales cycles. Because if you have a master services agreement and then you cross-sell another product, the hope is that you can cut down on the contracting time. But it is just beginning in terms of showing how they can open up doors. And the other thing to mention is on Page 3 of the supplement, we show you the revenue composition by bank tier or by client tier, and you can kind of see that they're different, right, from between Calypso and Axiom, but they're selling into all of those tiers, both of them. But they have certain strengths in different tiers. And so, as we think about the power of bringing those two platforms together and then the power of bringing our ASC capabilities and our Market Tech with it, you can kind of think about how we can help each other grow and expand in those tiers where they may be less penetrated. So that's obviously part of our investment thesis as well. Yes, sure. They are gaining share. So that's really exciting to see. And they are, in fact, winning -- they're winning mandates from companies that have competitors. So, that is kind of how -- obviously, how they're winning share. So I think that, that's a very -- that's an exciting part of why we really like their business. They have -- unlike some of their competitors, they're very modular. So they can go in and with one module to kind of breakthrough to a client and then demonstrate their value and then start to expand across other modules, which then allows them to say, you know what, we can do that for you instead of this competitor. We can do this for you instead of that competitor. And they start to penetrate the client by gaining share as well as reducing their internal spend. And frankly, that's a strategy that we're seeing really successfully play out within Verafin as well. So we do know that strategy can be very effective. Within Verafin, just to digress for one second, we penetrated one of the clients that we went into on the Tier 2s, we went in just showing them our alerting capabilities. And they then said, \"Well, wait, your workflow is so much better than what we have. Let me actually -- we're going to use not only your learning, but we're going to use your workflows as well.\" And now they want to -- and that was on AML and now they want to kind of look over on the fraud side. And they have existing systems in fraud, but they realized just how, frankly, awesome our platform is. So it allows us to go in and land and then expand by potentially taking out competitors. And I think -- I also think that Calypso and Axiom, the teams, they don't stand still. They're adding new capabilities that will, obviously, continue to grow the market opportunity. And an example of that is that Calypso, in the last few years have moved into the buy side. And not just opening up a whole new segment, client segment, they went from like three to -- I don't want to say the wrong thing, but like 3% to 14% of their revenue coming from the buy side just in the last few years, so that's a growth area. And then lastly, as they're deploying their solutions in cloud, so 53% of their sales this year so far have been cloud-deployed modules. That actually allows them to be a managed service provider, which then, of course, allows them to take a bigger share of wallet as they're managing the product and not just deploying it. So those are all the reasons why we think the revenue growth is highly sustainable. Thank you. Sure. Yes. We have not seen any sort of volume-driven contracts like that. So it's really a -- just think of it as a licensed service maintenance and/or cloud delivered subscription. So they don't have volume kickers within their contracts as far as we know. I think it is much more of a traditional software business. Hopefully, that answers your question, your specific question. Yes. I try to avoid the word forever. But I would say that what we've chosen to do is really halt our efforts in deploying a custody solution and as a custodian, I should say, like being a custodian in the US crypto marketplace. And the regulatory environment is fast changing, right? It's at least trying to evolve into something that's understandable. Let's see how it does over the next several months and so I think -- and maybe years. But we like to operate in environments that have a pretty well-known regulatory underpinning. That's just where we're comfortable. It's consistent with our risk tolerance. It's consistent with how we know we can be successful. And the regulatory nature of the business has evolved a lot. And the lack of clarity, I think, has made it to that. As we looked at the opportunity set of just being a custodian, nothing else like just that one segment of the business. Just the fundamental business opportunity changed over the last several months and then the regulatory overlay and kind of overhang changed as well. And I think that just made us decide that it's not the right time for us to enter that business. Will we ever enter that business? It's possible, but we'd likely do it in connection with other things we might want to try to do in the digital asset space. But right now, our focus is really on being a great technology provider, helping our clients with their potential for ETF listings, Bitcoin ETF listings, and continuing to provide Index solutions in the crypto currency space. Well, I won't give a projection. But I would say that, obviously, as the business is going well. But recognize that AFC is a combination of Surveillance and Verafin, and Surveillance had a little bit of a slower start of the year. And so obviously, I think it's shown that really great strength in the second quarter. And so there are going to be ebbs and flows, and that's why we give you more of a range. Let me give you an absolute number. We give that 18% to 23% range because there are going to be periods of time where we may be able to speed up as we sign more of the larger deals and then we may have more of a lull within a quarter or two. So I would have to say, I think that we feel good about the range we provided you. We're very excited about the strength of showing both -- all the new sales, both within Surveillance and Verafin in this quarter. But I think, Brian, it's going to ebb and flow just a little bit. It is a SaaS business, so it's not going to ebb and flow too much, but that's why we give you the range. Great. Thank you, and thanks very much for your time today. We are excited to continue to update you on all of our progress in our business, while we also prepare for our next chapter with Adenza as part of the Nasdaq organization. So thanks for all your questions, and I hope you all have a great day. Thank you. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. Before getting to our second quarter results, I would like to comment on strategic activities across the company. Starting with the divestiture of our power trading business in Europe, we do not expect the recently announced sale of the business to have a material impact on our financials, and we plan to include historical results for this business in the Corporate and Other portion of our financials starting next quarter. Once all open interest is transferred, we expect the sale to reduce annual revenues and expenses by approximately $35 million and -- $35 million and $20 million, respectively. Turning now to Adenza. We have seen Adenza continue its strong execution across both new customer wins and cross-selling activity. These new customer wins and expansions contributed to Adenza, achieving year-over-year ARR growth in the high teens with both Calypso and Axiom each delivering solid double-digit ARR growth over the past year. We have provided a supplemental information deck that includes information about Adenza's business and recent performance to help further illustrate Adenza's continued strong momentum. As we embark on our integration planning with the Adenza team, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on the $80 million in net cost synergies by the end of year to post-closing. In order to provide our shareholders transparency into our progress in achieving our Adenza related expense synergies, we will disclose the one-time costs related to achieving our synergies separately from our existing restructuring program that we announced at the start of 2023 related to our divisional realignment. To finance the Adenza acquisition, we have secured financing for the transaction through a successful bond issuance in June, issuing $4.25 billion in US dollar denominated debt across two, five, 10, 30, and 40 year terms, as well as EUR750 million euro denominated eight year bonds. To enable us to manage our deleveraging plan we expect to fund the remainder of the cash component of the transaction with a $600 million term loan that we plan to issue just prior to closing, as well as commercial paper. The estimated weighted average cost of debt is just under 5.5%. To minimize the carrying cost of the debt prior to closing, we are investing the proceeds of the bond issuances in highly liquid and low-risk investments, and we expect the net carry to be less than 50 basis points at current market rates, which will be excluded from our non-GAAP result. With regards to our capital allocation priorities moving forward, as we work to integrate Adenza and optimize our business to achieve the full benefits of the acquisition after the closing, we will be focused on using our free-cash flow to generate return for our shareholders. Specifically, looking back to 2022, Nasdaq generated approximately $1.45 billion in operating free-cash. In 2022 Nasdaq returned approximately $380 million in dividends, which was 26% of free cash flow and we expended approximately $230 million to offset employee-related dilution. That left us with over $800 million in free-cash flow to use for other strategic and investor return activities. With the addition of the shares that will be issued to acquire Adenza, if all else stays the same, our dividend payment at the current payout of $0.22 per share will increase to approximately $510 million annually. We have also stated our plans to increase the dividend to achieve a 35% to 38% payout ratio over the next three or four years, which implies an approximately 10% CAGR in the dividend payout ratio over the period. We expect Adenza to generate approximately $300 million in unlevered pre-tax cash flow in 2023. We expect the debt financing for our planned acquisition of Adenza to result in annual interest payment of approximately $325 million, which is more than Adenza's current free-cash flow. However, as Adenza grows and as we pay-down debt, we expect incremental free-cash flow from the addition of Adenza to fund incremental debt repayment and share buybacks. Based on the 2022 results combined with the full year 2023 estimates for Adenza, we will have approximately $700 million in excess annual free-cash flow beyond our dividends and employee related buybacks and we expect that amount to grow commensurately with our earnings growth over the next three years. With the remainder of the free-cash flows over the next three years, our priority is to delever and bring our leverage ratio to 4.0 times within 18 months and 3.3 times within three years. The [G&A] (ph) ratios reflects the combination of business growth that drive increases in EBITDA, as well as debt pay-downs. Therefore, we will not provide a specific pay-down schedule. However, based on our debt maturity profile and the nature of our debt, we will have the flexibility to pay-down approximately $2 million between now and year-end 2026 without any prepayment penalties or other restrictions. While we don't anticipate needing that full amount to support our path to 3.3 times, we want to have the flexibility to accelerate and/or exceed our pay-down expectations if we believe is the best use of capital to drive shareholder returns. We will also execute share buybacks to help offset the acquisition-related share issuance and support EPS accretion. After the debt pay-down, we will focus on using the vast majority of our remaining free-cash flows to execute share buybacks. Our focus over the coming years will be to maximize the client and shareholder benefit we received from the Adenza acquisition. Therefore as Adena mentioned earlier, we do not anticipate making any significant acquisition-related capital allocation decisions that would deter us from sizable stock buybacks over the coming years. Turning to this quarter's results. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results and all comparisons will be to the prior year period, unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of US GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release, as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing second quarter 2023 performance, beginning on Slide 11 of the presentation. The 4% increase in reported net revenue of $925 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 6% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and stable Trading Services revenue and $4 million of net negative impact from changes in FX rates and an acquisition and divestiture. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 1%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was down approximately 140 basis points from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $350 million or $0.71 per diluted share, compared to $342 million or $0.69 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to Slide 12. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2.1 billion, an increase of 6.5% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $755 million, an increase of 11%. We are delivering solid performance despite low IPO volumes and elongated sales cycles in certain areas of the Capital Access Platforms division, which had a modest impact on the rate of ARR and SaaS growth this quarter. We are well positioned to deliver improving revenue growth as sales cycles normalize and capital market activity increases. I will now review quarterly division results on Slides 13 through 15. Starting with the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $5 million or 1%, with an organic increase of 2%. Trading Services organic revenue was flat, with higher US revenues driven by strong US equity capture and continued options volumes, offset by lower trading revenues -- European trading revenue due to lower volumes despite better share. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 5% revenue growth driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology. As a reminder, Trade Management Services revenue growth in the first half of the year benefited from testing revenue that we do not expect to recur in the second half of the year. Additionally, we will face tougher comps in the back half of the year as we cycle through strong revenue growth we had in 3Q and 4Q last year. And therefore, we continue to expect full year revenue growth for Marketplace Technology to be at the upper end of our medium-term outlook. ARR totaled $516 million, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 53% in the second quarter of 2023 reflects a 200 basis point decrease from the prior year period due to lower revenue resulting from lower European trading activity, with ongoing investments related to migrating US markets to the cloud and investments in new growth opportunities in marketplace technology. Capital Access Platforms revenues increased $16 million or 4%, with organic revenue growth of $15 million, excluding $1 million related to an acquisition. Growth in the division was broad-based for the quarter. Specifically, Index revenue returned to growth, delivering a 4% increase compared to the second quarter of 2022, primarily driven by a 9% increase in average AUM over the last year. Licensing revenues for future contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index declined 9%, reflecting a 28% decline in trading volumes, which was partially offset by higher pricing per contract. Second quarter revenues also benefited from improving futures revenue share related to meeting certain contractual milestones in the quarter. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $25 billion, including $10 million in the quarter. In Data, revenue grew by 5% due to continued strong demand from enterprise and international customer strategies, with growth in recurring data sales driving solid revenue growth. Listings revenue was flat year-over-year due to continued weak IPO environment, coupled with slightly elevated delistings, including SPAC. Workflow & Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting growth across our ESG, IR and Analytics businesses despite ongoing elongated sales cycles among corporates and asset owners affecting revenue growth in the second quarter. ARR for Capital Access Platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 4% compared to the prior year period, which reflected a significant slowdown in new listings and the impact of continuing elongated sales cycles. The division operating margin was 55% in the second quarter of 2023, a decrease of 200 basis points from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $14 million or 19% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 19% in the period. The growth reflects robust demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Specifically, our Fraud Detection and AML solutions revenues grew 23% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Surveillance revenues grew 13% compared to the second quarter of 2022, with solid growth in subscription revenues from new and existing customers, partially offset by softer professional fees. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $339 million, an increase of 18% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed but not yet commenced totaled $365 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 36% in the second quarter of 2023 versus 27% in the prior year period, with approximately one half of the margin growth resulting from a benefit in our expenses due to a onetime adjustment to the incentive compensation program. Turning to Page 16 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $28 million to $441 million. The increase primarily reflects a $34 million organic increase or 8%, partially offset by a $6 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense reflecting higher headcount and technology spend as we continue making growth investments across the platform. Compared to the first quarter of 2023, expenses increased due to the timing of our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. However, this sequential increase was less than we expected due to the previously mentioned onetime adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program, as well as lower-than-expected hiring and client incentive marketing spend. We are narrowing our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance by $30 million to a range of $1.785 billion to $1.815 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range now represents an annual expense increase of just below 5% for 2023. The decrease in our expense growth expectations primarily reflects the impact of our decision related to the redesign of our digital assets offering as well as the adjustment to the ASC incentive compensation program. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the updated guidance range. Additionally, due to the timing of expected expenses, we expect a greater sequential increase in expenses in the third quarter than in the fourth quarter. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to Slide 17. Excluding Adenza related debt, our adjusted total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times, consistent with the first quarter of 2023, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrop. During the second quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $109 million. As of June 30, 2023 there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. In closing, today, Nasdaq's second quarter results reflect the continuation of the company's ability to perform consistently well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, sure. So if we're just looking back to 2022 and you look at it on an annual basis, we'd expect once we've closed on the sale that we see a reduction in revenues of around $35 million and approximately $20 million reduction in expenses. And what we do plan to do starting next quarter is reclass that out of the Market Platforms business into our Corporate and Other segments, you'll be able to see that decline as the sales closes."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I'd now like to hand the conference over to Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's first quarter 2023 financial results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Ann Dennison, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open up the line to Q&A. The press release and presentation are on our website.

I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I start, I would like to welcome Ato Garrett to the Nasdaq team as our new Investor Relations Officer. I know he's looking forward to meeting each of you very soon. I will now turn to my remarks today, which will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter performance and the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a review of our financial results. Let's begin with the current market landscape. Nasdaq continued to perform well, what was clearly a very dynamic operating environment, with a shock to the banking sector happening amid an already uncertain macro backdrop. During this challenging period, we delivered solid financial performance, while demonstrating operating and strategic momentum across each of our divisions. We achieved a new milestone for our anti-financial crime division with the signing in April of our first Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets for our fraud solutions, including the comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks, as well as case management and reporting functionality. We maintained our leading position in US cash equities and equity derivatives trading, while seeing strong demand for both our ESG services and our SaaS-based market technology solutions. Overall, the current uncertain financial backdrop highlights the value of our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions. In the first quarter, we also saw a generational technology breakthrough with the emergence of new artificial intelligence tools called generative AI. While the debate surrounding use cases for generative AI needs time to evolve, it is clear to us that companies that have invested in modern technologies, including cloud architecture and deployment, modern APIs and machine learning are poised to take advantage of this new era of technological advancement. At Nasdaq, we've been focused on investments to modernize our technology across our businesses, and therefore, we're well positioned to incorporate more advanced AI capabilities in the future. Against this evolving economic and technological backdrop, our team remained hyper-focused on delivering for our clients. Our results underscore our ability to navigate successfully amid a dynamic market environment and to deliver on our long-term commitment to provide world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy. Now let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. We achieved $914 million in net revenues, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period, an increase of 4% on an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in FX and an acquisition divestiture. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $646 million, up 4% from the prior year period, driven by organic growth of 5%, partially offset by the impact of changes in FX. Excluding the Index business, which declined by 10% due to a continued weak beta backdrop, revenues in our Solutions businesses increased 8% organically compared to the prior year period. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 7% to $2 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million for the first quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 36% of total company ARR. Across each of our divisions, we delivered well for our clients during the quarter. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $416 million in total revenue in the first quarter. Despite growth in data, as well as in workflow and insights, headwinds across our Listings and Index businesses resulted in flat organic revenue for capital access platforms year-over-year. Index experienced a 10% revenue decline and Listings was stable year-over-year. While our Index business continues to show year-over-year decline due to higher market levels at the start of last year, during the first quarter, we did experience a 5% improvement in average AUM from the fourth quarter of 2022. If the markets continue to demonstrate some level of recovery from last year, we should experience an improving year-over-year index performance as we continue through 2023. Data and Listing Services revenues grew 4% organically, driven largely by higher international demand for our proprietary data during the period. Our Workflow and Insights business revenue grew 5% organically, which reflects continued demand for our IR, ESG and analytics solutions, as clients navigate a dynamic and challenging market environment. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $413 million in total revenues during the first quarter, a 6% organic increase from prior year period. Amid a volatile capital markets environment, our core trading services business experienced strong performance in North American markets, where we saw double-digit revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in our European markets revenues, primarily reflecting lower value traded and cash equities due to market declines in a softer volume environment. In the US, we continue to provide our clients with the premier trading experience, while optimizing the revenue and capture mix for both US cash equities and multiply listed equity options. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both trade management services and market technology. During the quarter, we signed a Marketplace Services platform agreement with an innovative carbon trading platform in -- sorry, carbon trading marketplace in Latin America, as well as a new European risk modeling customer. We also signed a multiyear extension and expansion with a Tier 1 bank for our trading platform. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division, we delivered $84 million in total revenue in the first quarter, an 18% organic increase from the prior year period and a 16% increase, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down in the first quarter of 2022. Revenues in our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions or what we call our [indiscernible] solutions, grew 30% compared to the first quarter of 2022 or 27% excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The overall anti-financial crime business saw continued growth with 42 new ASC clients during the period. Our first quarter financial performance also illustrates the progress we've made to capitalize on certain growth opportunities that are aligned with three key trends that we believe are shaping the financial system. First, the modernization of markets where we can deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying market infrastructure. Second, the development of the ESG ecosystem, where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless roots to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives. And third, the increasing need for advanced anti-financial crime technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI, coupled with end-to-end workflow solutions for our clients. In this regard, I'd like to provide two highlights for the quarter. First, our focus on markets modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and the underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. From the successful migration of Nasdaq MRX, which is one of our six options markets to the cloud infrastructure in the fourth quarter of last year in partnership with AWS, we announced during the first quarter our plans to migrate our second options market to the AWS Edge Cloud by the end of 2023. Second, as financial institutions make investments in technologies to detect and fight financial crime, in early April, we are very pleased to sign our first global Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets to our fraud solution, including comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks as well as case management and regulatory reporting functionality. Additionally, we signed another Tier 2 client to our enterprise anti-money laundering solution during the period. These signings further demonstrate our ability to displace legacy providers and manual processes through our cloud-based and market-proven solutions. As we look ahead, I want to take a moment here to discuss in more detail the breakthrough developments in the field of artificial intelligence, which have captivated businesses across all industries concerning its applicability and impact. As a result of our years of investment in our cloud architected market solutions and SaaS applications, coupled with our recent acquisitions of advanced cloud-based investment analytics and anti-financial crime solutions, I believe Nasdaq is uniquely positioned within our sector to play a leading role with this technology in the future through the responsible deployment of AI to drive meaningful impact to our business, products and clients. To-date, we've been very intentional in migrating critical workloads and capabilities into a cloud environment with modern APIs to support client connectivity and functionality. We've also built unique data sets across various areas of our business. Both are foundational to our ability to leverage this generational shift in the technology. While we're just beginning the process of evaluating specific ideas for the use of generative AI in our products and across our business operations, we see compelling opportunities to lever broader AI models, including deep reinforcement learning, predictive control and computer vision across our business divisions to support our strategic efforts to enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the financial ecosystem. This is already happening in various elements of our business today. For example, in our anti-financial crime business, Verafin has integrated AI and machine learning into their solutions and capabilities since their founding 20 years ago. The combination of the advanced data sets combined with the self-learning capabilities of the AI and machine learning model is a key differentiator for the product. This improves the efficiency in the banking industry's daily compliance processes and achieved a step change in their ability to detect and stop money laundering, fraud and market abuse across their networks as well as to reduce false positives. In our Market Platforms division, we're in advanced stages of new product developments that incorporate AI, including new dynamic order types that improve our clients' fill rates while minimizing market impact. In fact, we've submitted for regulatory approval, our first AI-based market order or market order type, which is context aware, meaning that it is designed to incorporate awareness of market conditions on a real-time basis. As we seek out more ways to leverage AI across other parts of our business, we intend to take a principled approach to leveraging generative AI for the right purpose. Our data scientists and agile development teams will continue their research and development responsibly, so that our regulated and unregulated businesses can deploy this technology to create and maintain fairness across markets and develop more advanced solutions to fight crime. We look forward to updating you on our progress with these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to become the trusted fabric of the global financial system. Before I turn the call over to Ann, I'd like to offer some operating environment as we move further into 2023. When we gathered in January for our fourth quarter results call, we discussed some of the impacts and market driven headwinds that we are beginning to see related to the market environment and the uncertainty in the global economy. As we progressed through the first quarter, as we expected, we saw a decrease in the total number of operating company IPOs versus the prior year period, as companies put their IPO plans on pause while investors closely monitored interest rates and correlated inflation figures. Despite the slower start to the year, we maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings across our US and European markets in the first quarter. In the US, we welcomed 30 new operating company IPOs during the period for a 91% win rate, bringing seven of the top 10 IPOs by proceeds raised. In addition, there's a significant backlog of operating companies in the pipeline with 147 active operating companies on file with the SEC to go public and committed to Nasdaq, which is a 10% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 25% increase versus the prior year period. Our team continues to be in close contact with these companies, and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture future listing activity once the IPO window reopens. Beyond listings, we're still seeing elongated sales cycles in our Workflow and Insights businesses. As we previously observed, while overall interest in client demand for our Workflow and Insight solutions remains healthy, the process for some clients is taking longer as they escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval. Demand for our strategic focus areas, including our anti-financial crime solutions, our ESG solutions for corporates and our modern market solutions for established exchanges continues to be strong and largely unaffected by the market environment at this stage. Overall, we're very fortunate to have deep and trusted relationships with our clients who rely on us even more during complex operating environments. For example, during periods of heightened volatility, pensions and endowments often need to make swift asset allocation decisions to manage their portfolios, which can increase their reliance on our analytics solutions. Similarly, for our public company clients, these cycles can drive demand for our Investor Relations solutions as company leaders seek shareholder activity insights in real-time. As the global markets demonstrate sustained volatility, our market technology clients are focused on modernizing their market infrastructure to improve their agility and addressing client needs while improving \u2013 also improving the resiliency and scalability of their markets. And within our anti-financial crime business, the disruption caused by the banking crisis has caused \u2013 has resulted in clients moving deposits at unprecedented rates. Because of our cloud-based consortium data models, our fraud and AML solutions are instrumental in helping banks monitor payments and behavioral changes. These patterns underscore how our diverse pattern \u2013 our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions allows us to maintain our competitive strength through dynamic periods of uncertainty like we've experienced during the quarter. With our continued client engagement, coupled with the long-term investments we're making in our future, we remain confident in our medium-term revenue growth outlook for our Solutions businesses. And with that, I will now turn it over -- turn the call over to Ann, to review the financial details.\nAnn Dennison: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. I also want to extend a warm welcome to Ato Garrett as Nasdaq's Investor Relations Officer. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter 2023 performance beginning on slide 10 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $914 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 3% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 2% net negative impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 3%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was unchanged from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $339 million or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to $329 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to slide 11. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million, an increase of 11%. I will now review quarterly division results on slides 12 through 14. Starting with Market Platform -- the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $17 million or 4%, with an organic increase of 6%. Trading Services organics growth totaled 3%, with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. cash equity capture rate and higher U.S. equity derivatives volumes and capture rates, partially offset by lower European cash equities revenues due to lower industry volumes and market share and lower U.S. tape plan revenues due to lower collections from underreported usage. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology, which benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery during the quarter. ARR totaled $510 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 55% in the first quarter 2023 reflects a one percentage point increase from the prior year period. Capital Access platforms revenues decreased $3 million or 1%, primarily due to the negative impact from changes in FX rates with organic revenue growth of $1 million. Growth in the division was mixed for the quarter with a decline in Index revenue significantly impacting the overall growth of the division. Specifically, index revenue declined by 10% compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by an 11% decline in average AUM from near record levels last year. Transactional licensing revenues were flat as a 20% decline in trading volumes in futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index was offset by higher pricing per contract and favorable mix. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $23 billion. In Listings, we maintained our leadership position with a 91% IPO win rate for US operating companies. The Nasdaq stock market welcomed seven of the 10 largest US operating company IPOs by capital raise in the first quarter of 2023, including NEXTracker, which raised over $600 million in proceeds as well as the spin-switch of GE Healthcare. In data, we have seen an increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth in our ESG, IR and Analytics businesses. ARR for Capital Access platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin was 54% in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of one percentage point from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $12 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 18% in the period or 16% when excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down of $1 million in the prior year period. The growth reflects healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Specifically, our fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 27% compared to the first quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. Surveillance revenues grew modestly compared to the first quarter of 2022, as growth in subscription revenues was partially offset by lower professional fees. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $321 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed, but not yet commenced, totaled $354 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 27% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 21% in the prior year period. Turning to page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $8 million to $436 million. The increase primarily reflects a $20 million organic increase, partially offset by a $13 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and computer operations and data expense as we invest in our businesses. The higher compensation largely reflects our 2022 investment in new employees to drive long-term growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which featured higher sales activity to finish the year, expenses declined primarily due to lower marketing, travel and professional services expense. During the quarter, we completed the first phase of a review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We reduced our footprint and recorded an impairment charge of $17 million related to our lease assets and related leasehold improvements. We are updating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.78 billion to $1.84 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range is unchanged and still represents an increase of just over 5%, including 1% related to our digital asset strategy. The increase primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, anti-financial crime and market modernization. The second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants and therefore, we expect expenses to increase about $20 million from the first quarter of 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the guidance range. Turning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $290 million versus 4Q 2022 primarily due to a net paydown of $317 million of commercial paper, partially offset by a $26 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times down from 2.7 times in the fourth quarter of 2022, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrops. During the first quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million and repurchased shares for $159 million. The repurchases complete our objective to offset employee share dilution for the year. As of March 31, 2023, there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, we are announcing today a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share. In closing today, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Adena. And Good morning, Ann. I guess --\nAdena Friedman: Hey, Rich. Thank you, Adena, for giving us sort of a lot of info on the outlook of the business in the prepared remarks. But I guess if I was to zone in on the outlook in sort of the sales cycle businesses, the anti-financial crime and market infrastructure, you talked about the -- in AFC that there was a lot of deposit movement. But with that -- is that going to -- the deposit movement appeared to go to the large banks. How are you doing? And what's the outlook for the Tier 2 banks? And just a little bit more color, I guess, on the sales cycle with market infrastructure. Has that been impacted at all, I guess, by the market volatility?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Rich. So with regard to our AFC solutions, we generally are seeing a continuation of a normal sales cycle environment. As I said, we did sign 42 new clients to -- into our AFC business in the first quarter. And we do a lot of work across actually all of our solutions to look at what is our normal time to close, how do we engage with our clients, what does our pipeline look like? And as we've been looking across AFC Market Tech and as well as other parts of our Solutions segment, I think that we're finding a relatively normalized environment. Where we are seeing more elongated sales cycles are in our Workflow and Insights businesses, which really cover kind of our IR, Governance and Analytics businesses. But within AFC, we actually have a really healthy pipeline of opportunities in both Tier 2 and Tier 1 banks. We're really pleased to sign our first Tier 1 bank in April, and we signed another Tier 2 bank, as we mentioned in March, and I think that what we're finding is that we can really prove the value of our solutions very easily when we do proof-of-concepts with our clients. So in both cases, with the Tier 2 client, we did a proof-of-concept in our AML capabilities. And in the Tier 1 client, we did a proof-of-concept with our fraud capabilities. And in both cases, they saw a very significant value improvement in terms of reducing false positives and improving their ability to find real bad action -- bad actors, whether it's fraud or AML. And so I think that because we have this really strong return on investment thesis that we can prove out, it makes it easier for the banks to make the buying decision in, frankly, any economic environment. And so therefore, we continue to see really strong demand there. And the same within our Trade Surveillance business as well, we did have certain revenues in the first quarter of last year that helped amplify the revenue, so the growth year-over-year wasn't as strong. But the overall demand for our surveillance clients also continues to be quite healthy. And in fact, we've been actually focused on moving down market with our trade surveillance, because we're learning from Verafin that way. And we did sign our first Tier 3 bank to our -- first Tier 3 brokerage firm, I should say, to our surveillance solutions in the quarter. When it comes to Market Tech, we actually see very healthy demand across established exchanges. I think we're -- we definitely have seen a change in the demand characteristics for new markets. And we've been reporting on that since the beginning of COVID really where new markets have not been as much of a growth opportunity for us as we thought before COVID started. But honestly, the established exchanges, we're seeing really good demand, particularly in post-trade. Post-trade infrastructure has been a real focus for market modernization as well as risk management tools for both exchanges and brokers. And that's where we've actually seen a really, really healthy pipeline of opportunity. And we've been able to demonstrate strong growth in Market Tech in the first quarter. Again, we did have some revenues. I think our overall ARR grew 8%, but the business itself grew 11% in the quarter. So we continue to see really healthy demand there.\nRich Repetto: Thank you. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good morning, Adena and Ann.\nAdena Friedman: Hi.\nMichael Cho: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the AFC business as well. I mean, I know you talked about kind of still seeing a normal sales cycle in the AFC business from Verafin business. But -- just curious, longer term, again, just kind of given the banking situation in the US and just given that most of Verafin's current clients are SMB Bank, I'm just trying to get a better sense if you're changing kind of the longer-term focus from here? And meaning, is there going to be an increased focus on Tier 1s and Tier 2s, or is that still kind of a normal course of business? And then just kind of related to that, just in the quarter, revenues accelerated in the AFC business, but margins to kind of took a step back quarter-for-quarter, I'm just curious if there's any seasonal nuances. And maybe you can remind us kind of interplay of margins between the surveillance and Verafin businesses? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I'll answer the first question and Ann will focus on the second one. With regard to the overall environment with opening of the banks, I think, first of all, I would just say, we have about 2,500 banks and credit unions that rely on us today, but there are over 5,000 overall banks and credit unions across the US and Canada. So we still have lots of opportunity for growth and to find and land new clients. And so even if there are some unfortunate situations with banks as they're managing through a very really big change in the operating environment, we do feel like we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow and expand the business. And so far, we have an amazing team that supports the small to medium banks, and they're seeing a very normalized environment both in terms of new sales and in terms of renewals. So we're not seeing a disruption in the cadence of our business in that regard. And as I mentioned before, we did -- we had 39 new clients in the first quarter of last year and 42 this year. So we're continuing to show some really strong demand characteristics there. But the focus on Tier 1s and Tier 2s, there's a whole team just focused on that. So we've kind of -- we've done a really nice job of segmenting the teams. One team supports the small to medium banks, one team supports the enterprise banks, which are the larger banks; and then we have a team, obviously, supports surveillance, et cetera. And on the Tier 1 and Tier 2s, as I mentioned, the pipeline is really strong. So we have kind of an equal focus, I would say, on continuing to grow the SMBs while we focus on moving up market. And in terms of the margin quarter-over-quarter, I don't know if you have any comments, Ann?\nAnn Dennison: Yes, sure. I mean if you look at the margins quarter-over-quarter, there's the timing of how expenses come in. I think the better sort of way to look at it is look at the full year margins. If you look at full year 2021, we were roughly 28% and full year 2022 is roughly 26%, and you can think about that as sort of how the margins will evolve over the full year for 2023 consistent with 2022.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I think we've also said that we are really focused in this business on optimizing for growth. And so we want to make sure that we're -- as we're taking in more revenue, we're reinvesting that revenue to continue to really amplify the growth of the business. So the margin is wonderful, but it's also something we're really -- we are focused on making sure that we're investing in our growth there.\nMichael Cho: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just staying on the Verafin, surprise, surprise, but you mentioned that Tier 1 win, I think, Adena, you gave a lot of detail on the scope already, but maybe you can expand a little bit in terms of how much of the solution that you're providing is -- I mean, I guess, how much more up-sell there potentially is? Like how much of the potential capabilities are you selling? Can you give us a little bit of this -- can you give us some color on the size of this deal? And again, how that could grow over time? And then you obviously didn't disclose the win, but what we've seen in the past is once a firm like you gets like a big win like this, you're using it as a marketing opportunity. So just I guess just how do you think or how have the conversations already maybe changed now that you finally have one of those big banks because obviously, all of them talk to each other. So should that potentially drive the acceleration from here? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks, Alex. So actually, it is interesting to see the opportunity here. So we went in having conversations specifically on fraud detection, and they did a POC with us on that. And once they saw the quality of the outcomes, then they started to say, 'Well, let's look at the rest of the platform.' And so they didn't just take the detection capabilities and plug it into their platform, they actually had a collection or they have a collection of smaller platforms. And they said, 'Let's actually replace everything we do with fraud to with the Verafin solution.' So that means that we have fraud detection across all of their payment types as well as our workflow solutions. So our investigations, tools, our case management tools as well as our regulatory reporting tool. So it ended up being a bigger opportunity. But even with that, it was only for the US portion of the bank. So we do have an opportunity over time to move internationally. And they don't actually -- they're not using any of the AML capabilities that we have. So we also have an ability to continue to expand as they think more broadly about their anti-fin crime needs to take on more of our capabilities as we continue to work with them. We obviously have to prove ourselves with them that we are really great as great as we've been able to show so far and that we have a smooth implementation and those will be the key proof points. But we're already having conversations about how they can think about a broader use case. And that's actually what's exciting about going into the larger banks. Both Tier 1s and Tier 2s is that their needs are very expensive. We're going in with modules that really show like clear ROI, but as we engage with them and they start to see the broader platform, they start to think about how we can -- they can use us more. And so there is a really good land-and-expand approach that we can take care. And you're right about breaking through the barrier. Getting to that first Tier 1 win has been a very important milestone for us because now that we can prove ourselves there, it will make it easier for other banks to say, 'Okay, I'm not taking a risk here, I'm actually taking a proven solution.' And as you said, they do talk to each other. So we do see it as a way to help accelerate other conversations. I would just say, though, that it's not something where we have -- we're going to have the lining up to have every single quarter, we're going to have a great \u2013 a big announcement. But I think that we are starting to have a really good pipeline that will give us more of a regular cadence as we go further. And lastly, in terms of size, we don't disclose that. But I would remind everyone that it is not included in the Q1 signed ARR because it was signed in April. So it will be included in Q2.\nAlex Kramm: Very good. Thank you.\nA \u2013 Adena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. \nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. I mean, I would want to ask about AFC, but there are lot of questions already, but maybe we can switch gears a little bit too to AI. So Adena, you talked about there are many benefits of AI and Nasdaq has been leveraging this technology in many different areas. Maybe can you talk -- please talk about any additional area other than AFC and maybe modernization of the market you can further leverage AI? And then I think more importantly, can you also talk about, do we need some kind of regulations around AI so that bank actors are how accountable for using this technology? Thank you.\nA \u2013 Adena Friedman: Sure. Yes. It's been a big topic of conversation internally. We've had some fun with ChatGPT internally, by the way, with -- so we've had a good time like learning about it. But at the same time, it is quite serious in terms of where we see opportunities to leverage the AI across the business. So as I mentioned, we already are leveraging AI and AFC, and that's a very known use case for us. We have real opportunities also to bring more of that into our surveillance capabilities. And so that's been a really fun collaboration across Verafin and the surveillance team. We also have -- and I mentioned that we are starting to work with AI in our markets. And I would point to a couple of things. First, actually, on just managing our market infrastructure. We're using some of the predictive AI tools to be able to make sure that we're managing our -- doing capacity planning and managing our servers in a really, really dynamic way. And I think that's been really helpful to our infrastructure team in thinking about just managing infrastructure in general. But also on the markets and in the markets, we have our AI-driven order type, which is called Dynamic Melo, Midpoint Extended Life Order, that we have on file with the SEC. So, -- and then we also use machine learning for strike optimization in our options markets already. So, that's already a known programs in production that helps manage and -- manage the strikes across the options market because it's kind of a growing pile of strikes and you have to think about which ones are actually being used and optimized. But the other area where we're just starting to leverage the technology and find use cases is in the -- what we call in the Capital Access Platforms business. We've been doing some intelligent data scraping for our ESG business to help bring more information to corporates and to provide them more insights into the ESG characteristics of them and their peers. We also have just an incredibly rich data set across all of our insights and workflow tools. And so we want to find new ways that we can provide insights to investors and corporates to help them manage their business. So, we're just starting to figure out how we can use that there. And then we do already use natural language processing to help our analysts write reports for clients. So, that's an area that we've been using it for quite some time. Lastly, on the point of regulation, I think this next generation of AI has -- as you know, AI is a technology, it's a tool. It doesn't have a personality even though people like to say it does. It's really the people who use the tool that create the personality for good or bad. And we definitely see the opportunity for bad actors to use these tools and they don't have regulators. They're just -- criminals are not subject -- they don't subject themselves at least to regulation. So, it's really important that the regulators make sure that the good actors like Nasdaq and those that are trying to protect the system also have access to the same tools so that we can actually use the most advanced technology available to protect the market and to protect the financial system. And we do think that smart regulation is appropriate here. But also just really thinking about it proactively and embracing the technology for the right purposes, I think, is the right starting point for regulators to use, and we're already engaging with regulators and legislators on this topic.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the cloud migration and your AWS partnership. I was hoping maybe you can update us on the progress there, moving the markets to the cloud. It sounded like you're looking to move another options market by year-end. So, maybe you could just elaborate a bit on that, some of the milestones you're looking at over the next 12, 24 months? Maybe you could talk about some of the lessons learned from the journey so far and what sort of benefits you're seeing to revenues and expenses? And if not much, so far, what do you anticipate in the coming years?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Great. Thanks Michael. The partnership with AWS is going extremely well. And we've been really pleased with our first market, which is MRx going to the cloud. So, what we did experience is a 10% improvement in latency as we moved MRx cloud. And so -- and we can look at that as a direct comparison because we have one of our options markets already on our next-gen trading platform, which we call Fusion. And then -- but it's on-prem. And then we have a second options market in Fusion, but on AWS. And we can see that there's a 10% improvement in latency on the AWS implementation. So really pleased with that. But both of those markets, as we move them onto Fusion and with one of them into AWS, we are actually seeing better market share because of the fact that we have a more deterministic trading experience across both of these platforms. And then -- so we have seen a growth in market share across those exchanges. And I think that, that is highly related to the fact that the technology is as good as it is. And so we are really, really encouraged. So now we're moving our second market -- our third market on to Fusion and then moving it into the cloud. And then we also have a plan over the next several years to continue that progress. It gave us -- it's giving us confidence that we're moving in the right direction, and our clients are highly engaged with us. So we feel very good about it. We're not kind of trying to ascribe specific revenue to it, but rather knowing that this market modernization opens up opportunities or, as we pointed out, like new order types, new capabilities as well as a more scalable infrastructure. And over time, we will not have to do server refreshes, right? So that will start to show some real cost savings to us over time as we continue to bring the markets into the cloud.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to zoom in a little bit on the recurring revenue growth outlook as we sort of move through the rest of this year into next year in three businesses. It sounds like the Workflow and Insights, obviously, with the slower sales cycles, it's going to remain well below the medium-term target, I think of high single-digit to low double-digit. But at the same time, Marketplace Tech is well above that at least year-over-year in 1Q of that sort of low to mid single-digit pace. So question there is, are we going to -- or is it your view that we'll be tracking well ahead of that medium target in Marketplace Tech, given the momentum you had in 1Q? And then similarly for Verafin or Anti-Financial Crime and right now you're sort of at the lower end of that medium-term target, but with the Tier 1 and Tier 1 and Tier 2 implementations maybe if you could talk about how that might work its way into the revenue stream this year and including all the other new business that you're getting in that segment and whether we'll move back into that medium term 18% to 23% target growth rate this year?\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Brian. Well, as you know, we don't give specifics in-year guidance, so -- but I can give you some color commentary. I think that when it comes to the Workflow and Insights business, I think that we definitely are seeing, as we've said before, kind of a mixed environment there in a longer sales cycles. We are very engaged with clients, but the fact is that they have to go through more gates to get approvals. And of course, particularly in our governance area where we do find really good sales opportunities with IPOs, we don't have as many IPOs. So that also is hindering some of the growth across governance. But I would also say, we are continuing to manage the pipeline. We're continuing to engage. And we're hopeful that as the markets start to improve a bit, hopefully, the IPO environment gets more healthy. That gives us more opportunity and the sales cycle start to improve there. So we have some hope, but we also have to recognize the fact that it is a different environment right now and we're calibrating to that. With regard to the Marketplace Tech, we are very happy with the growth that we are demonstrating in the first quarter. I would mention that there are two things that are happening in that business that are creating some opportunities. So I mentioned that's 8% overall ARR growth in Market Platforms, which really reflects Marketplace Tech, whereas, we had 11% growth in the business. And the 11%, that delta really comes from some testing revenue we got in our Trade Management Solutions business and a delivery fee that we got in our Market Tech business. So I would kind of calibrate a little bit on that as you think about the rest of the year. And then the last on AFC, we were \u2013 every single quarter is going to be a little bit of a different answer, but I think that we feel very good about our overall growth prospects. Clearly, as we do move up market, it gives us higher TAM, right? There's a bigger TAM that we're going after, as well as the fact that the contract values are higher. So it does give us a chance to continue to demonstrate really strong growth there going forward.\nBrian Bedell: That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. You've delevered significantly, now have a fair amount of balance sheet flexibility. And just given that, I'm just wondering if you could provide an update on M&A? I guess, broadly speaking, it seems to be challenging to get deals announced still given the macro volatility. But I guess are you starting to see seller expectations come in or normalize at all, or do you feel the environment is turning more constructive to getting deals done versus where we were in the second half of last year? And then just any color you can provide on certain segments of the business where you're seeing the most interesting M&A opportunities right now?\nAdena Friedman: I'll actually start with the last question. I think, generally speaking, the way that we're thinking about the world. Well, first of all, as you know, we spend the vast majority of our time on organic growth. And I think because of that focus, we've been able to show continued stronger performance across the business. But as we do consider ways to expand our business, we have those three key themes that we're really focused on; market modernization and how can we bring more advanced technology to exchanges, banks and brokers to support their activity in the capital markets. I think the second is in ESG as we continue to grow and expand the capabilities we offer to corporates and investors in helping them manage the ESG landscape. And then the third is an anti-financial crime. And that's an area that we're always looking to expand at such a wonderful area of the business, and it's a high-growth area. But with regard to just overall environment around M&A, it -- I would always say this, great assets will always come in a premium. I think we just recognize that. I mean, in good times and bad, great assets will always do well in the M&A market. But I also think that as the market calibrates to a world where money costs money and the cost of capital has gone up. Obviously, we are calibrating our thinking on how we look at financial profiles of acquisition targets to reflect our higher cost of capital and we also want to make sure we're calibrating our expectations for the businesses that we would evaluate on that basis. And that can create some tempering of expectations. But I also -- we have a great balance sheet. We have done a lot to manage our debt. We've got really good -- really great cash flows. So we are in a strong position to consider M&A if and when we find something that we find particularly compelling.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks Adena.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, guys. Adena, congrats on the Tier 1 bank signing, but Actually, all my questions have been asked. So I think I'm good right now.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I was hoping we could talk maybe a little bit about pricing. We've seen obviously inflation for a persistent period of time now, expenses are rising across the board. And a number of your peers on the exchange side, but also on the data side have been trying to flex the pricing muscle where they can. So what are the opportunities on price that you see across the enterprise? Are there areas where you feel you're, sort of, below the market relative to the value proposition that you're providing to your clients, where you could increase pricing over the next, call it, 12 months to 18 months?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. So first of all, we do take a long-term view as to how we manage the prices of our capabilities and solutions. And so we do think that way. But at the same time, we also have within our contracts, particularly with our non-regulated businesses, we do have the ability to increase price to reflect the overall inflationary environment around us. And we do leverage that. So we have -- but we also tend to -- if it's a service where there's kind of an annual type of cadence, we tend to look at those price increases at the end of the year that then get effective at the beginning of the year. And so you're going to -- you're seeing that already flowing through the financials for 2023. I think that in the regulated businesses, it's a little bit of a different environment just because it's not only that we do want to make sure we get paid for our value, but we also have to go through a regulatory process to do that. And so that's just a little bit of a different dynamic. I would say, Alex that we're doing -- making the right decisions there where we feel that we have the ability to price up to reflect the value we're serving, we're doing it, but we're not overdoing it. We're not being as aggressive as we possibly can because we want to make sure that we're thinking about it over the long-term and not the short-term.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. \nSimon Clinch: Hi, Adena. Hi. And thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just explore the Index business this quarter and just how to think about things going forward? And maybe you could give us a sense then of, I guess, what you're seeing in terms of flows across the different product lines, where the real opportunities lie? And I'm particularly interested in the franchise outside of the straight QQQs as well?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we do provide information on flows at an aggregate level. So we did have $6 billion of inflows in the quarter versus last -- from the end of the year through the end of the first quarter. We also had $23 billion of inflows year-over-year. So we definitely are seeing good strong demand from investors for our Index products, and that's not just the QQQs, but also other thematic indexes, our smart beta index franchise. So we feel really good about overall client interest, investor interest. But obviously, the market dynamics have been what's really driven the downward trend in the revenues. I think also we're still out there creating product, launching product. We're primarily focused on thematic indexes, which really mean things that could be leaning into innovative technologies, leaning into specific trends in the industry. And so we tend to kind of put a lot of our new product development focus on those areas. And then we also have a smart beta environment like our Momentum Index franchise and some of the other smart beta indexes, where we definitely put time and attention there too, but I would say the thematic indexes have been more an area of new product focus for us right now.\nSimon Clinch: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show, our next question comes from the line of Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Bond: Hey, good morning. Just in regard to the crypto business. Did you see any impact from the recent banking crisis in terms of interest from potential customers? And thinking about the broader space, there are a number of players currently there and it seems to be some commoditization in terms of pricing. So, how does Nasdaq differentiate in terms of its offering in custody? And finally, is the launch still planned for this quarter? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks, Andrew. So starting with the last question first, again, on timing. I think that the way that we're positioning ourselves is that we want to get regulatory approval, and we're having constructive conversations with the Department of -- New York Department of Finance. And so we're hopeful we'll get that approval this quarter. And we want to get product ready by the end of the quarter. And with that, we're moving -- I think by May, we'll be moving into user testing on our platform. I mean, we'll be able to show kind of an end-to-end demo in production, which I think is going to be really helpful to curating our client prospects. And so -- but whether or not we launch is going to be more dependent on definitely whether or not we have regulatory approval and whether or not the product is a go. And also just making sure that we engage the clients, so that we feel really good about how we're going to grow the business over time. And so that launch is not set in stone. It's more a matter of making sure the other parts are ready first. In terms of the client engagement and the institutional interest, I do think Nasdaq has an interesting right to win here in terms of just getting engaged more generally in the crypto space as regulation starts to come into the market, and certainly, as the regulators get a lot more engaged in crypto, I think we do have an ability to come in with a fair, a resilient and a very scalable solution. Our crypto custody is actually, we would say, a real improvement in the technology. We are using MPC, but we're also using some really interesting techniques to make it so that we don't have this kind of hard hot cold wallet construct, but rather continuous wallet that's available, but hypersecure. And I think that we feel like that will be more attractive to institutional users to make it so they don't have a lot of their value stored in somewhere that's really inaccessible for, let's say, a 24-hour period. And so we do think that we have kind of a unique value proposition to offer. And we are having really great engagement with clients. But it is dynamic. I mean, it is a very dynamic environment. So we're calibrating our expectations to that. We're making sure that we're being very prudent in how we're managing our expenses in this environment. But we are quite excited about what we have to offer. So we're excited to be able to launch it.\nAndrew Bond: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is June [ph] on behalf of Dan. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to quickly ask about ESG. Just given some of the slowdown in the ESG investment strategies, are you seeing any impact from that on the demand for ESG service at all?\nAdena Friedman: No. So, most of our services that we offer in the ESG area right now are really offered to corporates. And there, we're seeing very continued engagement from corporates. We have both an advisory practice, which helps advise companies and how to make sure that they're thinking about their overall HD program, how they're reporting on their program and communicating it to investors. How they're making sure that they're being compliant with different taxonomies, so that they can get credit for the work they're doing. And that's -- the demand for that is very healthy. And then we also have our reporting tools that allow them to put all of that information to one container. And then we go and we map it out to all the taxonomies and all the rating agencies, et cetera. And that also continues to have really nice growth in client engagement. So, the corporates are wanting to make sure that they -- that they are there to engage with the investors the right way. I would say that overall, though, while ESG is going to have ebbs and flows in terms of kind of the environment that it sits in, it is, I think, a lasting change in how companies think about engaging with investors and how investors are making investment decisions. I mean the next generation of investors, do care not only what returns they're getting but how those companies are generating those returns. And I think that, we're going to find that that's a lasting trend. So, we continue to be very, very optimistic about how we can engage clients in this area.\nUnidentified Analyst: Helpful, thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to squeeze a couple of follow-ups here since we went over time. So thanks for letting me begin. So two things. One is a quick one and I think it is for Ann, back on Financial Crime. I mean you've been giving the signed ARR metric, and we only have limited history, but obviously, I think you can use that to back into net sales, which I think were $16 million this quarter, it was $6 million a year ago, so almost triple. So I'm not sure how meaningful those numbers are. But it sounds like you signed less Verafin clients. Maybe it's a Tier 2, is bigger. But like just maybe foot how that how that -- why the number was so big, because I think the first quarter is actually seasonally slow quarter. So maybe help us a little bit understand the numbers. And then just bigger picture. You have answered some questions around the operating environment and what's out there. But the one thing you didn't touch upon is that, clearly, there's a sizable bulge bracket firm looking to go away. So, just wondering how you think about that exposure there because clearly, their client, Credit Suisse, across a ton of different businesses of yours. So just wondering how we should be thinking about that? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Okay. So on the ASC side, we actually did have -- I remember the Q1 of last year was a particularly, I would say, a slower quarter than normal for ASC, but we did have 39 new clients then. This year, we have 42. So we do have more new clients signing up this year than last year. And as you said, the ARR associated with larger clients is going to be higher. So I think that, that helps also. I can't give you a complete bridge from the 6% to 16%. We're going to have to go back and look at that. But generally speaking, we have -- I think that, we are seeing some strong revenue tailwinds, as we continue to engage with clients and upsell and sell new customers. So I think that's really engaged [ph]. And also recognize that when we do renew contracts with clients, we don't charge -- we don't do annual increases, but we actually charge on renewal. And that also gives us an opportunity to upsell the clients. So that's been a pretty active environment on that as well this year. So I think that gives you, hopefully, Alex, some more color there. On Credit Suisse, the impact to Credit Suisse, first of all, it's going to take a while for us to fully understand how the two organizations are going to come together and how that -- what kind of impact it has on our capital markets business. But I would say that if Credit Suisse as we see trading moving away from Credit Suisse, it's going somewhere. And so we were continuing to see healthy volumes, help the liquidity. It's just that, that volume will probably move to other players. And then it's a matter of us making sure we're engaging with those players to get the flow. With regard to other solutions like our Anti-Financial Crime solutions, namely our Surveillance Solutions, that will be up to how they organize themselves to understand how we will continue to manage that contract going forward. We don't have a line of sight into that at this point. And I think those are probably our bigger areas of exposure to Credit Suisse right now, right, Ann?\nAnn Dennison : Great. Yes.\nAlex Kramm: Excellent. Thank you very much. \nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell : Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up and appreciate you going over on the time here. And also, Adena, a great, great comments on the AI strategy. It's really sounds compelling longer-term. Just wanted to understand on AI. How do you view that from an economic perspective? Is it -- are the innovation something that you can actually charge for across the businesses or is it more of the fact that it really enhances the product and, therefore, improves the sales cycle or capability? And similarly, on the expense side, do you view AI as creating better internally expense efficiencies?\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I take kind of all of the above. So that kind of depends on the solution. So there are going to be areas where we might be able to offer a specific bespoke solution at a premium price. There might be some areas where we -- like life with AFC, where it just creates a better product, and that gives us better sales opportunities. And we do -- we are very focused with our AFC solutions on being a premium provider of that. So -- and we see that because of the fact our value proposition is higher. So we kind of embed that into the overall price of the service. And then in terms of efficiency, particularly with generative AI, you start to have -- we've had some brainstorm sessions internally, and we say looking at generate AI in the business, meaning in our products offered to clients and then generative AI on the business in terms of how we manage it into our operations. And we see a lot of opportunities in both and in ways to create more scale and efficiency, but we also -- it's so early. So we have to also make sure that we're putting that technology into an environment that we feel is secure and safe and that allows us in kind of ring-fencing it and allowing us to make sure we manage our IP and our data. So we'll take some time to do it the right way and to find ways that we can be efficient, but also provide more premium product to our clients. And that's how we're focused on it right now. We also have a governance -- I should mention, we do have a governance committee that vets all the AI use cases inside of Nasdaq, and I think that's really important. We have to make sure we're doing this in a responsible way that we're thinking through the risks as well as the benefits. And so our governance committee is led by John Zecca, who is our Chief Regulatory Risk and Legal Officer, but also includes members from technology as well as other parts of our organization to make sure we're doing it in a responsible way.\nBrian Bedell : Yes. That's great. Super helpful. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Well, thank you very much for your time today, and we look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on the progress that we aim to make against our strategic priorities. And thanks a lot for your questions. Talk to you later. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for attending. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Before I start, I would like to welcome Ato Garrett to the Nasdaq team as our new Investor Relations Officer. I know he's looking forward to meeting each of you very soon. I will now turn to my remarks today, which will focus on Nasdaq's first quarter performance and the solid progress we're making to deliver on our strategic objectives. I will then turn the call over to Ann for a review of our financial results. Let's begin with the current market landscape. Nasdaq continued to perform well, what was clearly a very dynamic operating environment, with a shock to the banking sector happening amid an already uncertain macro backdrop. During this challenging period, we delivered solid financial performance, while demonstrating operating and strategic momentum across each of our divisions. We achieved a new milestone for our anti-financial crime division with the signing in April of our first Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets for our fraud solutions, including the comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks, as well as case management and reporting functionality. We maintained our leading position in US cash equities and equity derivatives trading, while seeing strong demand for both our ESG services and our SaaS-based market technology solutions. Overall, the current uncertain financial backdrop highlights the value of our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions. In the first quarter, we also saw a generational technology breakthrough with the emergence of new artificial intelligence tools called generative AI. While the debate surrounding use cases for generative AI needs time to evolve, it is clear to us that companies that have invested in modern technologies, including cloud architecture and deployment, modern APIs and machine learning are poised to take advantage of this new era of technological advancement. At Nasdaq, we've been focused on investments to modernize our technology across our businesses, and therefore, we're well positioned to incorporate more advanced AI capabilities in the future. Against this evolving economic and technological backdrop, our team remained hyper-focused on delivering for our clients. Our results underscore our ability to navigate successfully amid a dynamic market environment and to deliver on our long-term commitment to provide world-leading platforms that improve the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the global economy. Now let's turn to our results. I'm very pleased to report Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2023. We achieved $914 million in net revenues, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year period, an increase of 4% on an organic basis, excluding the impact of changes in FX and an acquisition divestiture. Revenues across our Solutions businesses were $646 million, up 4% from the prior year period, driven by organic growth of 5%, partially offset by the impact of changes in FX. Excluding the Index business, which declined by 10% due to a continued weak beta backdrop, revenues in our Solutions businesses increased 8% organically compared to the prior year period. Our total annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 7% to $2 billion. Annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million for the first quarter, which represents an annual growth rate of 11%. Our SaaS revenues now comprise 36% of total company ARR. Across each of our divisions, we delivered well for our clients during the quarter. In our Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered $416 million in total revenue in the first quarter. Despite growth in data, as well as in workflow and insights, headwinds across our Listings and Index businesses resulted in flat organic revenue for capital access platforms year-over-year. Index experienced a 10% revenue decline and Listings was stable year-over-year. While our Index business continues to show year-over-year decline due to higher market levels at the start of last year, during the first quarter, we did experience a 5% improvement in average AUM from the fourth quarter of 2022. If the markets continue to demonstrate some level of recovery from last year, we should experience an improving year-over-year index performance as we continue through 2023. Data and Listing Services revenues grew 4% organically, driven largely by higher international demand for our proprietary data during the period. Our Workflow and Insights business revenue grew 5% organically, which reflects continued demand for our IR, ESG and analytics solutions, as clients navigate a dynamic and challenging market environment. Turning next to our Market Platforms division. We delivered $413 million in total revenues during the first quarter, a 6% organic increase from prior year period. Amid a volatile capital markets environment, our core trading services business experienced strong performance in North American markets, where we saw double-digit revenue growth, partially offset by a decline in our European markets revenues, primarily reflecting lower value traded and cash equities due to market declines in a softer volume environment. In the US, we continue to provide our clients with the premier trading experience, while optimizing the revenue and capture mix for both US cash equities and multiply listed equity options. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both trade management services and market technology. During the quarter, we signed a Marketplace Services platform agreement with an innovative carbon trading platform in -- sorry, carbon trading marketplace in Latin America, as well as a new European risk modeling customer. We also signed a multiyear extension and expansion with a Tier 1 bank for our trading platform. Finally, turning to our Anti-Financial Crime division, we delivered $84 million in total revenue in the first quarter, an 18% organic increase from the prior year period and a 16% increase, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down in the first quarter of 2022. Revenues in our fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions or what we call our [indiscernible] solutions, grew 30% compared to the first quarter of 2022 or 27% excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. The overall anti-financial crime business saw continued growth with 42 new ASC clients during the period. Our first quarter financial performance also illustrates the progress we've made to capitalize on certain growth opportunities that are aligned with three key trends that we believe are shaping the financial system. First, the modernization of markets where we can deliver innovation that powers the world's economies and enhances the underlying market infrastructure. Second, the development of the ESG ecosystem, where we help companies and investors successfully navigate increasingly complex reporting frameworks, access more seamless roots to capital and achieve their net zero or sustainability objectives. And third, the increasing need for advanced anti-financial crime technology, where we can enhance the integrity of the financial system through emerging technologies, including cloud and AI, coupled with end-to-end workflow solutions for our clients. In this regard, I'd like to provide two highlights for the quarter. First, our focus on markets modernization continues to deliver innovation that enhances the liquidity and the underlying market infrastructure that powers the world's economies. From the successful migration of Nasdaq MRX, which is one of our six options markets to the cloud infrastructure in the fourth quarter of last year in partnership with AWS, we announced during the first quarter our plans to migrate our second options market to the AWS Edge Cloud by the end of 2023. Second, as financial institutions make investments in technologies to detect and fight financial crime, in early April, we are very pleased to sign our first global Tier 1 client with over $1 trillion in assets to our fraud solution, including comprehensive fraud detection capabilities across wires, ACH and checks as well as case management and regulatory reporting functionality. Additionally, we signed another Tier 2 client to our enterprise anti-money laundering solution during the period. These signings further demonstrate our ability to displace legacy providers and manual processes through our cloud-based and market-proven solutions. As we look ahead, I want to take a moment here to discuss in more detail the breakthrough developments in the field of artificial intelligence, which have captivated businesses across all industries concerning its applicability and impact. As a result of our years of investment in our cloud architected market solutions and SaaS applications, coupled with our recent acquisitions of advanced cloud-based investment analytics and anti-financial crime solutions, I believe Nasdaq is uniquely positioned within our sector to play a leading role with this technology in the future through the responsible deployment of AI to drive meaningful impact to our business, products and clients. To-date, we've been very intentional in migrating critical workloads and capabilities into a cloud environment with modern APIs to support client connectivity and functionality. We've also built unique data sets across various areas of our business. Both are foundational to our ability to leverage this generational shift in the technology. While we're just beginning the process of evaluating specific ideas for the use of generative AI in our products and across our business operations, we see compelling opportunities to lever broader AI models, including deep reinforcement learning, predictive control and computer vision across our business divisions to support our strategic efforts to enhance the liquidity, transparency and integrity of the financial ecosystem. This is already happening in various elements of our business today. For example, in our anti-financial crime business, Verafin has integrated AI and machine learning into their solutions and capabilities since their founding 20 years ago. The combination of the advanced data sets combined with the self-learning capabilities of the AI and machine learning model is a key differentiator for the product. This improves the efficiency in the banking industry's daily compliance processes and achieved a step change in their ability to detect and stop money laundering, fraud and market abuse across their networks as well as to reduce false positives. In our Market Platforms division, we're in advanced stages of new product developments that incorporate AI, including new dynamic order types that improve our clients' fill rates while minimizing market impact. In fact, we've submitted for regulatory approval, our first AI-based market order or market order type, which is context aware, meaning that it is designed to incorporate awareness of market conditions on a real-time basis. As we seek out more ways to leverage AI across other parts of our business, we intend to take a principled approach to leveraging generative AI for the right purpose. Our data scientists and agile development teams will continue their research and development responsibly, so that our regulated and unregulated businesses can deploy this technology to create and maintain fairness across markets and develop more advanced solutions to fight crime. We look forward to updating you on our progress with these opportunities in the quarters to come as we continue our journey to become the trusted fabric of the global financial system. Before I turn the call over to Ann, I'd like to offer some operating environment as we move further into 2023. When we gathered in January for our fourth quarter results call, we discussed some of the impacts and market driven headwinds that we are beginning to see related to the market environment and the uncertainty in the global economy. As we progressed through the first quarter, as we expected, we saw a decrease in the total number of operating company IPOs versus the prior year period, as companies put their IPO plans on pause while investors closely monitored interest rates and correlated inflation figures. Despite the slower start to the year, we maintained our track record for winning new operating company listings across our US and European markets in the first quarter. In the US, we welcomed 30 new operating company IPOs during the period for a 91% win rate, bringing seven of the top 10 IPOs by proceeds raised. In addition, there's a significant backlog of operating companies in the pipeline with 147 active operating companies on file with the SEC to go public and committed to Nasdaq, which is a 10% increase versus the fourth quarter of 2022 and a 25% increase versus the prior year period. Our team continues to be in close contact with these companies, and we believe that we are well-positioned to capture future listing activity once the IPO window reopens. Beyond listings, we're still seeing elongated sales cycles in our Workflow and Insights businesses. As we previously observed, while overall interest in client demand for our Workflow and Insight solutions remains healthy, the process for some clients is taking longer as they escalate buying decisions through more levels of approval. Demand for our strategic focus areas, including our anti-financial crime solutions, our ESG solutions for corporates and our modern market solutions for established exchanges continues to be strong and largely unaffected by the market environment at this stage. Overall, we're very fortunate to have deep and trusted relationships with our clients who rely on us even more during complex operating environments. For example, during periods of heightened volatility, pensions and endowments often need to make swift asset allocation decisions to manage their portfolios, which can increase their reliance on our analytics solutions. Similarly, for our public company clients, these cycles can drive demand for our Investor Relations solutions as company leaders seek shareholder activity insights in real-time. As the global markets demonstrate sustained volatility, our market technology clients are focused on modernizing their market infrastructure to improve their agility and addressing client needs while improving \u2013 also improving the resiliency and scalability of their markets. And within our anti-financial crime business, the disruption caused by the banking crisis has caused \u2013 has resulted in clients moving deposits at unprecedented rates. Because of our cloud-based consortium data models, our fraud and AML solutions are instrumental in helping banks monitor payments and behavioral changes. These patterns underscore how our diverse pattern \u2013 our diverse platform of mission-critical solutions allows us to maintain our competitive strength through dynamic periods of uncertainty like we've experienced during the quarter. With our continued client engagement, coupled with the long-term investments we're making in our future, we remain confident in our medium-term revenue growth outlook for our Solutions businesses. And with that, I will now turn it over -- turn the call over to Ann, to review the financial details. Hey, Rich. Thank you, Adena, for giving us sort of a lot of info on the outlook of the business in the prepared remarks. But I guess if I was to zone in on the outlook in sort of the sales cycle businesses, the anti-financial crime and market infrastructure, you talked about the -- in AFC that there was a lot of deposit movement. But with that -- is that going to -- the deposit movement appeared to go to the large banks. How are you doing? And what's the outlook for the Tier 2 banks? And just a little bit more color, I guess, on the sales cycle with market infrastructure. Has that been impacted at all, I guess, by the market volatility? Sure. Thanks, Rich. So with regard to our AFC solutions, we generally are seeing a continuation of a normal sales cycle environment. As I said, we did sign 42 new clients to -- into our AFC business in the first quarter. And we do a lot of work across actually all of our solutions to look at what is our normal time to close, how do we engage with our clients, what does our pipeline look like? And as we've been looking across AFC Market Tech and as well as other parts of our Solutions segment, I think that we're finding a relatively normalized environment. Where we are seeing more elongated sales cycles are in our Workflow and Insights businesses, which really cover kind of our IR, Governance and Analytics businesses. But within AFC, we actually have a really healthy pipeline of opportunities in both Tier 2 and Tier 1 banks. We're really pleased to sign our first Tier 1 bank in April, and we signed another Tier 2 bank, as we mentioned in March, and I think that what we're finding is that we can really prove the value of our solutions very easily when we do proof-of-concepts with our clients. So in both cases, with the Tier 2 client, we did a proof-of-concept in our AML capabilities. And in the Tier 1 client, we did a proof-of-concept with our fraud capabilities. And in both cases, they saw a very significant value improvement in terms of reducing false positives and improving their ability to find real bad action -- bad actors, whether it's fraud or AML. And so I think that because we have this really strong return on investment thesis that we can prove out, it makes it easier for the banks to make the buying decision in, frankly, any economic environment. And so therefore, we continue to see really strong demand there. And the same within our Trade Surveillance business as well, we did have certain revenues in the first quarter of last year that helped amplify the revenue, so the growth year-over-year wasn't as strong. But the overall demand for our surveillance clients also continues to be quite healthy. And in fact, we've been actually focused on moving down market with our trade surveillance, because we're learning from Verafin that way. And we did sign our first Tier 3 bank to our -- first Tier 3 brokerage firm, I should say, to our surveillance solutions in the quarter. When it comes to Market Tech, we actually see very healthy demand across established exchanges. I think we're -- we definitely have seen a change in the demand characteristics for new markets. And we've been reporting on that since the beginning of COVID really where new markets have not been as much of a growth opportunity for us as we thought before COVID started. But honestly, the established exchanges, we're seeing really good demand, particularly in post-trade. Post-trade infrastructure has been a real focus for market modernization as well as risk management tools for both exchanges and brokers. And that's where we've actually seen a really, really healthy pipeline of opportunity. And we've been able to demonstrate strong growth in Market Tech in the first quarter. Again, we did have some revenues. I think our overall ARR grew 8%, but the business itself grew 11% in the quarter. So we continue to see really healthy demand there. Sure. Hi. Sure. Well, I'll answer the first question and Ann will focus on the second one. With regard to the overall environment with opening of the banks, I think, first of all, I would just say, we have about 2,500 banks and credit unions that rely on us today, but there are over 5,000 overall banks and credit unions across the US and Canada. So we still have lots of opportunity for growth and to find and land new clients. And so even if there are some unfortunate situations with banks as they're managing through a very really big change in the operating environment, we do feel like we have plenty of opportunity to continue to grow and expand the business. And so far, we have an amazing team that supports the small to medium banks, and they're seeing a very normalized environment both in terms of new sales and in terms of renewals. So we're not seeing a disruption in the cadence of our business in that regard. And as I mentioned before, we did -- we had 39 new clients in the first quarter of last year and 42 this year. So we're continuing to show some really strong demand characteristics there. But the focus on Tier 1s and Tier 2s, there's a whole team just focused on that. So we've kind of -- we've done a really nice job of segmenting the teams. One team supports the small to medium banks, one team supports the enterprise banks, which are the larger banks; and then we have a team, obviously, supports surveillance, et cetera. And on the Tier 1 and Tier 2s, as I mentioned, the pipeline is really strong. So we have kind of an equal focus, I would say, on continuing to grow the SMBs while we focus on moving up market. And in terms of the margin quarter-over-quarter, I don't know if you have any comments, Ann? Yes. And I think we've also said that we are really focused in this business on optimizing for growth. And so we want to make sure that we're -- as we're taking in more revenue, we're reinvesting that revenue to continue to really amplify the growth of the business. So the margin is wonderful, but it's also something we're really -- we are focused on making sure that we're investing in our growth there. Great. Thanks, Alex. So actually, it is interesting to see the opportunity here. So we went in having conversations specifically on fraud detection, and they did a POC with us on that. And once they saw the quality of the outcomes, then they started to say, 'Well, let's look at the rest of the platform.' And so they didn't just take the detection capabilities and plug it into their platform, they actually had a collection or they have a collection of smaller platforms. And they said, 'Let's actually replace everything we do with fraud to with the Verafin solution.' So that means that we have fraud detection across all of their payment types as well as our workflow solutions. So our investigations, tools, our case management tools as well as our regulatory reporting tool. So it ended up being a bigger opportunity. But even with that, it was only for the US portion of the bank. So we do have an opportunity over time to move internationally. And they don't actually -- they're not using any of the AML capabilities that we have. So we also have an ability to continue to expand as they think more broadly about their anti-fin crime needs to take on more of our capabilities as we continue to work with them. We obviously have to prove ourselves with them that we are really great as great as we've been able to show so far and that we have a smooth implementation and those will be the key proof points. But we're already having conversations about how they can think about a broader use case. And that's actually what's exciting about going into the larger banks. Both Tier 1s and Tier 2s is that their needs are very expensive. We're going in with modules that really show like clear ROI, but as we engage with them and they start to see the broader platform, they start to think about how we can -- they can use us more. And so there is a really good land-and-expand approach that we can take care. And you're right about breaking through the barrier. Getting to that first Tier 1 win has been a very important milestone for us because now that we can prove ourselves there, it will make it easier for other banks to say, 'Okay, I'm not taking a risk here, I'm actually taking a proven solution.' And as you said, they do talk to each other. So we do see it as a way to help accelerate other conversations. I would just say, though, that it's not something where we have -- we're going to have the lining up to have every single quarter, we're going to have a great \u2013 a big announcement. But I think that we are starting to have a really good pipeline that will give us more of a regular cadence as we go further. And lastly, in terms of size, we don't disclose that. But I would remind everyone that it is not included in the Q1 signed ARR because it was signed in April. So it will be included in Q2. Thank you. Sure. Great. Thanks Michael. The partnership with AWS is going extremely well. And we've been really pleased with our first market, which is MRx going to the cloud. So, what we did experience is a 10% improvement in latency as we moved MRx cloud. And so -- and we can look at that as a direct comparison because we have one of our options markets already on our next-gen trading platform, which we call Fusion. And then -- but it's on-prem. And then we have a second options market in Fusion, but on AWS. And we can see that there's a 10% improvement in latency on the AWS implementation. So really pleased with that. But both of those markets, as we move them onto Fusion and with one of them into AWS, we are actually seeing better market share because of the fact that we have a more deterministic trading experience across both of these platforms. And then -- so we have seen a growth in market share across those exchanges. And I think that, that is highly related to the fact that the technology is as good as it is. And so we are really, really encouraged. So now we're moving our second market -- our third market on to Fusion and then moving it into the cloud. And then we also have a plan over the next several years to continue that progress. It gave us -- it's giving us confidence that we're moving in the right direction, and our clients are highly engaged with us. So we feel very good about it. We're not kind of trying to ascribe specific revenue to it, but rather knowing that this market modernization opens up opportunities or, as we pointed out, like new order types, new capabilities as well as a more scalable infrastructure. And over time, we will not have to do server refreshes, right? So that will start to show some real cost savings to us over time as we continue to bring the markets into the cloud. Thank you, Brian. Well, as you know, we don't give specifics in-year guidance, so -- but I can give you some color commentary. I think that when it comes to the Workflow and Insights business, I think that we definitely are seeing, as we've said before, kind of a mixed environment there in a longer sales cycles. We are very engaged with clients, but the fact is that they have to go through more gates to get approvals. And of course, particularly in our governance area where we do find really good sales opportunities with IPOs, we don't have as many IPOs. So that also is hindering some of the growth across governance. But I would also say, we are continuing to manage the pipeline. We're continuing to engage. And we're hopeful that as the markets start to improve a bit, hopefully, the IPO environment gets more healthy. That gives us more opportunity and the sales cycle start to improve there. So we have some hope, but we also have to recognize the fact that it is a different environment right now and we're calibrating to that. With regard to the Marketplace Tech, we are very happy with the growth that we are demonstrating in the first quarter. I would mention that there are two things that are happening in that business that are creating some opportunities. So I mentioned that's 8% overall ARR growth in Market Platforms, which really reflects Marketplace Tech, whereas, we had 11% growth in the business. And the 11%, that delta really comes from some testing revenue we got in our Trade Management Solutions business and a delivery fee that we got in our Market Tech business. So I would kind of calibrate a little bit on that as you think about the rest of the year. And then the last on AFC, we were \u2013 every single quarter is going to be a little bit of a different answer, but I think that we feel very good about our overall growth prospects. Clearly, as we do move up market, it gives us higher TAM, right? There's a bigger TAM that we're going after, as well as the fact that the contract values are higher. So it does give us a chance to continue to demonstrate really strong growth there going forward. Sure. I'll actually start with the last question. I think, generally speaking, the way that we're thinking about the world. Well, first of all, as you know, we spend the vast majority of our time on organic growth. And I think because of that focus, we've been able to show continued stronger performance across the business. But as we do consider ways to expand our business, we have those three key themes that we're really focused on; market modernization and how can we bring more advanced technology to exchanges, banks and brokers to support their activity in the capital markets. I think the second is in ESG as we continue to grow and expand the capabilities we offer to corporates and investors in helping them manage the ESG landscape. And then the third is an anti-financial crime. And that's an area that we're always looking to expand at such a wonderful area of the business, and it's a high-growth area. But with regard to just overall environment around M&A, it -- I would always say this, great assets will always come in a premium. I think we just recognize that. I mean, in good times and bad, great assets will always do well in the M&A market. But I also think that as the market calibrates to a world where money costs money and the cost of capital has gone up. Obviously, we are calibrating our thinking on how we look at financial profiles of acquisition targets to reflect our higher cost of capital and we also want to make sure we're calibrating our expectations for the businesses that we would evaluate on that basis. And that can create some tempering of expectations. But I also -- we have a great balance sheet. We have done a lot to manage our debt. We've got really good -- really great cash flows. So we are in a strong position to consider M&A if and when we find something that we find particularly compelling. Okay. Great. Thanks, Craig. Sure. So first of all, we do take a long-term view as to how we manage the prices of our capabilities and solutions. And so we do think that way. But at the same time, we also have within our contracts, particularly with our non-regulated businesses, we do have the ability to increase price to reflect the overall inflationary environment around us. And we do leverage that. So we have -- but we also tend to -- if it's a service where there's kind of an annual type of cadence, we tend to look at those price increases at the end of the year that then get effective at the beginning of the year. And so you're going to -- you're seeing that already flowing through the financials for 2023. I think that in the regulated businesses, it's a little bit of a different environment just because it's not only that we do want to make sure we get paid for our value, but we also have to go through a regulatory process to do that. And so that's just a little bit of a different dynamic. I would say, Alex that we're doing -- making the right decisions there where we feel that we have the ability to price up to reflect the value we're serving, we're doing it, but we're not overdoing it. We're not being as aggressive as we possibly can because we want to make sure that we're thinking about it over the long-term and not the short-term. Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, we do provide information on flows at an aggregate level. So we did have $6 billion of inflows in the quarter versus last -- from the end of the year through the end of the first quarter. We also had $23 billion of inflows year-over-year. So we definitely are seeing good strong demand from investors for our Index products, and that's not just the QQQs, but also other thematic indexes, our smart beta index franchise. So we feel really good about overall client interest, investor interest. But obviously, the market dynamics have been what's really driven the downward trend in the revenues. I think also we're still out there creating product, launching product. We're primarily focused on thematic indexes, which really mean things that could be leaning into innovative technologies, leaning into specific trends in the industry. And so we tend to kind of put a lot of our new product development focus on those areas. And then we also have a smart beta environment like our Momentum Index franchise and some of the other smart beta indexes, where we definitely put time and attention there too, but I would say the thematic indexes have been more an area of new product focus for us right now. Sure. Great. Thanks, Andrew. So starting with the last question first, again, on timing. I think that the way that we're positioning ourselves is that we want to get regulatory approval, and we're having constructive conversations with the Department of -- New York Department of Finance. And so we're hopeful we'll get that approval this quarter. And we want to get product ready by the end of the quarter. And with that, we're moving -- I think by May, we'll be moving into user testing on our platform. I mean, we'll be able to show kind of an end-to-end demo in production, which I think is going to be really helpful to curating our client prospects. And so -- but whether or not we launch is going to be more dependent on definitely whether or not we have regulatory approval and whether or not the product is a go. And also just making sure that we engage the clients, so that we feel really good about how we're going to grow the business over time. And so that launch is not set in stone. It's more a matter of making sure the other parts are ready first. In terms of the client engagement and the institutional interest, I do think Nasdaq has an interesting right to win here in terms of just getting engaged more generally in the crypto space as regulation starts to come into the market, and certainly, as the regulators get a lot more engaged in crypto, I think we do have an ability to come in with a fair, a resilient and a very scalable solution. Our crypto custody is actually, we would say, a real improvement in the technology. We are using MPC, but we're also using some really interesting techniques to make it so that we don't have this kind of hard hot cold wallet construct, but rather continuous wallet that's available, but hypersecure. And I think that we feel like that will be more attractive to institutional users to make it so they don't have a lot of their value stored in somewhere that's really inaccessible for, let's say, a 24-hour period. And so we do think that we have kind of a unique value proposition to offer. And we are having really great engagement with clients. But it is dynamic. I mean, it is a very dynamic environment. So we're calibrating our expectations to that. We're making sure that we're being very prudent in how we're managing our expenses in this environment. But we are quite excited about what we have to offer. So we're excited to be able to launch it. No. So, most of our services that we offer in the ESG area right now are really offered to corporates. And there, we're seeing very continued engagement from corporates. We have both an advisory practice, which helps advise companies and how to make sure that they're thinking about their overall HD program, how they're reporting on their program and communicating it to investors. How they're making sure that they're being compliant with different taxonomies, so that they can get credit for the work they're doing. And that's -- the demand for that is very healthy. And then we also have our reporting tools that allow them to put all of that information to one container. And then we go and we map it out to all the taxonomies and all the rating agencies, et cetera. And that also continues to have really nice growth in client engagement. So, the corporates are wanting to make sure that they -- that they are there to engage with the investors the right way. I would say that overall, though, while ESG is going to have ebbs and flows in terms of kind of the environment that it sits in, it is, I think, a lasting change in how companies think about engaging with investors and how investors are making investment decisions. I mean the next generation of investors, do care not only what returns they're getting but how those companies are generating those returns. And I think that, we're going to find that that's a lasting trend. So, we continue to be very, very optimistic about how we can engage clients in this area. Sure. Okay. So on the ASC side, we actually did have -- I remember the Q1 of last year was a particularly, I would say, a slower quarter than normal for ASC, but we did have 39 new clients then. This year, we have 42. So we do have more new clients signing up this year than last year. And as you said, the ARR associated with larger clients is going to be higher. So I think that, that helps also. I can't give you a complete bridge from the 6% to 16%. We're going to have to go back and look at that. But generally speaking, we have -- I think that, we are seeing some strong revenue tailwinds, as we continue to engage with clients and upsell and sell new customers. So I think that's really engaged [ph]. And also recognize that when we do renew contracts with clients, we don't charge -- we don't do annual increases, but we actually charge on renewal. And that also gives us an opportunity to upsell the clients. So that's been a pretty active environment on that as well this year. So I think that gives you, hopefully, Alex, some more color there. On Credit Suisse, the impact to Credit Suisse, first of all, it's going to take a while for us to fully understand how the two organizations are going to come together and how that -- what kind of impact it has on our capital markets business. But I would say that if Credit Suisse as we see trading moving away from Credit Suisse, it's going somewhere. And so we were continuing to see healthy volumes, help the liquidity. It's just that, that volume will probably move to other players. And then it's a matter of us making sure we're engaging with those players to get the flow. With regard to other solutions like our Anti-Financial Crime solutions, namely our Surveillance Solutions, that will be up to how they organize themselves to understand how we will continue to manage that contract going forward. We don't have a line of sight into that at this point. And I think those are probably our bigger areas of exposure to Credit Suisse right now, right, Ann? Okay. Great. Thank you. Yes. I take kind of all of the above. So that kind of depends on the solution. So there are going to be areas where we might be able to offer a specific bespoke solution at a premium price. There might be some areas where we -- like life with AFC, where it just creates a better product, and that gives us better sales opportunities. And we do -- we are very focused with our AFC solutions on being a premium provider of that. So -- and we see that because of the fact our value proposition is higher. So we kind of embed that into the overall price of the service. And then in terms of efficiency, particularly with generative AI, you start to have -- we've had some brainstorm sessions internally, and we say looking at generate AI in the business, meaning in our products offered to clients and then generative AI on the business in terms of how we manage it into our operations. And we see a lot of opportunities in both and in ways to create more scale and efficiency, but we also -- it's so early. So we have to also make sure that we're putting that technology into an environment that we feel is secure and safe and that allows us in kind of ring-fencing it and allowing us to make sure we manage our IP and our data. So we'll take some time to do it the right way and to find ways that we can be efficient, but also provide more premium product to our clients. And that's how we're focused on it right now. We also have a governance -- I should mention, we do have a governance committee that vets all the AI use cases inside of Nasdaq, and I think that's really important. We have to make sure we're doing this in a responsible way that we're thinking through the risks as well as the benefits. And so our governance committee is led by John Zecca, who is our Chief Regulatory Risk and Legal Officer, but also includes members from technology as well as other parts of our organization to make sure we're doing it in a responsible way. Thank you. Great. Well, thank you very much for your time today, and we look forward to continuing our discussions throughout the year on the progress that we aim to make against our strategic priorities. And thanks a lot for your questions. Talk to you later. Have a great day."

            "name": "Ann Dennison",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. I also want to extend a warm welcome to Ato Garrett as Nasdaq's Investor Relations Officer. My commentary will primarily focus on our non-GAAP results, and all comparisons will be to the prior year period unless otherwise noted. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will start by reviewing first quarter 2023 performance beginning on slide 10 of the presentation. The 2% increase in reported net revenue of $914 million is the net result of organic growth of 4%, including a 5% organic increase in the Solutions businesses and a 3% organic increase in Trading Services, partially offset by a 2% net negative impact from changes in FX rates and acquisitions and divestitures. Moving to operating profit and margins. Non-GAAP operating income increased 3%, while the non-GAAP operating margin of 52% was unchanged from the prior year period. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq was $339 million or $0.69 per diluted share, compared to $329 million or $0.66 per diluted share in the prior year period. Turning to slide 11. As Adena mentioned earlier, ARR totaled $2 billion, an increase of 7% from the prior year period, while annualized SaaS revenues totaled $729 million, an increase of 11%. I will now review quarterly division results on slides 12 through 14. Starting with Market Platform -- the Market Platforms division, revenues increased $17 million or 4%, with an organic increase of 6%. Trading Services organics growth totaled 3%, with the increase primarily due to higher U.S. cash equity capture rate and higher U.S. equity derivatives volumes and capture rates, partially offset by lower European cash equities revenues due to lower industry volumes and market share and lower U.S. tape plan revenues due to lower collections from underreported usage. In Marketplace Technology, we delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by strong results in both Trade Management Services and Market Technology, which benefited from testing revenue and a large project delivery during the quarter. ARR totaled $510 million, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin of 55% in the first quarter 2023 reflects a one percentage point increase from the prior year period. Capital Access platforms revenues decreased $3 million or 1%, primarily due to the negative impact from changes in FX rates with organic revenue growth of $1 million. Growth in the division was mixed for the quarter with a decline in Index revenue significantly impacting the overall growth of the division. Specifically, index revenue declined by 10% compared to the first quarter of 2022, primarily driven by an 11% decline in average AUM from near record levels last year. Transactional licensing revenues were flat as a 20% decline in trading volumes in futures contracts linked to the Nasdaq 100 Index was offset by higher pricing per contract and favorable mix. Additionally, we saw net inflows over the trailing 12 months of $23 billion. In Listings, we maintained our leadership position with a 91% IPO win rate for US operating companies. The Nasdaq stock market welcomed seven of the 10 largest US operating company IPOs by capital raise in the first quarter of 2023, including NEXTracker, which raised over $600 million in proceeds as well as the spin-switch of GE Healthcare. In data, we have seen an increase in proprietary data revenues, driven largely by higher international demand. Workflow and Insights revenue increased 5% organically compared to the first quarter of 2022, reflecting growth in our ESG, IR and Analytics businesses. ARR for Capital Access platforms totaled $1.2 billion, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. The division operating margin was 54% in the first quarter of 2023, a decrease of one percentage point from the prior year period. Anti-Financial Crime revenue increased $12 million or 17% compared to the first quarter of 2022. Organic growth was 18% in the period or 16% when excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down of $1 million in the prior year period. The growth reflects healthy demand for fraud detection and anti-money laundering solutions as well as our SaaS-based surveillance solutions. Specifically, our fraud detection and AML solutions revenues grew 27% compared to the first quarter of 2022, excluding the impact of the deferred revenue write-down. Surveillance revenues grew modestly compared to the first quarter of 2022, as growth in subscription revenues was partially offset by lower professional fees. ARR for Anti-Financial Crime totaled $321 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year period. Signed ARR, which also includes ARR for new contracts signed, but not yet commenced, totaled $354 million, an increase of 20% versus the prior year period. The Anti-Financial Crime division operating margin was 27% in the first quarter of 2023 versus 21% in the prior year period. Turning to page 15 to review both expenses and guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased $8 million to $436 million. The increase primarily reflects a $20 million organic increase, partially offset by a $13 million decrease from the impact of changes in FX rates. The organic expense increase is primarily driven by higher compensation and benefits expense and computer operations and data expense as we invest in our businesses. The higher compensation largely reflects our 2022 investment in new employees to drive long-term growth. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, which featured higher sales activity to finish the year, expenses declined primarily due to lower marketing, travel and professional services expense. During the quarter, we completed the first phase of a review of our real estate and facility capacity requirements due to our new and evolving work models. We reduced our footprint and recorded an impairment charge of $17 million related to our lease assets and related leasehold improvements. We are updating our 2023 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to a range of $1.78 billion to $1.84 billion. The midpoint of the expense guidance range is unchanged and still represents an increase of just over 5%, including 1% related to our digital asset strategy. The increase primarily reflects our continued investments to drive growth across ESG, anti-financial crime and market modernization. The second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants and therefore, we expect expenses to increase about $20 million from the first quarter of 2023. Assuming stable performance and exchange rates, we currently expect 2023 expenses to be near the middle of the guidance range. Turning to Slide 16. Debt decreased by $290 million versus 4Q 2022 primarily due to a net paydown of $317 million of commercial paper, partially offset by a $26 million increase in Eurobond book values caused by a stronger euro. Our total debt to trailing 12 months non-GAAP EBITDA ratio ended the period at 2.6 times down from 2.7 times in the fourth quarter of 2022, and there are no long-term debt maturities until 2026. With our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, including $1.5 billion of free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis, we continue to be well positioned to support growth in a variety of macroeconomic backdrops. During the first quarter of 2023, the company paid common stock dividends in the aggregate of $98 million and repurchased shares for $159 million. The repurchases complete our objective to offset employee share dilution for the year. As of March 31, 2023, there was an aggregate $491 million remaining under the Board authorized share repurchase program. Additionally, we are announcing today a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share. In closing today, Nasdaq's first quarter results reflect a continuation of the company's ability to consistently perform well across a wide range of operating environments. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Yes, sure. I mean if you look at the margins quarter-over-quarter, there's the timing of how expenses come in. I think the better sort of way to look at it is look at the full year margins. If you look at full year 2021, we were roughly 28% and full year 2022 is roughly 26%, and you can think about that as sort of how the margins will evolve over the full year for 2023 consistent with 2022. Great. Yes."

After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your first speaker to, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations at Nasdaq. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's Third Quarter 2024 Financial Results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website. I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description in our annual report on Form 10-K. We will discuss our financial performance using pro forma financial results and year-over-year growth rates as if we owned AxiomSL and Calypso in all comparable periods, recognized revenue ratably for AxiomSL on-prem contracts for all 2023 2024, excluded the previously announced one-time revenue adjustment recognized in the third quarter and also excluded the impact of FX except for AxiomSL and Calypso, which are not yet calculated on an organic basis. References to organic growth exclude the impact of FX and acquisitions. Reconciliations of US GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in the filing located in the financial section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll provide some perspective on the external environment, discuss our quarterly performance and review our progress against our strategic priorities. I will then hand the call over to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail. Beginning with the macroeconomic environment, internationally, major Central Banks have pivoted to lowering rates over the past several months to combat slowing economic growth. Notably, the European Central Bank has cut rates three times this year, which coupled with a solid labor market has helped the European economy stabilize in recent months. The US continues to show overall strength supported by the Fed's September rate cut and more recent services and labor data. Looking ahead, while the global macro environment remains fluid, which could lead to a range of potential outcomes, the US is currently trending toward a soft landing with additional rate cuts expected in the coming quarters. The current positive economic trends and outlook provide a constructive potential for sustained trading activity across our markets as well as a rebound in the global IPO environment in 2025. And as financial institutions continue to operate in a dynamic environment, we see consistent demand for our mission-critical technology. Against this economic backdrop, Nasdaq remains well positioned to deliver sustainable and durable growth across our diversified platforms. Now let me turn to our financial results. We delivered a strong quarter with 10% year-over-year growth in both net revenues and solutions revenue, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions growth. Total annualized recurring revenue or ARR grew 8% to $2.7 billion. Expenses increased 5% in the quarter, reflecting investment in the business, partially offset by synergy achievement, while our operating margin increased to 54%. We continue to make progress on the successful integration of AxiomSL and Calypso, which has enabled us to action over 80% of our net expense synergies target and our strong free cash flow generation has allowed us to continue to delever, resulting in a 3.8 times leverage ratio in the quarter. Turning now to our business highlights, starting with Capital Access Platforms. The division delivered 2% ARR growth and 9% revenue growth fueled by another quarter of strong index performance. Beginning with data and listings, we continued to see modest growth in data revenue offset by a decline in listings revenue due to lower listings activity and prior year de-listings. In the quarter, we experienced a modest uptick in listings activity in the US. We welcomed 33 operating companies, contributing to a 75% win rate year-to-date through September of Nasdaq eligible operating company listings. Additionally, we have listed 5 of the top 10 largest IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, including the year's largest listing to date, Lineage. We also celebrated a major milestone as we recorded our 500th listing switch to Nasdaq from our primary listing competitor, cumulatively representing approximately $3 trillion of market value. This year alone, we've attracted 16 switches, including prominent government technology contractor, SAIC, and legendary food manufacturer, Campbell's, reinforcing Nasdaq's role as the premier venue for listings in the US. In data, we benefited from new enterprise license sales, higher demand from heightened market activity and continued strength in international markets. Across Workflow and Insights, we drove moderate growth with strength in analytics offset by Corporate Solutions. In Corporate Solutions, the broader operating environment, including sales cycles has not materially changed. We remain focused on client retention and product enhancements to ensure Nasdaq is well positioned when the IPO flywheel resumes, as evidenced by the previously announced introduction of new AI features across our suite of solutions. Within analytics, we've seen increased activity and demand for our data and workflow solutions with the asset owner and asset manager communities. Asset owners are using more manager research products and new tools such as the recently launched Peer Benchmarking Solution, while asset managers continue to seek unique insights through our data and services. And finally, our Index business delivered another exceptional quarter of growth with $62 billion in net inflows in the trailing 12 month period, including $14 billion in the third quarter, resulting in $575 billion in average AUM in the quarter. This reflects the broad strength of our Index franchise, while we continue to drive innovation and expansion with 35 new product launches this quarter. Turning next to Financial Technology. ARR growth across the division was 14%, including 24% in Financial Crime Management Technology, 15% in the combined AxiomSL and Calypso solutions and 11% in combined Market Technology and Trade Management Services. Overall, we signed 39 new clients, 110 upsells and 2 cross sells. Moving to the specific subdivisions. We're proud that Financial Crime Management Technology debuted as the number one provider for managed services and financial crime on Chartis Research's industry rankings, representing a strong recognition of our leadership across the Financial Crime Management industry. From an operational standpoint, we've seen strong client adoption in our integrated GenAI Entity Research Copilot rollout, which now is in the hands of over 2,000 US Institutions. We signed 28 new small and medium bank clients for a total of 109 new small to medium bank or SMB clients year-to-date. We continue to maintain a robust pipeline of SMB sales opportunities with a particular emphasis on targeting larger clients in the segment. During the quarter, we also signed one international Tier 1 client to our wire fraud solution as previously announced. We are making solid progress on our push for Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients and continue to have a growing pipeline in this key cohort. Moving to Regulatory Technology. AxiomSL was ranked number one by Chartis in regulatory reporting for markets and securities, in part due to our extensive coverage across jurisdictions, as well as our expertise in adapting to complex regulatory environments. During the quarter, we maintained momentum across AxiomSL and Surveillance with seven new clients and 70 upsells. AxiomSL delivered two significant upsells as it signed its first local banks in India and in the Philippines that can serve as reference clients as we build new relationships in these geographies. Surveillance delivered strong ACV bookings in the quarter with growth across exchanges and market participants and we continue to advance our Nasdaq Trade Surveillance cloud transition as 64% of clients are now cloud deployed and 11 percentage point increase since the beginning of this year. We also continue to see sustained momentum in Capital Markets Technology with a total of 4 new clients, 40 upsells and 1 cross sell. This was a strong quarter across our market structure provider client segment as Calypso signed its 20th Central Bank client and Market Technology signed 1 new cross sell and 13 upsells. More broadly, as financial institutions continue to expand coverage across the assets and geographies in which they trade, we see constructive environment for continued growth across our solutions. The Financial Technology division has a strong global presence. In this quarter, I would like to highlight our progress in Latin America. We continued to increase our footprint in the region through an enhanced partnership with Nubank, which is now using AxiomSL to support its regulatory reporting responsibilities in Colombia. We also signed a significant expansion of our technology partnership with Argentina's leading stock exchange group, BYMA, which is an existing CSD client and we signed them to modernize its clearing technology through a cloud delivery of our next-generation clearing solution. Across Latin America, Nasdaq serves 10 marketplaces as well as roughly 50 banking and payment services clients, comprising a broad range of digital and traditional banks, local and regional players as well as Tier 1 global banks. We're experiencing strong new client growth and over half of our Latin American clients that have adopted AxiomSL and Calypso have sought to expand their partnership with us in the last 12 months. Across the exchanges in the region, clients are seeking to modernize critical infrastructure to serve the evolving needs of global market participants as well as their domestic clients, many of which are digitizing their own operations. Latin America is just one of the many regional economies where we're helping financial institutions better navigate regulatory complexity and the modernization of market infrastructure and we look forward to our continued international expansion. Turning to Market Services, where we're generating Alpha in a higher Beta environment, Nasdaq delivered a record third quarter with 13% revenue growth. The growth was driven by higher volumes across US and European cash equities as well as record revenue for US multi-listed options and proprietary index options. In US equity derivatives, our multi-listed options market share continues to increase over the course of the year. Additionally, US index options continued its high growth delivering another record quarter with revenue doubling year-over-year. Turning to US cash equities. Nasdaq's overall equity market share was stable and on exchange market share increased, while capture remained healthy. And wrapping up with European cash equities, our market share remained steady as members increasingly favored quality and retail participation increased. I now want to provide an update on our strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Starting with integrate, as we near the one year anniversary of the completion of the Adenza acquisition, I'm extremely pleased with our progress-to-date. The integration continues seamlessly and we're delivering ahead of plan on net expense synergies and deleveraging. Operationally, our teams are unified and delivering for our clients as One Nasdaq. As a testament of the combined benefits of Nasdaq and Adenza for our clients, Nasdaq was recently ranked number five in Chartis' 2025 RiskTech100. This is an early validation of the thesis underpinning the acquisition, as Adenza and Nasdaq placed 10th and 18th respectively last year. Nasdaq is in the early innings of unleashing the power of our Financial Technology division and we look forward to building on this momentum. We continue to make strong progress advancing our innovate priority. We reached a major milestone during the quarter with the completion of the rollout of AI Copilot tools to 100% of our developers. We also launched an internal GenAI platform that features custom built skills designed to enhance productivity and efficiency. In less than two months, we've deployed roughly 400 unique skills with nearly 50% of our employees engaging with the platform. Nasdaq also launched new AI enabled products, headlined by the expansion of Nasdaq Verafin's Targeted Topology Analytics, which provides new detection capabilities for terrorist financing and drug trafficking activity. Following an extensive beta program, the terrorist financing analytic is expected to be released later this year. Earlier this month, Calypso also announced a new methodology to conduct investment portfolio risk calculations and produce predictive analytics using an AI-based machine learning capability. This technology allows financial institutions to improve the efficiency of conducting the most complex trading and regulatory risk calculations with up to 100 times faster processing speeds. Beyond AI, we continue to innovate by expanding our suite of new products and capabilities. This is particularly evident in our index franchise, which is a true innovation engine within Nasdaq and was recently recognized as the best index provider by structured retail products. Partnering with our clients, we brought 35 new investment products to market, including seven insurance annuity vehicles, aligned with our growth with our focus on international adoption and eight options overlay products, where we see strong sustained interest from investors. We also remain focused on international expansion with 57% of new products launched outside the United States. In Market Services, we successfully migrated Nasdaq ISE to our next generation derivatives platform called Fusion. Today, four of our six US options markets are now running on Fusion, resulting in lower latency, higher throughput and overall increased productivity. And concluding with our accelerate priority, we continue to make progress on our One Nasdaq strategy driving 2 cross sells across the Financial Technology division in the quarter. The percentage of cross sell opportunities in Financial Technologies pipeline is now above 10%, driven by strong client engagement and the cross sell campaigns launched to-date. The pipeline spans across regions, client segments and product lines and we expect to build on this in the coming quarters. We will launch additional cross sell campaigns in the fourth quarter and remain on track to exceed $100 million in cross sells by the end of 2027. To wrap up, the power of Nasdaq's diversified business model enabled us to deliver another strong quarter headlined by our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions growth. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver on the Adenza acquisition thesis, Nasdaq has become a trusted partner to the world's financial system, poised to solve our clients' most complex challenges. We look forward to capitalizing on this momentum to deliver sustained profitable growth to our shareholders. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details.\nSarah Youngwood: Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. We're proud to share our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions revenue growth and we are also making excellent progress in integrating AxiomSL and CALYPSO. Notably, we have actioned over 80% of net expense synergies to-date. Deleveraging continues and is now down to 3.8 times and we're seeing strong traction with clients with over 10% of our fintech pipeline coming from cross sells. Let's turn to our third quarter results on slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion up 10% with solutions revenue of $904 million also up 10%. Operating expense was $543 million up 5%, resulting in an operating margin of 54% and an EBITDA margin of 56%, each up two percentage points. Overall, this resulted in net income of $429 million and diluted EPS of $0.74. Slide 11 shows the drivers of our 10% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 7.5 percentage points of Alpha growth on a net basis, driven by new and existing clients, product innovation as well as market share and capture. Overall, Beta factors contributed 2.5 percentage points of growth this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indexes and higher overall volumes in Market Services, offset primarily by delisting and downgrade. As shown on slide 12, we had ARR growth of 8%, with SaaS revenue growth of 17%. Notably, SaaS as a percent of ARR increased three percentage points to 37%. Let's review division results for the quarter starting on slide 13. In Capital Access Platform, we delivered revenue of $501 million up 9%. Data and Listings revenue was up 1% with flat ARR. Revenue from higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing was partially offset by the impact of delisting, downgrades and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the quarterly impact from initial listing fees to be about $3 million for the next three quarters. Delisting trends are improving and we have seen roughly 20% fewer delistings year-to-date through the third quarter versus the prior year period, suggesting that delisting should be less of a revenue headwind in 2025. Index revenue was up 26% in the third quarter, driven by $62 billion of organic net inflows in the last 12 months, including $14 billion in the quarter, as well as market performance, resulting in record average ETP AUM of $575 billion with features and options volume also up 24%. In Workflow and Insights, revenue was up 3% with ARR growth of 5%. The increase was driven by continued growth in innovative analytics products, mainly eVestment and Data Link, with particular strength for eVestment in the Asset Owner and Consultant client segments. This was partially offset by a continuation of the environment we have previously described in Corporate Solutions. Analytics had a strong quarter with revenue and ARR growth in the high-single-digits. Operating margin for Capital Access Platforms was 58%, up two percentage points. Looking ahead, our expectation for full year Capital Access Platforms revenue growth remains unchanged. We expect to exceed our medium term growth outlook range with Index expected to come in above its range, Data and Listing essentially flat year-on-year and Workflow and Insights expected to come in below its range. Moving to Financial Technology on slide 14. Total division revenue of $403 million was up 10% with ARR growth of 14%. The difference between revenue growth and ARR growth for Fintech and its subdivision is primarily driven by a decline in professional services fees, including a large 2023 market infrastructure client delivery and capital markets tech that converted to ARR and the timing of bookings and upgrades as well as the proportion of cloud bookings in RegTech. We had double-digit ARR growth across all subdivisions, which benefited from 39 new clients, 110 upsells and 2 cross sells in the quarter. Financial Crime Management Technology revenue increased 20% with ARR growth of 24%, reflecting solid revenue growth against a tough comp of 29% in 3Q 2023, a quarter that included higher professional services fees. This quarter, we saw a revenue mix shift from professional services fees to ARR due to successful on-time implementation from Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients. Additionally, we had minor changes in the timing of other client deliveries. Clients are actively showing they appreciate the value of our products, including new enhancements such as the GenAI Entity Research Copilot. This was evidenced by net revenue retention of 114%, driven by pricing, minimum churn, upsell and renewals. We are also making excellent progress with larger clients within the SMB cohort. New client signings this year have resulted in 30% higher annual contract value per SMB client year-to-date compared to the same period last year. Capital Market Technology delivered 8% revenue growth and ARR growth of 12% with four new clients for the upsells and 1 cross sell in the quarter. Calypso was up 14% and had ARR up 16%, including three new clients and 27 upsells. Notable deals in the quarter included Calypso signing its 20th Central Bank client and significant upsells in Asia. While there will always be timing impact with specific deals creating variation in revenue growth rates, demand for Calypso enhanced ARR remains strong with good retention rates, continuing momentum in our sales pipeline and consistent execution in our sales cycle. Together, Trade Management Services and Market Technology had 1 new client, 13 upsells and 1 cross sell. Combined ARR was up 11%, primarily reflecting the benefit of upsells and pricing. This included a record 14% ARR growth in Market Tech, which includes the conversion of the $11 million from a large implementation we mentioned last quarter into subscription revenue. That said, combined revenue grew 5% due to professional services fees in the prior year period. As we mentioned last quarter in Market Tech, the market infrastructure clients that contributed the $11 million of ARR this quarter had $27 million of professional services fees in the full year of 2023. This year over-year-headwind will abate in Q4 of this year. Additionally, with seven clients deliveries signed to-date and a strong sales pipeline for the rest of the year, we anticipate a solid recovery in professional services revenue in 2025. Regulatory Technology revenue increased 8% and ARR grew 11% with 7 new client wins and 70 upsells in the quarter. AxiomSL revenue grew 10% with 15% growth in ARR. The strong underlying performance including 1 new client win and 20 upsells. Surveillance grew revenue and ARR by 6% with 6 new clients and 50 upsells. Fintech operating margin was 44%, a one percentage point increase, reflecting both operating leverage and the benefit from realized synergies. Looking ahead at our 2024 growth expectation for Fintech. As we just discussed, we have strong fundamentals and ARR growth, which we expect to continue for the rest of the year. As a reminder, we maintain our expectation for combined AxiomSL and Calypso ARR growth in 2024 to come in within its medium term outlook range. For Financial Crime Management Technology, given revenue growth rates of 23% for the first half and 20% in Q3, we may end up a bit below 23% for the full year. That said, the fundamentals of the business, our competitive position and demand for our products continue to be excellent. We maintain our expectation for regulatory technology to come in towards the low end of our medium-term growth outlook. And for Capital Markets Technology, we expect full year growth to come in towards the low end of our medium-term growth outlook due to a shift in the expected timing of a Calypso renewal from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first half of 2025. Wrapping the division with the strong performance of Market Services, which had net revenue of $266 million up 13%. Revenue growth benefited from record US derivatives revenue as a result of higher volume and capture in US options and index options as well as higher volume and capture in US and European cash equities, partially offset by a year-on-year decline in US option market share and lower European derivatives capture. Of note, US tape plan revenue increased $4 million sequentially with $3 million reflecting cumulative audit and other one-time benefits. North America was a primary contributor to our site performance with growth contribution, including index option, option capture, equity capture and share and take market share. US equity market share was also up sequentially at above 30%. Market Services operating margin was 61%, a three percentage point increase. Moving to expense on slide 16. We had non-GAAP expense of $543 million up 5%, resulting in operating margin and EBITDA margin expansion of two percentage points each. We are tightening our non-GAAP expense guidance for the year from $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion to $2.150 billion to $2.180 billion. We have actioned more than 80% of our net expense synergies through the third quarter. The synergies we have actioned so far have resulted in a two percentage point reduction in our expense growth so far this year and we expect the two percentage points to remain for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased due to the integration of recent acquisitions as well as energy tax credit obtained under the Inflation Reduction Act. As a result, our non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in the quarter including the year-to-date capture. We now expect the 2024 non-GAAP tax rate that is one to two percentage point lower than prior expectations at 23.5% to 24.5% versus 24.5% to 26.5% previously. Under the current tax regime, we expect tax rates to remain generally in line with 2024 and future years. Turning to capital allocation on slide 17. Nasdaq generated free cash flow of approximately $300 million in the third quarter. Gross leverage decreased to 3.8 times from 3.9 times last quarter due to EBITDA growth and debt pay down. We paid a dividend per share of $0.24 or $138 million representing a 35% annualized payout ratio. We repurchased 1.4 million shares for $88 million to opportunistically take advantage of the attractiveness of our stock, primarily alongside the Thoma Bravo secondary execution. This allowed us to complete our program to offset the 2024 employee related dilution. We will continue to focus on deleveraging in the fourth quarter. As we approach the one year anniversary of the close of the Adenza acquisition, I am proud of our results and impressed by the team's performance in advancing the integration and powering Nasdaq's evolution into a Fintech powerhouse. We are ideally positioned to execute on our next phase of sustainable growth. With that, turning it to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So your financial crime management tech was pretty strong growing at 20% year-over-year, but it was below the medium term outlook, which is mid-20%. You said mainly because of the top comp and timing of deliveries or there is something else in there that we should be aware of? And how should we think about the near-term outlook for Verafin? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thanks, Owen. Yes, as we mentioned, the significant difference is really related to the professional services. As we move up market into the Tier 1s and Tier 2s, we're going to have more of an implementation element to those clients. And so there could be more revenue variability as we look at kind of both the timing of those implementations when they move from implementation to ARR and also the amount of implementation revenue that we might have in one quarter, one year versus the next. So in this particular quarter, we had two significant implementations well underway last year third quarter that drove up our professional services fees and now we've completed those implementations, moved them to ARR, but that also means that we're now in the mode of moving more of our clients into that implementation mode, but we just didn't have as much implementation revenue this quarter. So it's really going to have there is going to be some of that variability going forward as we continue to scale our upmarket business and that's something that we'll make sure that we provide disclosures on like we did today. In terms of our overall confidence in the business, we remain confident in our mid-20% medium term revenue outlook for financial crime management technology. We're very excited by the customer pipeline for the SMB space as well as demand for our solution among the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. And so with those, all of the opportunities ahead of us, we expect to continue strong growth over the medium term. And as we zoom in, as I mentioned, there are some revenue dynamics and moving up market that could create some variability, but we just feel that we're just extremely excited about everything that's happening in our business and continued momentum there.\nOwen Lau: Sounds great. Thanks a lot.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Adena and Sarah. I hope everyone's doing well. I have a follow-up on the Verafin question. First, I saw you signed up another Tier 1 client in the quarter. Was that the same client that you announced in the last earnings call in July? I think you cross sold it from Axiom or is this actually a new one? And then will this one start with payment fraud, because I think that's how most of the Tier 1s start with? And just the final one here is, with your existing Tier 1 wins including Citi, have you been able to upsell them after the initial signing or is it too early?\nAdena Friedman: Yes, great. Thanks, Craig. Yes, it is the same client and you are right that they're starting with payment fraud. And we are actively working with several of our Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients that we have sold to upsell them or to continue to expand our presence with them and they're doing active evaluations of additional modules that we have. And we have already upsold one of our Tier 2 clients, but we're actively working with them. I think they've been really, I have to say, I think their clients have been really happy with the results of the implementations and so that's obviously giving us nice tailwinds to discuss further enhancements or extensions of what they take from us. But of course those sales cycles are not instantaneous either. And so we're in the process of working with them to continue to show all the different strengths that we have, but it is a very, very active, an active conversation across several of our clients.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning. I was just hoping you could elaborate a bit on the cross sells campaigns, particularly with Axiom and Calypso, how that's progressing. It seems like you're about to embark on some additional campaigns in the fourth quarter. Maybe you can elaborate on what your plans are for that and what success might look like? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks. Yes, so far year-to-date we've had 7 cross sells, but that also does include Verafin sales to AxiomSL or Calypso clients, but across the Fintech division, 7 cross sells. And the campaigns are working well. Obviously it takes time for those campaigns to turn into sales, but we feel very good about what we've been able to see, in terms of bringing more Calypso capabilities to our market tech clients and vice versa, as well as bringing AxiomSL capabilities to our Calypso clients. And the two new campaigns that we're launching as we go through the rest of this year, one is we have a product called the Nasdaq Risk Platform, which is a real-time risk management platform for exchange traded products and we are cross selling that to Calypso clients. That actually we think is going to be very interesting because obviously as you know Calypso really focuses on our OTC instruments and then we have this great real-time risk management platform for exchange traded products. So it's a natural cross sell and we saw that as part of the deal. We knew that that was an opportunity and now we're launching a formal campaign around that. And then the third is, I mean, I'm sorry, the second one is AxiomSL global shareholder disclosures for global broker dealers. So there are new rules and requirements coming out on shareholder disclosures to the broker dealer community, which is both our market services clients and Calypso clients. And so we're definitely working on a campaign specifically on that. So those are the types of things that we're focused on as we expand our cross sell campaigns.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is [indiscernible] on for Ashish Sabadra. I appreciate you taking our question. I just wanted to double click real quick on the comments earlier. On the timing aspect, when you're onboarding these new clients, SMBs, Tier 1, Tier 2. Is there a time frame that we should think about on the ramp-up period? Is it quicker for new clients or sorry new clients versus cross sells? Or is there relatively the same amount of time between both? And just as a quick follow-up. Any kind of clarity you can share on the IPO market that's shaping out? And then maybe if there's any issues from the upcoming elections that are hurdles for any client perspective. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Okay, great. Sure. So on timing of implementation, as you can imagine, as you go from the smaller banks that we serve to the larger banks we serve, the implementations become more complex and therefore, take more time. And so as we write this year, first of all, in the small to medium bank cohort, we have signed more of that medium bank size company. So we had, that's why, as Sarah mentioned that we had a 30% increase in the ACV for the clients we've sold this year in the SMB space because they've been more medium-sized clients. And those implementations do tend to take longer than a small client. And we would say anywhere from kind of 6 to 12 months for that medium client, really depends on the client and the complexity and also the completeness of what they're implementing day one. With the large clients, like the Tier 1 to Tier 2, it could be anywhere also from like 6 to 12 months, but more like 9 to 12 months for implementation so far at least. And that's when you first land in the client. If you're upselling and going to a second capability because we've already built a lot of the integrations with their data lakes internally and a lot of the systems that they have, it can go quicker, but still, you're dealing with a large institution. So you have a lot of program management and project management. And we don't have a lot of experience yet on upsell there. So we're hoping that, that could be a shorter time to implementation, but it still is going to be fairly long. And that's why professional services fees becomes more of an element of our revenue as you're dealing with the medium banks and the larger banks. And that dynamic is just that we had a year-over-year comp this year that had more professional services fees last year. And I think it's just a timing issue. I mean with regard to the IPO market, the IPO market. Well, it's been -- we're seeing some green shoots. We had 33 IPOs in the quarter really proud to have a 75% win rate year-to-date. We have a lot of companies that are in our pipeline. It's been very active actually in talking to those clients, pitching the great benefits of Nasdaq. And you can feel that there's just a lot of pent-up energy and demand to want to come to market. And I also think that with a better rate environment, so as we hopefully continue to see the Fed moderating the rates and to get it more in line with inflation today, that we will also have a good robust economic environment. But I think you should assume that we won't see a lot going into the rest of this year just because of other noise. And even into the first quarter, it's usually not a very active quarter anyway. I think there'll still be some transition there. So we're kind of aiming towards seeing more momentum in Q2 and beyond, and we're hopeful that it could be a much more active year next year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a follow-up on the cross sell campaigns. The new campaigns that you're running in the fourth quarter from a revenue standpoint, how large is the opportunity compared to the campaigns that you're currently running? And then in the scope of just the overall cross sell campaigns that you expect roll out to get to that $100 million of cross sell revenue target by the end of 2027. Where do you think we are in that journey? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, great. Well, we don't disclose specific campaigns kind of the opportunities there, but they all contribute to the overall growth expectations for solutions, I mean, I'm sorry, for Fintech and every new client counts. So as we said, we're very early in our journey there. I just want to point out that 2024, we've had a very significant integration. We brought the teams together. We brought the operations together. We're putting all the systems in place. We've actually had a lot of progress and getting all of the, what I'll call, sales tech, rev tech and client success type of tooling put in place. And so we're really -- this has been a building year. And yet, even in a building year, we're delivering really well across Fintech. I'm so proud of the team for that. And we also have 7 cross sells. So it's early, early. We have more than 10% of our pipeline today is cross sell opportunities. We have always said that there's -- this isn't going to be a linear path to at least the $100 million, we say exceeding $100 million. So it's not going to be a linear path. But we do expect that momentum will build over the next couple of years. As you know, sales cycles in these mission-critical technology solutions is not short. So you're talking anywhere. We've had a couple where we've had like a few months of -- from first conversation to signing, but most of the deals take like 9 to 12 months to get signed and started in terms of implementation.\nPatrick Moley: Thank you.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Just want to focus in a bit more on the international opportunity for Axiom. You noted the first clients in certain geographies in India, the Philippines, you also noted success in Colombia and Latin America. I guess, can you help us frame the international opportunity here when you look at your market share or penetration rate in more developed markets? And then, therefore, how meaningful some of these new international markets could be or maybe even frame the international growth rate within Axiom. And then just also if you could frame or give us some more color as to whether you're displacing any competitors in these international markets or if it's really just displacing the in-house regulatory reporting functionality?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Okay. So the first thing is AxiomSL is global today. But you're right that there are certain geographies where AxiomSL is really, really strong and then there are certain geographies where I think Nasdaq is bringing them into geographies where we're strong. So the Philippines is one example where we are the provider of technology to the exchange there. We have good relationships with the financial community there and with the central regulators there. And so it gives us a great opportunity to go in and really engage the financial, the banks within that space to help them manage their regulatory needs. And the difference is like it could be that a bank, for instance, the bank in Philippines was an upsell. We said it was an upsell because they already may have used AxiomSL for international reporting, but they weren't using it for domestic reporting. So now we've connected with them for domestic reporting and the same with the bank in India, which is really exciting. They were using us for reporting their international regulatory requirements, but not using us for the domestic. And now we are working with them to make sure we can deliver the domestic reporting requirements. And that, of course, in India could open up a huge opportunity for us. So we see these as really great land and expand just in country where Nasdaq has a strong presence, but AxiomSL may not have had a stronger presence. Latin America actually has been an area where Calypso and AxiomSL have been strong. And we are over the last 10 years, we have really built up a great presence in Latin America. I think that it has been a really fun it's been a fun way for us to engage with our clients there. We now have over 10 market operators and we have about 50 bank and broker-dealer clients that use our technology. So that's been an area where we've already had a presence. But what's coming up when I mentioned on Colombia was it's actually a Brazilian bank, new bank, which is a great digital bank there. I don't know if they're expanding into Colombia or rather they just realize that they want to use us more advanced technology to support their Colombian regulatory requirements. But we see them as a great client to work with because they're so pan-Latin America. And it gives us a way to expand our presence there. So it's pretty exciting. We do not give an international growth rate just because everything we do is kind of global in Fintech, but we'll consider how we can provide you disclosures there.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks, Adena.\nAdena Friedman: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. I just wanted to touch on pricing for a second. We can start on Verafin, but trying to get an update more broadly. There is a rollout of upgrades like entity research copilot or the new AI features and Corporate Solutions help with pricing from existing clients. And when we think about Axiom and Calypso, I know you mentioned some campaigns, but are there areas where you see broader upgrade opportunities ahead maybe in the context of pricing for existing clients? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. Thanks. Well, just before we go into specific features, the way that we work with clients and pricing is kind of a little different product by product within Fintech, just based on the way we work with them. But in anti-financial crime or in the sorry financial crime management technology, we really generally have a three-year contract terms. And then upon renewal, we work with the bank to look at how much they've grown, how much they're using our service, how much value we're providing to them. And with regard to the entity research copilot, we are not explicitly charging for that. But as we work with them and to see, we have half the clients, by the way, are actually using it. So we rolled it out to 2,000 banks and we're seeing that half of the clients are engaging that capability. So, so far, it's really great, getting some fantastic feedback from the clients in terms of the efficiency gains that they're getting from that. So that would be part of the conversation on the renewal and the upsell that we get on renewal in terms of pricing. And then with regard to the broader Fintech platforms, those tend to be three to five years is kind of the average terms for a lot of our products in that space. And we do actually have CPI escalation capabilities year-over-year. And then upon renewal, again, we will look at are we delivering more value to them and do they see that as a value creator that we can charge more for in the next contract. So I do think we have good ways to engage them in multiple dimensions on pricing, but we aren't choosing to charge explicitly yet for a lot of the AI capabilities, we're just adding value into the product. With Corporate Solutions, it's a little different. We have actually launched a new module within IR Insight that is a paid module, let's call it, sustainability lens that allows companies to compare their sustainability disclosures to other peers. And so those are the types of things where we might charge explicitly for, but not in every way. So we're doing board summarization in our board portal tool and that's just an added feature that will not be explicitly charged for. But we see that as a way to enhance retention and also get new sales. So, sorry, it's a long answer, but that's how we kind of we approach it.\nMichael Cho: That's great. Thanks for all the color.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments on the Market Tech business. It sounds like momentum is building. I think you said professional services should build into next year, but you still have the tough comp going into 4Q. So hoping to just contextualize that a bit more just in terms of how we think about 4Q revenues and maybe the growth into next year, putting those, the momentum versus the kind of roll off of certain contracts and professional fees that are still kind of rolling through the system.\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. Well, first of all, so I think it's important to note that we've given a fair amount of disclosure that we had that one client where we were doing -- we had really gotten to, I would say, a peak level of implementation with them last year in 2023 in terms of resources against that project. And that resulted in $27 million of professional services fees last year. That year-over-year comparison kind of starts to abate in the fourth quarter of this year, meaning, we won't have a tough year-over-year comp in that regard starting in the fourth quarter. And also, as you pointed out, we've had a lot of sales this year. So we've had a couple of new clients, but also just in the quarter, 13 upsell. So actually, we do have really great momentum there. And it's exciting to see as clients are really focused on modernizing their markets. They're really starting to understand why a cloud delivered or at least a cloud-ready solution is going to be important to their future. That's been a drumbeat that we've been discussing with them now for a few years. So it's really exciting to see that it's starting to turn into contracts and sales. The strongest uptake we've seen in our next-gen products have been in our clearing solution and our trading solution. And then also, we've had a lot of exchanges finally realize that their CSDs are decades old, and they're working with us to upgrade their settlement solutions as well. So it's been a good year. But as you said, it's a tough comp, that $27 million, that converted into $11 million of ARR as we got through the, I think it's right in the beginning of the third quarter. And we also feel like we've got good momentum going into next year that we think should be able to show you that we can get back to a growth certainly in the professional services and hopefully better growth throughout the whole business.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping to zoom out on Adenza for a second and just kind of talk about the near-term outlook you guys have for this business. There's been a few puts and takes, I guess, with the accounting change earlier in the year that, I guess, ultimately is meant to smooth revenue growth out a little bit. But as you look out into 2025, it sounds like the sales momentum is progressing nicely, and you're happy with the integration. So maybe talk a little bit about 2025 revenue growth expectations for both of those businesses, AxiomSL and Calypso. Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I think what we've said so far is, number one, we have -- we give you both kind of a medium-term outlook on ARR and overall revenue growth for the Adenza businesses kind of mid-teens ARR growth, low to mid-teens revenue growth. Everything we're seeing is consistent with that so far in terms of kind of how we've been progressing with the business and certainly how we've been delivering and the momentum we see is strong and active and healthy and consistent. So I think that's as far as we can say right now. But certainly as we've been looking at the business and evaluating its performance within Nasdaq, we feel like it's consistent with where we see the medium-term outlook.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead. Mr. Budish, your line is open.\nBenjamin Budish: Apologies, I had you on mute there. Just wanted to see if I could follow-up on Alex's question there. I know for Axiom, Q4 tends to be the biggest booking quarter and next year tends to be is expected to be a bigger upgrade cycle. So I'm wondering if there's any more color you can provide there? And maybe if you can sort of give more explicit guidance on what the revenue growth looks like. Maybe what is sort of like a reasonable expectation? What should we sort of see in a big upgrade cycle here? Should we see more professional services or more of an ARR acceleration? How should we be thinking about those different factors? Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. Sure. So well, first of all, I'm going to see how, I would just say demand in general is strong and active. Whether or not it's a bigger upgrade cycle for AxiomSL next year? I'm kind of thinking about that. I think it's more kind of Q4 like kind of coming into Q4 of this year. And you are right. We've had really good sales this year. So that should accrue to the benefit of professional services fees as we go through next year because we had a decline in professional services fees this year versus last year. We do see the opportunity for that to recover as we've had a strong sales year in AxiomSL. In general, though, I just want to point out, just remind everyone, as we've moved to ratable within AxiomSL, the ARR and subscription revenue should be relatively consistent with each other, not always. There are some differences and Sarah did a nice job walking through that on the teach-in a month ago, if you want to listen to that. The thing that can create revenue variability are the professional services fees that we've mentioned. And so as we look at how we've progressed through the year of sales and upsells, as you're talking about kind of renewing contracts, those things can be beneficial to us, and we see that as an opportunity for next year to have a better professional services year-over-year versus this year. I think that with Calypso, just to remind you, half of the contract value is recognized upfront when we renew a client or sign a new client. So that creates more variability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in revenue. But that's why we tend to really focus on ARR there, because that gives you the consistency of how we're doing and just driving demand and delivering. And again, that also can have year-over-year differences in implementations. But right now, you're seeing really strong sales there, really good momentum, and we're really comfortable with how that business is progressing.\nBenjamin Budish: Understood. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nWilliam Katz: Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions. Maybe if I could sneak in a two parter. Adena, for you, I'm curious no one's talked about it. I'd love to get your perspective on the recently passed Tick Rule by the SEC and what might be the implications either intended or unintended for the platform? And then, Sarah, I'm just sort of curious, maybe you covered this in your prepared remarks, it's been a busy morning. You gave a relatively wide implicit range for fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted expenses. I was wondering what would frame the high end versus the low end? Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, I'll answer the SEC Tick Rule and I'll hand it over to Sarah. So the tick size rule has been an interesting process with the SEC and we see the rule as having some benefits and then some concerns. Now in terms from a financial performance perspective, we do not anticipate that the rule will have any material impact on our revenues in our Market Services business. But when we evaluate a role like that, we really focus on two key parameters. One is just how does it improve the markets for investors and making sure that it really is something that will improve the experience that investors have. And then as part of that, how does it tighten the national best bid offer? So how does it make it so that the lit markets have a better ability to reflect supply and demand in the national best bid offer. And so if we unpack the contents of the rule, there are three things. One is the tick sizes. So they're narrowing the tick size to $0.005 from $0.01 for the smaller stocks in our market and we think that's good. That's good for market price discovery. I think that's good for the market. We call them tick constrained stocks where the lit markets, the exchanges have not been able to really reflect proper supply and demand in these smaller companies. And so that's a benefit to markets. The second component is just having odd lots be subject to price protection, which is small, but we think that's a positive also for markets. But the one area that we're really focused on, and we've been very consistent in our comments to the SEC is on the access fees. We had been suggesting and recommending that they look at proportionate changes to access fees. So for those stocks that have a penny tick regime, they should maintain the access fees. And then those that come down to $0.005 should have a change in the access fees commensurate. But what they ultimately did was take down all access fees by two-thirds. And that makes it so it's much harder for markets to incentivize lit orders. And so if we are not able to incentivize the market makers to put their capital into the lit markets, it will widen spreads, it could spin out the book. And that we see as bad for investors. And so we are definitely focused on that. The way, as you know, we have kind of access fees and rebates, it's not going to have a significant impact on us. It's really going to have a significant impact on investors. So we want to make sure that we are assessing that and evaluating that to determine what kind of next steps we're going to take there.\nSarah Youngwood: So in terms of the expenses piece, first of all, we did tighten it. So we're now at the range around the same midpoint on. And if you look at what could make it go lower versus higher, first of all, you have the revenue-related investments and there is always some variability that can happen in the fourth quarter, and it's a very important quarter in terms of like revenue. The next piece could be the timing of marketing and the margin, the timing of investments.\nWilliam Katz: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, Adena. Hi, Sarah. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondered if you could quickly just give a sense or talk to the renewal environment that we're in right now. It sounds like it's pretty good, but then you also referenced the push out of a renewal, I think, for Calypso by potentially up to two quarters which doesn't chime with, I guess, could talk about how what that actually means in terms of the renewal environment that would be good?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes. That's a very specific situation. So that's a long-standing client of very clients that we're actively engaged with. They've actually recently taken an upsell in Calypso. So we know that they are very pleased with the platform, but it really had to do with how they wanted to structure the timing against their renewal date and they've just decided to make that decision a little bit closer to their renewal date as opposed to doing it in advance, well in advance of their renewal date. So there's nothing to read into that situation. It's very specific. But because of the fact that half the revenue is recognized upfront on these license fees, it does have an impact just on the quarter and we just wanted to make sure we were very disclosive about that to help you understand kind of how to evaluate Calypso's revenue this quarter. But nothing to read into it. In general, the renewal environment is strong. We provide mission-critical technologies here. We have very high retention rates across our Fintech solutions and it's really just a matter of working with the clients and being responsive to them and their needs as they think about their renewal dates.\nSimon Clinch: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing the last question in the queue comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Thanks very much for squeezing me in. I'll be quick. Most of my questions were asked and answered. Just on the index options business. Can you just comment on what you're seeing as the revenue contribution from that coming into 2025? And to what extent are you marketing this to retail like the online broker platforms?\nAdena Friedman: Okay. Great. Well, it has been a really nice grower for us. It's still a small contributor to revenue. So we love the growth, we love the momentum, but it's still a small contributor to the overall index. I mean, all overall options revenues. But we're hopeful that will become, obviously, more and more a big contributor to that business. In terms of retail, yes, we are actually -- the opportunities that we see for the index options are retail platforms, as you mentioned, and getting them into those major retail platforms. International investors also in really driving because we have a lot of demand for our data internationally. We see a lot of flow coming from international broker dealers and we see that as an opportunity to help them develop their strategies and their hedging and then also inclusion in ETFs as having the index options be an overlay on ETFs that we think could be a grower for us as well. So those are the areas that we're most focused on right now.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you very much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Great. Thank you. Well, as you heard this morning, Nasdaq continues to drive growth across our business. And as we continue to execute on our One Nasdaq strategy, we're confident that we'll drive additional growth and value for our clients, shareholders and employees. So thank you for joining and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll provide some perspective on the external environment, discuss our quarterly performance and review our progress against our strategic priorities. I will then hand the call over to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail. Beginning with the macroeconomic environment, internationally, major Central Banks have pivoted to lowering rates over the past several months to combat slowing economic growth. Notably, the European Central Bank has cut rates three times this year, which coupled with a solid labor market has helped the European economy stabilize in recent months. The US continues to show overall strength supported by the Fed's September rate cut and more recent services and labor data. Looking ahead, while the global macro environment remains fluid, which could lead to a range of potential outcomes, the US is currently trending toward a soft landing with additional rate cuts expected in the coming quarters. The current positive economic trends and outlook provide a constructive potential for sustained trading activity across our markets as well as a rebound in the global IPO environment in 2025. And as financial institutions continue to operate in a dynamic environment, we see consistent demand for our mission-critical technology. Against this economic backdrop, Nasdaq remains well positioned to deliver sustainable and durable growth across our diversified platforms. Now let me turn to our financial results. We delivered a strong quarter with 10% year-over-year growth in both net revenues and solutions revenue, marking our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions growth. Total annualized recurring revenue or ARR grew 8% to $2.7 billion. Expenses increased 5% in the quarter, reflecting investment in the business, partially offset by synergy achievement, while our operating margin increased to 54%. We continue to make progress on the successful integration of AxiomSL and Calypso, which has enabled us to action over 80% of our net expense synergies target and our strong free cash flow generation has allowed us to continue to delever, resulting in a 3.8 times leverage ratio in the quarter. Turning now to our business highlights, starting with Capital Access Platforms. The division delivered 2% ARR growth and 9% revenue growth fueled by another quarter of strong index performance. Beginning with data and listings, we continued to see modest growth in data revenue offset by a decline in listings revenue due to lower listings activity and prior year de-listings. In the quarter, we experienced a modest uptick in listings activity in the US. We welcomed 33 operating companies, contributing to a 75% win rate year-to-date through September of Nasdaq eligible operating company listings. Additionally, we have listed 5 of the top 10 largest IPOs in the first three quarters of the year, including the year's largest listing to date, Lineage. We also celebrated a major milestone as we recorded our 500th listing switch to Nasdaq from our primary listing competitor, cumulatively representing approximately $3 trillion of market value. This year alone, we've attracted 16 switches, including prominent government technology contractor, SAIC, and legendary food manufacturer, Campbell's, reinforcing Nasdaq's role as the premier venue for listings in the US. In data, we benefited from new enterprise license sales, higher demand from heightened market activity and continued strength in international markets. Across Workflow and Insights, we drove moderate growth with strength in analytics offset by Corporate Solutions. In Corporate Solutions, the broader operating environment, including sales cycles has not materially changed. We remain focused on client retention and product enhancements to ensure Nasdaq is well positioned when the IPO flywheel resumes, as evidenced by the previously announced introduction of new AI features across our suite of solutions. Within analytics, we've seen increased activity and demand for our data and workflow solutions with the asset owner and asset manager communities. Asset owners are using more manager research products and new tools such as the recently launched Peer Benchmarking Solution, while asset managers continue to seek unique insights through our data and services. And finally, our Index business delivered another exceptional quarter of growth with $62 billion in net inflows in the trailing 12 month period, including $14 billion in the third quarter, resulting in $575 billion in average AUM in the quarter. This reflects the broad strength of our Index franchise, while we continue to drive innovation and expansion with 35 new product launches this quarter. Turning next to Financial Technology. ARR growth across the division was 14%, including 24% in Financial Crime Management Technology, 15% in the combined AxiomSL and Calypso solutions and 11% in combined Market Technology and Trade Management Services. Overall, we signed 39 new clients, 110 upsells and 2 cross sells. Moving to the specific subdivisions. We're proud that Financial Crime Management Technology debuted as the number one provider for managed services and financial crime on Chartis Research's industry rankings, representing a strong recognition of our leadership across the Financial Crime Management industry. From an operational standpoint, we've seen strong client adoption in our integrated GenAI Entity Research Copilot rollout, which now is in the hands of over 2,000 US Institutions. We signed 28 new small and medium bank clients for a total of 109 new small to medium bank or SMB clients year-to-date. We continue to maintain a robust pipeline of SMB sales opportunities with a particular emphasis on targeting larger clients in the segment. During the quarter, we also signed one international Tier 1 client to our wire fraud solution as previously announced. We are making solid progress on our push for Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients and continue to have a growing pipeline in this key cohort. Moving to Regulatory Technology. AxiomSL was ranked number one by Chartis in regulatory reporting for markets and securities, in part due to our extensive coverage across jurisdictions, as well as our expertise in adapting to complex regulatory environments. During the quarter, we maintained momentum across AxiomSL and Surveillance with seven new clients and 70 upsells. AxiomSL delivered two significant upsells as it signed its first local banks in India and in the Philippines that can serve as reference clients as we build new relationships in these geographies. Surveillance delivered strong ACV bookings in the quarter with growth across exchanges and market participants and we continue to advance our Nasdaq Trade Surveillance cloud transition as 64% of clients are now cloud deployed and 11 percentage point increase since the beginning of this year. We also continue to see sustained momentum in Capital Markets Technology with a total of 4 new clients, 40 upsells and 1 cross sell. This was a strong quarter across our market structure provider client segment as Calypso signed its 20th Central Bank client and Market Technology signed 1 new cross sell and 13 upsells. More broadly, as financial institutions continue to expand coverage across the assets and geographies in which they trade, we see constructive environment for continued growth across our solutions. The Financial Technology division has a strong global presence. In this quarter, I would like to highlight our progress in Latin America. We continued to increase our footprint in the region through an enhanced partnership with Nubank, which is now using AxiomSL to support its regulatory reporting responsibilities in Colombia. We also signed a significant expansion of our technology partnership with Argentina's leading stock exchange group, BYMA, which is an existing CSD client and we signed them to modernize its clearing technology through a cloud delivery of our next-generation clearing solution. Across Latin America, Nasdaq serves 10 marketplaces as well as roughly 50 banking and payment services clients, comprising a broad range of digital and traditional banks, local and regional players as well as Tier 1 global banks. We're experiencing strong new client growth and over half of our Latin American clients that have adopted AxiomSL and Calypso have sought to expand their partnership with us in the last 12 months. Across the exchanges in the region, clients are seeking to modernize critical infrastructure to serve the evolving needs of global market participants as well as their domestic clients, many of which are digitizing their own operations. Latin America is just one of the many regional economies where we're helping financial institutions better navigate regulatory complexity and the modernization of market infrastructure and we look forward to our continued international expansion. Turning to Market Services, where we're generating Alpha in a higher Beta environment, Nasdaq delivered a record third quarter with 13% revenue growth. The growth was driven by higher volumes across US and European cash equities as well as record revenue for US multi-listed options and proprietary index options. In US equity derivatives, our multi-listed options market share continues to increase over the course of the year. Additionally, US index options continued its high growth delivering another record quarter with revenue doubling year-over-year. Turning to US cash equities. Nasdaq's overall equity market share was stable and on exchange market share increased, while capture remained healthy. And wrapping up with European cash equities, our market share remained steady as members increasingly favored quality and retail participation increased. I now want to provide an update on our strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Starting with integrate, as we near the one year anniversary of the completion of the Adenza acquisition, I'm extremely pleased with our progress-to-date. The integration continues seamlessly and we're delivering ahead of plan on net expense synergies and deleveraging. Operationally, our teams are unified and delivering for our clients as One Nasdaq. As a testament of the combined benefits of Nasdaq and Adenza for our clients, Nasdaq was recently ranked number five in Chartis' 2025 RiskTech100. This is an early validation of the thesis underpinning the acquisition, as Adenza and Nasdaq placed 10th and 18th respectively last year. Nasdaq is in the early innings of unleashing the power of our Financial Technology division and we look forward to building on this momentum. We continue to make strong progress advancing our innovate priority. We reached a major milestone during the quarter with the completion of the rollout of AI Copilot tools to 100% of our developers. We also launched an internal GenAI platform that features custom built skills designed to enhance productivity and efficiency. In less than two months, we've deployed roughly 400 unique skills with nearly 50% of our employees engaging with the platform. Nasdaq also launched new AI enabled products, headlined by the expansion of Nasdaq Verafin's Targeted Topology Analytics, which provides new detection capabilities for terrorist financing and drug trafficking activity. Following an extensive beta program, the terrorist financing analytic is expected to be released later this year. Earlier this month, Calypso also announced a new methodology to conduct investment portfolio risk calculations and produce predictive analytics using an AI-based machine learning capability. This technology allows financial institutions to improve the efficiency of conducting the most complex trading and regulatory risk calculations with up to 100 times faster processing speeds. Beyond AI, we continue to innovate by expanding our suite of new products and capabilities. This is particularly evident in our index franchise, which is a true innovation engine within Nasdaq and was recently recognized as the best index provider by structured retail products. Partnering with our clients, we brought 35 new investment products to market, including seven insurance annuity vehicles, aligned with our growth with our focus on international adoption and eight options overlay products, where we see strong sustained interest from investors. We also remain focused on international expansion with 57% of new products launched outside the United States. In Market Services, we successfully migrated Nasdaq ISE to our next generation derivatives platform called Fusion. Today, four of our six US options markets are now running on Fusion, resulting in lower latency, higher throughput and overall increased productivity. And concluding with our accelerate priority, we continue to make progress on our One Nasdaq strategy driving 2 cross sells across the Financial Technology division in the quarter. The percentage of cross sell opportunities in Financial Technologies pipeline is now above 10%, driven by strong client engagement and the cross sell campaigns launched to-date. The pipeline spans across regions, client segments and product lines and we expect to build on this in the coming quarters. We will launch additional cross sell campaigns in the fourth quarter and remain on track to exceed $100 million in cross sells by the end of 2027. To wrap up, the power of Nasdaq's diversified business model enabled us to deliver another strong quarter headlined by our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions growth. As we continue to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver on the Adenza acquisition thesis, Nasdaq has become a trusted partner to the world's financial system, poised to solve our clients' most complex challenges. We look forward to capitalizing on this momentum to deliver sustained profitable growth to our shareholders. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details. Great. Thanks, Owen. Yes, as we mentioned, the significant difference is really related to the professional services. As we move up market into the Tier 1s and Tier 2s, we're going to have more of an implementation element to those clients. And so there could be more revenue variability as we look at kind of both the timing of those implementations when they move from implementation to ARR and also the amount of implementation revenue that we might have in one quarter, one year versus the next. So in this particular quarter, we had two significant implementations well underway last year third quarter that drove up our professional services fees and now we've completed those implementations, moved them to ARR, but that also means that we're now in the mode of moving more of our clients into that implementation mode, but we just didn't have as much implementation revenue this quarter. So it's really going to have there is going to be some of that variability going forward as we continue to scale our upmarket business and that's something that we'll make sure that we provide disclosures on like we did today. In terms of our overall confidence in the business, we remain confident in our mid-20% medium term revenue outlook for financial crime management technology. We're very excited by the customer pipeline for the SMB space as well as demand for our solution among the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. And so with those, all of the opportunities ahead of us, we expect to continue strong growth over the medium term. And as we zoom in, as I mentioned, there are some revenue dynamics and moving up market that could create some variability, but we just feel that we're just extremely excited about everything that's happening in our business and continued momentum there. Thank you. Yes, great. Thanks, Craig. Yes, it is the same client and you are right that they're starting with payment fraud. And we are actively working with several of our Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients that we have sold to upsell them or to continue to expand our presence with them and they're doing active evaluations of additional modules that we have. And we have already upsold one of our Tier 2 clients, but we're actively working with them. I think they've been really, I have to say, I think their clients have been really happy with the results of the implementations and so that's obviously giving us nice tailwinds to discuss further enhancements or extensions of what they take from us. But of course those sales cycles are not instantaneous either. And so we're in the process of working with them to continue to show all the different strengths that we have, but it is a very, very active, an active conversation across several of our clients. Sure. Thanks. Yes, so far year-to-date we've had 7 cross sells, but that also does include Verafin sales to AxiomSL or Calypso clients, but across the Fintech division, 7 cross sells. And the campaigns are working well. Obviously it takes time for those campaigns to turn into sales, but we feel very good about what we've been able to see, in terms of bringing more Calypso capabilities to our market tech clients and vice versa, as well as bringing AxiomSL capabilities to our Calypso clients. And the two new campaigns that we're launching as we go through the rest of this year, one is we have a product called the Nasdaq Risk Platform, which is a real-time risk management platform for exchange traded products and we are cross selling that to Calypso clients. That actually we think is going to be very interesting because obviously as you know Calypso really focuses on our OTC instruments and then we have this great real-time risk management platform for exchange traded products. So it's a natural cross sell and we saw that as part of the deal. We knew that that was an opportunity and now we're launching a formal campaign around that. And then the third is, I mean, I'm sorry, the second one is AxiomSL global shareholder disclosures for global broker dealers. So there are new rules and requirements coming out on shareholder disclosures to the broker dealer community, which is both our market services clients and Calypso clients. And so we're definitely working on a campaign specifically on that. So those are the types of things that we're focused on as we expand our cross sell campaigns. Okay, great. Sure. So on timing of implementation, as you can imagine, as you go from the smaller banks that we serve to the larger banks we serve, the implementations become more complex and therefore, take more time. And so as we write this year, first of all, in the small to medium bank cohort, we have signed more of that medium bank size company. So we had, that's why, as Sarah mentioned that we had a 30% increase in the ACV for the clients we've sold this year in the SMB space because they've been more medium-sized clients. And those implementations do tend to take longer than a small client. And we would say anywhere from kind of 6 to 12 months for that medium client, really depends on the client and the complexity and also the completeness of what they're implementing day one. With the large clients, like the Tier 1 to Tier 2, it could be anywhere also from like 6 to 12 months, but more like 9 to 12 months for implementation so far at least. And that's when you first land in the client. If you're upselling and going to a second capability because we've already built a lot of the integrations with their data lakes internally and a lot of the systems that they have, it can go quicker, but still, you're dealing with a large institution. So you have a lot of program management and project management. And we don't have a lot of experience yet on upsell there. So we're hoping that, that could be a shorter time to implementation, but it still is going to be fairly long. And that's why professional services fees becomes more of an element of our revenue as you're dealing with the medium banks and the larger banks. And that dynamic is just that we had a year-over-year comp this year that had more professional services fees last year. And I think it's just a timing issue. I mean with regard to the IPO market, the IPO market. Well, it's been -- we're seeing some green shoots. We had 33 IPOs in the quarter really proud to have a 75% win rate year-to-date. We have a lot of companies that are in our pipeline. It's been very active actually in talking to those clients, pitching the great benefits of Nasdaq. And you can feel that there's just a lot of pent-up energy and demand to want to come to market. And I also think that with a better rate environment, so as we hopefully continue to see the Fed moderating the rates and to get it more in line with inflation today, that we will also have a good robust economic environment. But I think you should assume that we won't see a lot going into the rest of this year just because of other noise. And even into the first quarter, it's usually not a very active quarter anyway. I think there'll still be some transition there. So we're kind of aiming towards seeing more momentum in Q2 and beyond, and we're hopeful that it could be a much more active year next year. Sure. Yes, great. Well, we don't disclose specific campaigns kind of the opportunities there, but they all contribute to the overall growth expectations for solutions, I mean, I'm sorry, for Fintech and every new client counts. So as we said, we're very early in our journey there. I just want to point out that 2024, we've had a very significant integration. We brought the teams together. We brought the operations together. We're putting all the systems in place. We've actually had a lot of progress and getting all of the, what I'll call, sales tech, rev tech and client success type of tooling put in place. And so we're really -- this has been a building year. And yet, even in a building year, we're delivering really well across Fintech. I'm so proud of the team for that. And we also have 7 cross sells. So it's early, early. We have more than 10% of our pipeline today is cross sell opportunities. We have always said that there's -- this isn't going to be a linear path to at least the $100 million, we say exceeding $100 million. So it's not going to be a linear path. But we do expect that momentum will build over the next couple of years. As you know, sales cycles in these mission-critical technology solutions is not short. So you're talking anywhere. We've had a couple where we've had like a few months of -- from first conversation to signing, but most of the deals take like 9 to 12 months to get signed and started in terms of implementation. Sure. Okay. So the first thing is AxiomSL is global today. But you're right that there are certain geographies where AxiomSL is really, really strong and then there are certain geographies where I think Nasdaq is bringing them into geographies where we're strong. So the Philippines is one example where we are the provider of technology to the exchange there. We have good relationships with the financial community there and with the central regulators there. And so it gives us a great opportunity to go in and really engage the financial, the banks within that space to help them manage their regulatory needs. And the difference is like it could be that a bank, for instance, the bank in Philippines was an upsell. We said it was an upsell because they already may have used AxiomSL for international reporting, but they weren't using it for domestic reporting. So now we've connected with them for domestic reporting and the same with the bank in India, which is really exciting. They were using us for reporting their international regulatory requirements, but not using us for the domestic. And now we are working with them to make sure we can deliver the domestic reporting requirements. And that, of course, in India could open up a huge opportunity for us. So we see these as really great land and expand just in country where Nasdaq has a strong presence, but AxiomSL may not have had a stronger presence. Latin America actually has been an area where Calypso and AxiomSL have been strong. And we are over the last 10 years, we have really built up a great presence in Latin America. I think that it has been a really fun it's been a fun way for us to engage with our clients there. We now have over 10 market operators and we have about 50 bank and broker-dealer clients that use our technology. So that's been an area where we've already had a presence. But what's coming up when I mentioned on Colombia was it's actually a Brazilian bank, new bank, which is a great digital bank there. I don't know if they're expanding into Colombia or rather they just realize that they want to use us more advanced technology to support their Colombian regulatory requirements. But we see them as a great client to work with because they're so pan-Latin America. And it gives us a way to expand our presence there. So it's pretty exciting. We do not give an international growth rate just because everything we do is kind of global in Fintech, but we'll consider how we can provide you disclosures there. All right. Sure. Yes. Thanks. Well, just before we go into specific features, the way that we work with clients and pricing is kind of a little different product by product within Fintech, just based on the way we work with them. But in anti-financial crime or in the sorry financial crime management technology, we really generally have a three-year contract terms. And then upon renewal, we work with the bank to look at how much they've grown, how much they're using our service, how much value we're providing to them. And with regard to the entity research copilot, we are not explicitly charging for that. But as we work with them and to see, we have half the clients, by the way, are actually using it. So we rolled it out to 2,000 banks and we're seeing that half of the clients are engaging that capability. So, so far, it's really great, getting some fantastic feedback from the clients in terms of the efficiency gains that they're getting from that. So that would be part of the conversation on the renewal and the upsell that we get on renewal in terms of pricing. And then with regard to the broader Fintech platforms, those tend to be three to five years is kind of the average terms for a lot of our products in that space. And we do actually have CPI escalation capabilities year-over-year. And then upon renewal, again, we will look at are we delivering more value to them and do they see that as a value creator that we can charge more for in the next contract. So I do think we have good ways to engage them in multiple dimensions on pricing, but we aren't choosing to charge explicitly yet for a lot of the AI capabilities, we're just adding value into the product. With Corporate Solutions, it's a little different. We have actually launched a new module within IR Insight that is a paid module, let's call it, sustainability lens that allows companies to compare their sustainability disclosures to other peers. And so those are the types of things where we might charge explicitly for, but not in every way. So we're doing board summarization in our board portal tool and that's just an added feature that will not be explicitly charged for. But we see that as a way to enhance retention and also get new sales. So, sorry, it's a long answer, but that's how we kind of we approach it. Sure. Yes, sure. Well, first of all, so I think it's important to note that we've given a fair amount of disclosure that we had that one client where we were doing -- we had really gotten to, I would say, a peak level of implementation with them last year in 2023 in terms of resources against that project. And that resulted in $27 million of professional services fees last year. That year-over-year comparison kind of starts to abate in the fourth quarter of this year, meaning, we won't have a tough year-over-year comp in that regard starting in the fourth quarter. And also, as you pointed out, we've had a lot of sales this year. So we've had a couple of new clients, but also just in the quarter, 13 upsell. So actually, we do have really great momentum there. And it's exciting to see as clients are really focused on modernizing their markets. They're really starting to understand why a cloud delivered or at least a cloud-ready solution is going to be important to their future. That's been a drumbeat that we've been discussing with them now for a few years. So it's really exciting to see that it's starting to turn into contracts and sales. The strongest uptake we've seen in our next-gen products have been in our clearing solution and our trading solution. And then also, we've had a lot of exchanges finally realize that their CSDs are decades old, and they're working with us to upgrade their settlement solutions as well. So it's been a good year. But as you said, it's a tough comp, that $27 million, that converted into $11 million of ARR as we got through the, I think it's right in the beginning of the third quarter. And we also feel like we've got good momentum going into next year that we think should be able to show you that we can get back to a growth certainly in the professional services and hopefully better growth throughout the whole business. Sure. Well, I think what we've said so far is, number one, we have -- we give you both kind of a medium-term outlook on ARR and overall revenue growth for the Adenza businesses kind of mid-teens ARR growth, low to mid-teens revenue growth. Everything we're seeing is consistent with that so far in terms of kind of how we've been progressing with the business and certainly how we've been delivering and the momentum we see is strong and active and healthy and consistent. So I think that's as far as we can say right now. But certainly as we've been looking at the business and evaluating its performance within Nasdaq, we feel like it's consistent with where we see the medium-term outlook. Yes. Sure. So well, first of all, I'm going to see how, I would just say demand in general is strong and active. Whether or not it's a bigger upgrade cycle for AxiomSL next year? I'm kind of thinking about that. I think it's more kind of Q4 like kind of coming into Q4 of this year. And you are right. We've had really good sales this year. So that should accrue to the benefit of professional services fees as we go through next year because we had a decline in professional services fees this year versus last year. We do see the opportunity for that to recover as we've had a strong sales year in AxiomSL. In general, though, I just want to point out, just remind everyone, as we've moved to ratable within AxiomSL, the ARR and subscription revenue should be relatively consistent with each other, not always. There are some differences and Sarah did a nice job walking through that on the teach-in a month ago, if you want to listen to that. The thing that can create revenue variability are the professional services fees that we've mentioned. And so as we look at how we've progressed through the year of sales and upsells, as you're talking about kind of renewing contracts, those things can be beneficial to us, and we see that as an opportunity for next year to have a better professional services year-over-year versus this year. I think that with Calypso, just to remind you, half of the contract value is recognized upfront when we renew a client or sign a new client. So that creates more variability quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year in revenue. But that's why we tend to really focus on ARR there, because that gives you the consistency of how we're doing and just driving demand and delivering. And again, that also can have year-over-year differences in implementations. But right now, you're seeing really strong sales there, really good momentum, and we're really comfortable with how that business is progressing. Sure. Sure. Yes, I'll answer the SEC Tick Rule and I'll hand it over to Sarah. So the tick size rule has been an interesting process with the SEC and we see the rule as having some benefits and then some concerns. Now in terms from a financial performance perspective, we do not anticipate that the rule will have any material impact on our revenues in our Market Services business. But when we evaluate a role like that, we really focus on two key parameters. One is just how does it improve the markets for investors and making sure that it really is something that will improve the experience that investors have. And then as part of that, how does it tighten the national best bid offer? So how does it make it so that the lit markets have a better ability to reflect supply and demand in the national best bid offer. And so if we unpack the contents of the rule, there are three things. One is the tick sizes. So they're narrowing the tick size to $0.005 from $0.01 for the smaller stocks in our market and we think that's good. That's good for market price discovery. I think that's good for the market. We call them tick constrained stocks where the lit markets, the exchanges have not been able to really reflect proper supply and demand in these smaller companies. And so that's a benefit to markets. The second component is just having odd lots be subject to price protection, which is small, but we think that's a positive also for markets. But the one area that we're really focused on, and we've been very consistent in our comments to the SEC is on the access fees. We had been suggesting and recommending that they look at proportionate changes to access fees. So for those stocks that have a penny tick regime, they should maintain the access fees. And then those that come down to $0.005 should have a change in the access fees commensurate. But what they ultimately did was take down all access fees by two-thirds. And that makes it so it's much harder for markets to incentivize lit orders. And so if we are not able to incentivize the market makers to put their capital into the lit markets, it will widen spreads, it could spin out the book. And that we see as bad for investors. And so we are definitely focused on that. The way, as you know, we have kind of access fees and rebates, it's not going to have a significant impact on us. It's really going to have a significant impact on investors. So we want to make sure that we are assessing that and evaluating that to determine what kind of next steps we're going to take there. Sure. Yes. That's a very specific situation. So that's a long-standing client of very clients that we're actively engaged with. They've actually recently taken an upsell in Calypso. So we know that they are very pleased with the platform, but it really had to do with how they wanted to structure the timing against their renewal date and they've just decided to make that decision a little bit closer to their renewal date as opposed to doing it in advance, well in advance of their renewal date. So there's nothing to read into that situation. It's very specific. But because of the fact that half the revenue is recognized upfront on these license fees, it does have an impact just on the quarter and we just wanted to make sure we were very disclosive about that to help you understand kind of how to evaluate Calypso's revenue this quarter. But nothing to read into it. In general, the renewal environment is strong. We provide mission-critical technologies here. We have very high retention rates across our Fintech solutions and it's really just a matter of working with the clients and being responsive to them and their needs as they think about their renewal dates. Sure. Okay. Great. Well, it has been a really nice grower for us. It's still a small contributor to revenue. So we love the growth, we love the momentum, but it's still a small contributor to the overall index. I mean, all overall options revenues. But we're hopeful that will become, obviously, more and more a big contributor to that business. In terms of retail, yes, we are actually -- the opportunities that we see for the index options are retail platforms, as you mentioned, and getting them into those major retail platforms. International investors also in really driving because we have a lot of demand for our data internationally. We see a lot of flow coming from international broker dealers and we see that as an opportunity to help them develop their strategies and their hedging and then also inclusion in ETFs as having the index options be an overlay on ETFs that we think could be a grower for us as well. So those are the areas that we're most focused on right now. Sure. Great. Thank you. Well, as you heard this morning, Nasdaq continues to drive growth across our business. And as we continue to execute on our One Nasdaq strategy, we're confident that we'll drive additional growth and value for our clients, shareholders and employees. So thank you for joining and have a great day."

            "name": "Sarah Youngwood",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena, and good morning, everyone. We're proud to share our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit solutions revenue growth and we are also making excellent progress in integrating AxiomSL and CALYPSO. Notably, we have actioned over 80% of net expense synergies to-date. Deleveraging continues and is now down to 3.8 times and we're seeing strong traction with clients with over 10% of our fintech pipeline coming from cross sells. Let's turn to our third quarter results on slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion up 10% with solutions revenue of $904 million also up 10%. Operating expense was $543 million up 5%, resulting in an operating margin of 54% and an EBITDA margin of 56%, each up two percentage points. Overall, this resulted in net income of $429 million and diluted EPS of $0.74. Slide 11 shows the drivers of our 10% net revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 7.5 percentage points of Alpha growth on a net basis, driven by new and existing clients, product innovation as well as market share and capture. Overall, Beta factors contributed 2.5 percentage points of growth this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indexes and higher overall volumes in Market Services, offset primarily by delisting and downgrade. As shown on slide 12, we had ARR growth of 8%, with SaaS revenue growth of 17%. Notably, SaaS as a percent of ARR increased three percentage points to 37%. Let's review division results for the quarter starting on slide 13. In Capital Access Platform, we delivered revenue of $501 million up 9%. Data and Listings revenue was up 1% with flat ARR. Revenue from higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing was partially offset by the impact of delisting, downgrades and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the quarterly impact from initial listing fees to be about $3 million for the next three quarters. Delisting trends are improving and we have seen roughly 20% fewer delistings year-to-date through the third quarter versus the prior year period, suggesting that delisting should be less of a revenue headwind in 2025. Index revenue was up 26% in the third quarter, driven by $62 billion of organic net inflows in the last 12 months, including $14 billion in the quarter, as well as market performance, resulting in record average ETP AUM of $575 billion with features and options volume also up 24%. In Workflow and Insights, revenue was up 3% with ARR growth of 5%. The increase was driven by continued growth in innovative analytics products, mainly eVestment and Data Link, with particular strength for eVestment in the Asset Owner and Consultant client segments. This was partially offset by a continuation of the environment we have previously described in Corporate Solutions. Analytics had a strong quarter with revenue and ARR growth in the high-single-digits. Operating margin for Capital Access Platforms was 58%, up two percentage points. Looking ahead, our expectation for full year Capital Access Platforms revenue growth remains unchanged. We expect to exceed our medium term growth outlook range with Index expected to come in above its range, Data and Listing essentially flat year-on-year and Workflow and Insights expected to come in below its range. Moving to Financial Technology on slide 14. Total division revenue of $403 million was up 10% with ARR growth of 14%. The difference between revenue growth and ARR growth for Fintech and its subdivision is primarily driven by a decline in professional services fees, including a large 2023 market infrastructure client delivery and capital markets tech that converted to ARR and the timing of bookings and upgrades as well as the proportion of cloud bookings in RegTech. We had double-digit ARR growth across all subdivisions, which benefited from 39 new clients, 110 upsells and 2 cross sells in the quarter. Financial Crime Management Technology revenue increased 20% with ARR growth of 24%, reflecting solid revenue growth against a tough comp of 29% in 3Q 2023, a quarter that included higher professional services fees. This quarter, we saw a revenue mix shift from professional services fees to ARR due to successful on-time implementation from Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients. Additionally, we had minor changes in the timing of other client deliveries. Clients are actively showing they appreciate the value of our products, including new enhancements such as the GenAI Entity Research Copilot. This was evidenced by net revenue retention of 114%, driven by pricing, minimum churn, upsell and renewals. We are also making excellent progress with larger clients within the SMB cohort. New client signings this year have resulted in 30% higher annual contract value per SMB client year-to-date compared to the same period last year. Capital Market Technology delivered 8% revenue growth and ARR growth of 12% with four new clients for the upsells and 1 cross sell in the quarter. Calypso was up 14% and had ARR up 16%, including three new clients and 27 upsells. Notable deals in the quarter included Calypso signing its 20th Central Bank client and significant upsells in Asia. While there will always be timing impact with specific deals creating variation in revenue growth rates, demand for Calypso enhanced ARR remains strong with good retention rates, continuing momentum in our sales pipeline and consistent execution in our sales cycle. Together, Trade Management Services and Market Technology had 1 new client, 13 upsells and 1 cross sell. Combined ARR was up 11%, primarily reflecting the benefit of upsells and pricing. This included a record 14% ARR growth in Market Tech, which includes the conversion of the $11 million from a large implementation we mentioned last quarter into subscription revenue. That said, combined revenue grew 5% due to professional services fees in the prior year period. As we mentioned last quarter in Market Tech, the market infrastructure clients that contributed the $11 million of ARR this quarter had $27 million of professional services fees in the full year of 2023. This year over-year-headwind will abate in Q4 of this year. Additionally, with seven clients deliveries signed to-date and a strong sales pipeline for the rest of the year, we anticipate a solid recovery in professional services revenue in 2025. Regulatory Technology revenue increased 8% and ARR grew 11% with 7 new client wins and 70 upsells in the quarter. AxiomSL revenue grew 10% with 15% growth in ARR. The strong underlying performance including 1 new client win and 20 upsells. Surveillance grew revenue and ARR by 6% with 6 new clients and 50 upsells. Fintech operating margin was 44%, a one percentage point increase, reflecting both operating leverage and the benefit from realized synergies. Looking ahead at our 2024 growth expectation for Fintech. As we just discussed, we have strong fundamentals and ARR growth, which we expect to continue for the rest of the year. As a reminder, we maintain our expectation for combined AxiomSL and Calypso ARR growth in 2024 to come in within its medium term outlook range. For Financial Crime Management Technology, given revenue growth rates of 23% for the first half and 20% in Q3, we may end up a bit below 23% for the full year. That said, the fundamentals of the business, our competitive position and demand for our products continue to be excellent. We maintain our expectation for regulatory technology to come in towards the low end of our medium-term growth outlook. And for Capital Markets Technology, we expect full year growth to come in towards the low end of our medium-term growth outlook due to a shift in the expected timing of a Calypso renewal from the fourth quarter of 2024 to the first half of 2025. Wrapping the division with the strong performance of Market Services, which had net revenue of $266 million up 13%. Revenue growth benefited from record US derivatives revenue as a result of higher volume and capture in US options and index options as well as higher volume and capture in US and European cash equities, partially offset by a year-on-year decline in US option market share and lower European derivatives capture. Of note, US tape plan revenue increased $4 million sequentially with $3 million reflecting cumulative audit and other one-time benefits. North America was a primary contributor to our site performance with growth contribution, including index option, option capture, equity capture and share and take market share. US equity market share was also up sequentially at above 30%. Market Services operating margin was 61%, a three percentage point increase. Moving to expense on slide 16. We had non-GAAP expense of $543 million up 5%, resulting in operating margin and EBITDA margin expansion of two percentage points each. We are tightening our non-GAAP expense guidance for the year from $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion to $2.150 billion to $2.180 billion. We have actioned more than 80% of our net expense synergies through the third quarter. The synergies we have actioned so far have resulted in a two percentage point reduction in our expense growth so far this year and we expect the two percentage points to remain for the full year. Our non-GAAP tax rate decreased due to the integration of recent acquisitions as well as energy tax credit obtained under the Inflation Reduction Act. As a result, our non-GAAP tax rate of 21.3% in the quarter including the year-to-date capture. We now expect the 2024 non-GAAP tax rate that is one to two percentage point lower than prior expectations at 23.5% to 24.5% versus 24.5% to 26.5% previously. Under the current tax regime, we expect tax rates to remain generally in line with 2024 and future years. Turning to capital allocation on slide 17. Nasdaq generated free cash flow of approximately $300 million in the third quarter. Gross leverage decreased to 3.8 times from 3.9 times last quarter due to EBITDA growth and debt pay down. We paid a dividend per share of $0.24 or $138 million representing a 35% annualized payout ratio. We repurchased 1.4 million shares for $88 million to opportunistically take advantage of the attractiveness of our stock, primarily alongside the Thoma Bravo secondary execution. This allowed us to complete our program to offset the 2024 employee related dilution. We will continue to focus on deleveraging in the fourth quarter. As we approach the one year anniversary of the close of the Adenza acquisition, I am proud of our results and impressed by the team's performance in advancing the integration and powering Nasdaq's evolution into a Fintech powerhouse. We are ideally positioned to execute on our next phase of sustainable growth. With that, turning it to Q&A. So in terms of the expenses piece, first of all, we did tighten it. So we're now at the range around the same midpoint on. And if you look at what could make it go lower versus higher, first of all, you have the revenue-related investments and there is always some variability that can happen in the fourth quarter, and it's a very important quarter in terms of like revenue. The next piece could be the timing of marketing and the margin, the timing of investments."

After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAto Garrett: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results. On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. The press release and earnings presentation accompanying this call can be found on our Investor Relations website. I would like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements on this call that involve risks. A summary of these risks is contained in our press release and a more complete description in our annual report on Form 10-K. Also, please note that we will discuss our financial results on a pro forma basis and with year-on-year growth rates, which means that we are showing results versus the prior year period as if we owned Calypso and AxiomSL for all of 2023 and excluding the impact of FX. References to organic growth exclude the impact of FX, acquisitions and divestitures. Reconciliations of US GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. I will now turn the call over to Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll provide some perspective on the external environment, discuss our strong quarterly performance highlights as well as our progress against our strategic priorities, and then I'll hand the call to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail. Turning to the economy in the US, we're continuing to see solid, but slowing GDP growth, along with cooling inflation and slightly rising unemployment. These data points support the potential for easing monetary policy in the coming months as the Fed continues to strive for an economic soft landing. The general stability in the US economy and the potential for a lower cost of capital going forward is resulting in modest improvements in the IPO landscape as we progress through 2024, including solid activity this week. However, investors continue to contend with external uncertainties and the timing of monetary policy shifts as well as our dynamic macro political environment. As a result, we continue to expect modestly improving IPO activity for the remainder of 2024, and our current US IPO pipeline indicates that stronger momentum is likely to manifest starting in the first half of 2025. We're also seeing stronger economic underpinnings in Europe, aided by the ECB's easing monetary policy, including improving economic prospects in the Nordics. The improvement is not yet translating into a material increase in new public issuances, but our European IPO pipeline is healthy and growing, particularly for 2025. As investors and industry participants navigate the dynamic market environment, we continue to see sustained robust trading activity in the markets as well as strong demand for mission-critical technology solutions from financial institutions globally. As a result, our markets continue to experience strong volumes, and client demand for our FinTech solutions remains consistent with trends we have seen through the cycle, which provides a healthy backdrop for continued revenue growth across our solutions suite. Now let me turn to our financial results, which demonstrate the power and resilience of our diversified business model and our ability to succeed through economic cycles. We delivered a strong quarter with $1.2 billion in net revenues, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with solutions revenues at 13% growth. Our overall annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 7% to $2.7 billion. I'm particularly pleased with the strength of the performance across our business, which is a testament to the power of our platform. We're integrating the Adenza acquisition ahead of schedule and are realizing the investment thesis that underpin the transaction as we demonstrate its value for clients, shareholders and employees. Our expenses for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, within our guidance. Our operating income grew approximately 14%. And importantly, our operating margin increased to 53%, representing over one percentage point of operating leverage while we continue to invest to support growth in our business and deliver on synergies. Turning now to a discussion of the business highlights, starting with capital access platforms. While ARR growth in the division remained at 1%, our index revenue grew 29%, resulting in overall revenue growth for capital access platforms of 10%. In Listings, we welcomed 31 operating company IPOs maintaining our strong win rate of 72% based on Nasdaq eligible listings. While the slower IPO environment remains a headwind, we're encouraged by signs of improvement, as supported by our most recent IPO Pulse Index, which is near a three-year high. Overall growth in data and listings continue to experience challenges as modest growth in market data and the slowly improving IPO environment were offset by the impact of prior year delistings. Growth in our analytics business benefited from continued demand across the investment community for actionable intelligence and increased efficiency. However, that growth was partially offset by continued headwinds in corporate solutions, resulting in more muted growth for workflow and insights. Our index business delivered another exceptional quarter with $17 billion of net inflows during the quarter, totaling $53 billion over the last 12 months. We also achieved another record in Index ETP AUM exiting the quarter at $569 billion. Turning next to Financial Technology. ARR growth across the division was 13%, including 25% in Financial Crime Management Technology, 14% in the combined AxiomSL and Calypso solutions and 9% in the combined Market Technology and Trade Management Services. The division had 69 new client signings, 96 upsells and 4 cross-sells. We also saw continued cloud adoption as 68% of AxiomSL and Calypso 's combined bookings in the quarter were cloud-based with a strong pipeline for future quarters. Turning to the specific subdivisions. Financial Crime Management Technology continued its strong momentum. We signed over 50 new clients in the SMB space, and we continue to make progress in the Upmarket segment focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. In July, we signed a new international Tier 1 bank, which is also an exciting cross-sell. Going forward, we continue to maintain a strong sales pipeline within the core SMB segment, and we have a growing pipeline of new clients and upsells among Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. Across Regulatory Technology, we see sustained demand across both existing and new clients as financial institutions face increasingly dynamic regulatory environment, including changes in regulation globally related to asset thresholds. Among the many regulatory trends that are driving sales demand, we're pleased with our progress in signing clients around the world as they focus on implementing Basel IV and preparing to implement Basel III end game. In Capital Markets Technology, we continue to see strong demand for mission-critical technology as many of our clients focused on modernizing their infrastructure to enhance resilience and performance. For Calypso, we see robust new demand, especially in the Treasury segment in addition to cloud transformation of large-scale clients. In our Market Services division, we delivered revenue growth of 3%. We experienced healthy volumes across North America and Europe, and we achieved a sequential increase in North American options market share as well as growth in Nasdaq US equities on-exchange market share and capture. Our US index options achieved record revenues, more than doubling versus last year, due to higher capture and volumes. In our US Cash Equities business, we executed successful Russell, MSCI and S&P rebalances during the quarter, which showcased the strength and resiliency of our markets. During the Russell event, for instance, nearly 2.9 billion shares, representing a record notional value of over $95 billion, were executed in the Closing Cross, representing the largest liquidity event on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange or the Russell Reconstitution. In our European markets, the strength of our market ecosystem, as evidenced by the depth of book, breadth of participants and product innovation continues to drive market share gains. Overall, we're pleased to report a solid quarter of market services and remain focused on retaining our leading position across all of our markets. I now want to spend a few minutes updating you on how we're executing against our 2024 strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Starting with integrate, we have actioned over 70% of the $80 million of net expense synergies, and our leverage ratio reached 3.9 times at quarter-end, both ahead of plan. Both AxiomSL and Calypso are fully integrated into the Financial Technology division and we've established strong leadership, a well-structured operating model and a One Nasdaq go-to-market approach to ensure we're delivering for our clients with the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness. Our CRM's integration for the Calypso and Axiom solutions is now completed ahead of schedule, and this supports divisional sales coordination as well as the sales incentive program established at the beginning of the year. Importantly, across AxiomSL, Calypso and Verafin, we've been highly focused on cultural integration into the broader Nasdaq enterprise. And internal surveys continue to show that our employees are highly engaged and energized to deliver for our clients. We're also making strong progress advancing our innovate priority. We currently have approximately 50% of our employee base working with AI tools focused on enhancing productivity as well as driving our product road map. By the end of Q3, 100% of our developers will have access to AI copilot tools and we recently had over 650 employees participate in several AI hackathons across Nasdaq. During the quarter, we continued to introduce new AI capabilities within our client-facing solutions. Consistent with other Gen AI capabilities recently launched in our Verafin and Boardvantage solutions, with an investment, we have deployed a new AI-powered feature for the Market Lens module called Pension Meeting Minute Summarization. The feature provides asset managers with key insights on current and future pension fund strategies to help inform their business development and engagement priorities with top pension decision makers. We also have a strong pipeline of AI features scheduled to launch in the coming quarters, including in Market Surveillance and IR Insight. And we're seeing strong early traction in client adoption and effectiveness related to the capabilities that are already in market. Specifically, Dynamic M-ELO, the first SEC approved AI order type, which we launched in April, is driving a 20% increase in both volumes for this order type and improvement in fill rates compared to the prior static version. Verafin's integrated Gen AI feature, Entity Research Copilot, is now deployed at more than 250 clients and we expect to complete our rollout in the third quarter. Client feedback has been positive, demonstrating that the integrated copilot functionality with the integrated copilot functionality, Verafin solutions can reduce alert research time by up to 90% compared to banks that do not use Verafin. Beyond AI, we continue to drive innovation towards key growth priorities. For example, in our Index business, innovation is at the heart of our growth strategy as we extend the franchise to new markets globally, drive institutional adoption and introduce new products beyond the NASDAQ 100. During the quarter, 50% of index product launches were outside of the United States. And we're quickly gaining traction in investor adoption. In total, we launched 18 new products with our partners, including 12 ETPs and three insurance annuity vehicles geared towards our institutional clients. Additionally, we're pleased that our AI-themed ETP saw more than $1 billion of inflows over the last 12 months. Wrapping up with our Accelerate priority. The addition of AxiomSL and Calypso has significantly elevated the dialogue we have with our clients as a strategic partner. There's no better evidence of that than the early traction we're seeing in our cross-sell efforts. Since closing the transaction, we have executed on 11 FinTech cross-sells. We had four this quarter, including two cross-sells of our AxiomSL solution, two Calypso clients. This is a great start, but it's only the beginning on our journey to exceed $100 million in cross-sells by the end of 2027. Just eight months since the acquisition closed, 10% of the opportunities in our pipeline are cross-sells, and we expect this to grow sequentially. The division has several strategic cross-sell campaigns underway, which are generating strong top-of-funnel interest and underpins our continued confidence in our ability to grow cross-sell bookings over the coming years. To wrap up, we're pleased to deliver a quarter of strong results, driven by continued momentum in solutions and the power of our diversified platform to drive scalable, profitable and durable growth. Importantly, we're delivering on the Adenza acquisition thesis as our clients increasingly see Nasdaq as a strategic partner that can help solve their largest, most complex challenges. We look forward to leveraging this momentum to unlock our next phase of growth. And with that I'll now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details.\nSarah Youngwood: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we made excellent progress in both the integration of Adenza and the accelerated paydown of debt. We actioned over 70% of net expense synergies six months ahead of schedule. We have also come in ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plans ending the quarter of 3.9 leverage. Turning to our second quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion, up 10%, with solutions revenue up 13%. Operating expense was $539 million, up 7% within our guidance with an operating margin of 53% and an EBITDA margin of 56%. Overall, this resulted in net income of $397 million and diluted EPS of $0.69. Slide 11 shows the drivers of our 10% pro forma revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 8% outside growth on a net basis, driven by new and existing clients as well as our focus on product innovation. Overall, beta factors were 2% this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indexes as well as higher overall volumes in market services. On Slide 12, we had 7% ARR growth. And as part of that, we had 17% SaaS revenue growth, resulting in SaaS as a percent of ARR now at 37%, up four percentage points. Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In capital assets platforms, we delivered revenue of $481 million, reflecting growth of 10%. We had another exceptional quarter for our Index business with revenue up 29%, driven by $53 billion of organic inflows in the last 12 months, including $17 billion this quarter, and market performance, both resulting in average ETP AUM of $531 billion. In addition, future volumes were up 25%. Data and Listings revenue was up 1%, while ARR was down 1%. The difference was driven by small one-time revenue benefits primarily related to listings. Revenue from higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing offset the impact of delisting, downgrades and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. We expect the quarterly headwind from lower amortization of prior period listing fees to increase from an immaterial impact in 1Q '24 and approximately $1 million in 2Q '24 to about $3 million in each of the next four quarters. However, we have seen roughly 25% fewer delistings in the first half of the year versus the prior year period, suggesting that delistings should be less of a revenue headwind in 2025. Lastly, Workflow and Insights revenue was up 4%, in line with ARR growth of 4%. This was driven by continued growth in innovative analytics products, mainly Datalink and eVestment. This was partially offset by continued headwinds in Corporate Solutions. Analytics had a strong quarter with both revenue and ARR in high-single-digits. Operating margin was 56%, up one percentage point. Looking forward, we expect full year revenue growth for capital access platforms to exceed our medium-term growth outlook range with index expected to come in above its range. Workflow and Insights expected to come in below its range and with Data and Listings essentially flat year-on-year. Moving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. We had another quarter of strong growth with division revenue of $420 million, a 16% increase and with ARR growth of 13%. This performance reflects double-digit revenue and ARR growth across our three subdivisions. Financial Client Management Technology delivered 24% revenue growth and 25% ARR growth with 53 new clients in the quarter. Capital Markets Technology had revenue growth of 14% and ARR growth of 11%, on the back of seven new clients and 38 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by the timing of on-prem renewals and professional services fees. Together, Trade Management Services and Market Tech grew revenues 2%. We experienced strong subscription revenue and ARR growth, up 9% for both businesses and up three percentage points sequentially. The lower growth in revenue was due to year-over-year decline in Professional Services revenues. As we mentioned last quarter, in Market Tech, we had a very large implementation in 2023, which created a $27 million revenue benefit in the full year of 2023. And this year has resulted in subscription revenue or ARR of $11 million. We expect this year-over-year headwind to persist in Q3 and abate in Q4. Calypso had revenue growth of 34% and ARR growth of 13%. Revenue was higher than the expectation we provided in the first quarter call due to broad strength in sales activity, including a strategic early renewal, 29 upsells and five new clients. As we look forward, we continue to see solid momentum in the business and expect Capital Markets Technology revenue growth for 2024 to remain in line with our medium-term outlook. Overall, for the second half of 2024, we expect more normalized growth across the products within the division versus the first half of the year with consistent growth across quarters. Regulatory Technology had revenue growth of 16% and ARR growth of 10%, with seven new clients and 58 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by AxiomSL, which had 23% revenue growth and 14% ARR growth. The 23% revenue growth was primarily due to strong subscription revenue, including a large on-prem renewal, 29 upsells and one new client in the quarter, partially offset by a decline in professional services fees due to the timing of client deliveries. The FinTech operating margin was 47% in the second quarter, up three percentage points, including the benefit of synergy realization. As we finalize the business combination accounting for Adenza during the measurement period, let me update you on a change we are evaluating on AxiomSL. As part of this potential accounting change, we would recognize on-prem subscription-based revenue on a ratable basis over the contract term, whereas we currently recognize approximately 50% upfront. This is due to the frequency of critical mandatory regulatory updates that we implement and embed in the AxiomSL software throughout the contract term. We believe this change would enhance our financial reporting and would not change the Adenza medium-term outlook we had provided nor our ability to achieve it this year. If an adjustment is made, it would not have a material impact on Nasdaq overall, and 2Q would remain a strong quarter with FinTech revenue growth near the top of its medium-term outlook range, solutions revenue growth at the high end of its medium-term outlook range and AxiomSL and Calypso combined revenue growth above 20%. Importantly, combined ARR growth of 14% and net revenue retention of 111% would be unchanged. Specifically at the AxiomSL level, we expect subscription revenue growth to be more consistent going forward and remain in line with our medium-term outlook. AxiomSL's 2Q '24 subscription revenue growth would have been generally in line with ARR. However, the timing-related decline in professional services fees I mentioned earlier would have driven total AxiomSL revenue growth for the quarter to the low to mid-single digits. We expect to receive additional information to finalize our analysis in 3Q. And if we make the change, we will provide updated historical information by quarter for 2023 and the first half of 2024, during 3Q and ahead of reporting our 3Q earnings. Now wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $250 million for the quarter, up 3%. Growth was driven by higher volumes in cash equities in both North America and Europe as well as in US options, increased capture in North America equities, US index options high growth, share gains in European equities from a very strong base and one additional trading day. This was partially offset by lower share in US options and equities, though share for options was stronger sequentially and increased over the course of the quarter. We also had lower US state revenue. Market Services second quarter operating margin was 58%, a one percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to continued investments in market monetization and regulatory obligations. Moving on to non-GAAP operating expense on Slide 16. This quarter was $539 million, reflecting pro forma growth of 7% or $15 million sequentially. This is within the guidance we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And as a reminder, second quarter included the impact of annual merit adjustments and equity grants. All-in, we generated positive operating leverage with an increase in both operating and EBITDA margin of over one percentage point. This included the benefit of synergies this quarter and the funding of additional revenue-related expense. We originally targeted $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 2025. As of Q2, we have already actioned over 70% of that amount, six months ahead of schedule. The P&L benefit of the actions already taken represent approximately one percentage point reduction in expense growth in the first half of this year. Please note that the actions of 2Q and 3Q have a longer time line to expense recognition. And as such, we expect the full impact of synergies to moderate expense growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points for 2024. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating expense of $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion, reflecting an increase to the bottom end of the range to account for strong revenue generation, which increases variable compensation and enables us to invest in growth initiatives while also accounting for the synergy benefits realized in the year. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to our capital allocation on Slide 17. Nasdaq continued its track record of strong free cash flow generation with $328 million in the second quarter, representing a conversion ratio of approximately 100% over the trailing 12 months. This takes into consideration specific onetime costs associated with the Adenza acquisition and integration. This quarter, we continued to prioritize debt reduction and are ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plan. We paid down net $174 million of commercial paper and ended the quarter at 3.9 times gross leverage versus 4.1 times last quarter. This was achieved while also increasing our quarterly dividend 9% to $0.24 per share or $138 million, reflecting a 37% annualized payout ratio, and repurchasing approximately $60 million of our shares to opportunistically take advantage of the attractiveness of our stock and start to offset 2024 employee dilution. Looking ahead, we remain focused on deleveraging and expect to pay down the remaining commercial paper balance near term while remaining opportunistic and flexible. We also remain committed to offsetting employee dilution. In closing, we are thrilled with the pace at which we are delivering and the results of our integration. We are executing on our plans with focus and discipline, building a financial technology powerhouse, driving durable growth and profitability for our shareholders. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you. So within Financial Crime Management, you highlighted price increases as a contributor to growth. I was hoping you could talk about pricing more generally across your businesses and specifically what maybe price contributed to the strong growth in the quarter across the various segments.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I would just say that as we've talked about in the past, price increases are different per product and kind of different from -- in terms of how we structure contracts with our clients within FinTech. So we don't provide you a very specific answer to that question. But I think that if we think about what we've said at least for the AxiomSL and Calypso products in the past is that about half of the revenue increase that we see in any given quarter comes from upgrades and upsells of our clients and the other half comes from new sales and price increases, the price changes we make within the contracts. Some of our contracts have CPI increases and somewhere -- what we would do is we would upsell our clients or increase price upon contract renewal. So that would mean that we would have a constant price for a period of time and then increased price on contract renewal. We do that on the basis of increased value to the clients or the fact that the clients themselves are growing and, therefore, they're getting more value out of the product. So that's -- it kind of depends on the product, Dan.\nDaniel Fannon: Understood. And you mentioned that 10% of the pipeline is made up of cross-sell opportunities. I guess in a lot of upsells and momentum is known, as you highlighted in the business, across a lot of the businesses. I was hoping you could talk about kind of the use cases you're seeing early within the cross-sell and maybe how those -- that dialogue is progressing from what you're having such day and where you see that momentum in terms of the actual products.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, within the quarter, as I mentioned, we had four cross-sells, and two of them were selling AxiomSL to Calypso clients. And so that really comes from the fact that we have a really strong relationship with our clients. In Calypso, they have new regulatory obligations that they're having to become ready for and they've chosen to work with us. And one of the benefits we have is that we can actually -- we have a data API connector between those two products. So we can take data directly out of the Calypso platform and feed it into AxiomSL and make it much easier to implement the AxiomSL solution for those regulatory obligations. So that is definitely helping to drive demand. We also -- in terms of our cross-sell campaigns, we have one cross-sell campaign that's really focused on our exchange clients where we have clients -- where we provide clearing technology and Calypso has amazing collateral management capabilities. And so we are working with them to show the benefits of adding the Calypso collateral management into their clearing operations. I mean, then we also have, as I mentioned, the Calypso AxiomSL. And then the third one is actually looking at our Verafin clients across the United States and offering both treasury management as well some AxiomSL regulatory reporting solutions to the broader bank community. So those are the areas where we're doing strategic campaigns, and we're definitely seeing that feeding the funnel. But also, frankly, as I mentioned in July, we have one of our great Tier 1 clients for AxiomSL and Calypso has now signed up to take Verafin. So I think the strength of our relationship with them across all of our, frankly, all of our business has been a driver of having them trust us with their anti-financial crime needs as well.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping we could start with discussion on momentum you guys are seeing at Adenza. And you provided a number of different KPIs, both in terms of the upsells and sign -- and the number of new clients you've signed and the cross-selling. Can you help us maybe frame what the sort of KPIs mean in terms of the revenue opportunity you see on the back of these wins? So I don't know if it's a revenue pipeline or revenue backlog, you kind of set of frame around these wins. But just trying to better understand what this could mean in terms of revenue growth? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I mean I think that the best way to measure that is through ARR. So because the ARR, the contract values of the new sales are factored into ARR in terms of the annualized contract value. And so that as you see the ARR coming in, I think it's 13% across all of FinTech. And then we've given you the ARR growth for each of the subdivisions, it really does help you have a predictive effect on the subscription revenue that's coming in across those businesses going forward. And I think we give you a lot of the ARR figures both in the script and in the release and presentation. So I think that's what we look at in terms of the overall health of the business, the overall health of how we look at the forward potential of the subscription revenue. And then, of course, there is also the professional services revenues, and we try to give you some understanding of the dynamics there. As we've mentioned before, for the AxiomSL and Calypso combined properties, when we look at the overall outlook for the business, meaning some outlook for revenue, it's slightly below our ARR expectations because of the fact that professional services fees grows a little bit more slowly in general over a long period of time than the subscription revenues. But that's -- I think that's the way to kind of evaluate the business.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Awesome. Helpful. So, and then on Verafin, you highlighted the Tier 1 international bank, which is I know is an important market for the firm. Can we maybe spend a little more time on sort of how you see an opportunity set and the revenue contribution from international markets shaping out for Verafin as you kind of push further into that market?\nAdena Friedman: Yes, great. Well, first of all, today, the Tier 1, Tier 2 banks, the revenue contribution is still very small because we're still signing new clients, we're implementing them. We don't start recognizing the revenue until we implement in terms of making sure that we have them up and running. And the implementation times are ranging from, I would say, six months to a year depending on the complexity of implementation. So and most of the new sales that we've had in the Tier 1, Tier 2 space have focused on payments fraud. We also have this new consortia-based check fraud solution that's really exciting that we're definitely driving demand. And as we go into the international banks, one of the things that we've been focused on, both in Canada and the UK, is looking at payments fraud across kind of what I'll call international payments fraud into their US operations in other parts of the world. But that's where we really have this incredible strength in our business and in our solution. We can cut down false positives anywhere from, frankly, 20% to 40% depending on how they implement it. We can increase fraud found, and that's been really exciting for the banks to see. We run these proof-of-concepts to prove out the solution, and it's pretty remarkable actually as to the benefit they get. Taking that proof-of-concept and turning to a contract takes time. So we are super excited to see our latest Tier 1 signed in July. The proof-of-concept was done probably by April or so, just to give you a sense.\nAlexander Blostein: Great. Awesome. All right. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: All right. Good morning. Maybe just the first question on the deleveraging that's coming in ahead of expectations. You noted that repaying the additional CP is a priority, but I think there's only $50 million left on that, and I think you're generating close to $250 million plus of free cash flow for dividends. So can you just help us frame what's the preference here in terms of enacting further repurchases opportunistically on a go-forward basis after you repay the $50 million remaining or should we think about the priority really getting that net leverage lower and simply letting the cash build up on the balance sheet near term?\nSarah Youngwood: Thank you very much, Kyle. So we remain focused on the capital priorities that we have outlined at Investor Day. So of course, always the organic growth first and then the deleveraging remains very important. So you are right that we would start with the CP and the balance that you mentioned is approximately correct. And then after that, we would be opportunistic. We, first of all, have done about half of the employee dilution-related share repurchases. So I think you would expect us to continue to do that. And we use the word opportunistic, flexible because there are other things we could be doing, which is around either debt or equity.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. Understood. And then just a follow-up, and I hate to use this as a question, but I just wanted to clarify something specifically that you said, Sarah, on the Listings business. And I know you said $3 million of initial listings amortization headwind starting in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Just can I clarify, is that on a year-over-year basis? Or are you talking about an incremental $3 million headwind on a sequential basis in 3Q and then another $3 million sequentially in 4Q?\nSarah Youngwood: So what I gave is that in 2Q, it's $1 million year-on-year. And then in 3Q and after for the following three also, it would be $3 million. So you could add two on the sequential, but it's year-on-year. So $3 million year-on-year, $1 million becomes $3 million between 2Q and 3Q.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cho: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to follow up on Verafin as well. Just Adena you talked through kind of the proof-of-concepts going and kind of the, it seems like it would seem like a pretty quick turnaround for the most recent Tier 1 from April and to planning in July. I mean, can you just give any more color around the pipeline and the additional proof-of-concepts you're undertaking right now for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 clients? And then just like broader, longer term, like what do you think the right pace of new client additions should be for this cohort of Tier 1, Tier 2 clients as we look further down the road as that sales force scale as well?\nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure. Yes. So right now, we've actually had an increasing number of POCs and we're -- we don't give specific numbers, but it's a really healthy number of clients evaluating our solution with the proof-of-concepts that we have underway. Over time, we'd like to actually think we won't have to run as many because we'll have proven the solution out enough times across clients that it just becomes something that people fully understand and they don't necessarily need a proof-of-concept, which is why we're -- right now that number is building as we're gaining more traction, we're signing clients. More clients are curious about it and they want to understand the benefit to them. But over a period of years, we'd like to think that it will just become part of the flywheel. So I would say right now, we should continue to expect a small number of clients over a period of a year, not necessarily every quarter, as we've kind of shown, but hopefully, we're going to see more momentum and more regular signings in the years ahead. So it just -- it builds on itself. And that certainly has been the experience of Verafin over time, and they leg into a new segment of the banking industry. They'll get 1s or 2s kind of in a quarterly basis, it will start to trickle in and then it starts to become more of a regular pace. And then they start to really demonstrate the strength, particularly with the consortium data that they have that really kind of feeds on itself and, therefore, it gains momentum. But I can't give you a specific, I wish I could, give you a specific understanding of how much time that would take. But we're definitely measuring in a period of years at a time like how do we gain more momentum, how do we sign more clients in the years to come. But that's about as much color as I can give you right now.\nMichael Cho: Okay. No, that's great. Thank you. And then just for a follow-up, just inside Capital Markets Tech within FinTech, clearly, some good revenue tailwinds passing there. I mean I think you've called out a few moving pieces there, but can you just watch out maybe the quarterly -- quarter-to-quarter uptick in revenues and if there's anything onetime or large from clients there? And then I think you also mentioned maybe like more normalized quarterly year-over-year growth in the second half versus first half. Can you just flesh that comment as well? Thank you.\nSarah Youngwood: Sure. So basically, what we had is really a broad momentum across our businesses, but specifically here also in the Calypso where we had one of strategic early renewal, but also 29 upsells and several new clients and so it was five new clients. And so as you look forward, you are going to continue to see solid momentum in the business. And we told you also that 2024 would remain in line with our medium-term outlook. But of course given the type of first half we have had, I think, it was not a surprise that we mentioned that we would expect more normalized growth across the products within the division versus the first half of the year. And also we pointed out consistent growth across quarters. And so this is what we said at the Capital Markets Technology revenue level.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. And I just want to make sure, it was actually within the subdivision, which is the Capital Markets subdivision. Yes.\nMichael Cho: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yes. So I just wanted to go back Adena to your comments on the IPO environment. It sounded like you said that you expected the landscape to sort of improve throughout the remainder of the year, but you didn't expect it to manifest until the first half of 2025. So could you maybe just clarify your expectations for the rest of this year and when you expect that to show up in the financials?\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I think we've seen a modest improvement year-over-year. I think in a way, I think we've all been surprised by the fact that you've got strong market performance in general, but a continued, I would say, muted IPO environment. Now we are seeing a very good week. We have the largest IPO of the year happening today, and we had another great IPO yesterday. But I think that we still are seeing it coming trickling in like that, not necessarily a steady stream of IPOs coming to market in size. And so as we look out over the pipeline and certainly, the conversations we've had with clients, we do think that we'll continue to see a modest improvement year-over-year in the IPO environment, which, of course, last year was not a strong year. But as we -- a lot of the conversations we're having, particularly in the technology space, has been more geared towards the first half of 2025. Now that's changed, right? So if we can -- if there's some positive momentum that happens in the economy, positive things that are happening as we go through the fall, I think you could see the door opening up because more and more companies are getting ready to go out. But I'd still think a lot of them are thinking that they'll wait past the year and go in 2025.\nPatrick Moley: Okay. Great. And then just a follow-up on index options, you're seeing really strong momentum there. I think you mentioned that revenues have doubled versus last year. Volumes were up, I think, 50% year-over-year. So it does seem like you're taking price there. Could you maybe just update us on the broader vision for index options in Nasdaq and maybe your approach to pricing potentially at the expense of not picking up as much market share as you'd like? Just kind of how you think about that.\nAdena Friedman: Well, I think, first of all, we're really excited about how the index options business is developing. And I think that the trading ecosystem as well as investors are recognizing the benefits of being able to hedge their index exposure through the options market. And obviously, we've seen that with other index franchises, but now with the NASDAQ 100, we're really building momentum and leveraging both futures, where futures volumes were up 25% year-over-year a quarter, as well as in terms of the options business. And now you have more ability to do that. So very excited about where that's going. It is something where we have it as a premium part of our options franchise because I think that the benefits that our clients are getting from the hedging capabilities are very strong. And so it kind of warrants the fees that we charge there. It is not having a -- that's not having an impact on demand. The demand is really strong and continuing to grow. Now we've done a lot of work. There's been a lot of leg work over the last several years to build up an understanding of the options, how to use hedging. We have a data capability that we give out, we provide to the clients to help them understand just do a lot of analytics on it to help them understand how to use the options the right way. And so the educational process we've had, frankly, over three years, I think, is really now paying off. And we expect to continue to grow. We will be looking at additional indexes, additional indexes that we want to bring on to our index options franchise. But even now, the other thing I would mention is that there's also a really pulled flywheel back to the index business. So the index team and the options team have been working hand-in-hand to make this work really well because there's benefit back to the institutional community with index and their ability then to have better hedging tools and their ability, therefore, to adopt our index products more successfully. So that's another part of the flywheel that's coming out of this.\nPatrick Moley: Very helpful. Thanks, Adena.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nAdena Friedman: Good morning, Craig.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we had a question on Solovis. Back in May, Bloomberg reported that you're considering a sale of Solovis and while this could help you reach your financial leverage target faster and maybe the next deal. We were just curious, given the news because Solovis is strategic fits pretty well within your objective to provide software data and other services in the financial service ecosystem. And arguably, there's other businesses, maybe like the Nordic Exchange, which doesn't fit as well. So I was just wondering if you could comment on the potential for Nasdaq to sell existing businesses. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So I won't comment on any particular rumor that's out there. But I would just say this, we do a very detailed review every year of our capital allocation. We look at our businesses strategically, financially across several different factors and evaluate how each one of them fits into our overall client experience and making sure that we're always the right owner for the businesses. And as you've known since I became CEO, many years ago now, 7.5 years ago, we've made decisions to divest of certain businesses where either we're just not the right owner of the business because our clients are not seeing us as a strategic owner. They might see us as an owner. They definitely understand that we own the business, but they might not necessarily strategic to our franchise or we have capital allocation priorities that really skewed towards different parts of our business. In terms of you know you did mention areas of our business. I would say, I do want to say one thing. We view our Nordic business to be very strategic to Nasdaq. And I've said this on prior calls, the Nordic Exchange business, they are the best exchanges in Europe. The innovation ecosystem that exists in the Nordic is incredible and very consistent with the US. And I would say that we do a great job of operating those markets and we're really proud to be the operator of the Nordic market. The other thing is the team there is really contributes a lot to our broader technology business. So we deploy members of the Nordic team out to work and help our market tech clients around the world. We have a great set of clients in the Nordics that are now wonderful clients in our FinTech solutions. So there's a lot of strategic intersection with our Nordic business. I do want to provide a defense of that. But generally, Craig, we do this work, and we make these decisions over time because that we look at it as in terms of the long-term strategic fit to Nasdaq.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Adena. And just I had a follow-up on the response to the last question on index options and specifically the NASDAQ 100 Index. What is your desire and ability to expand NDX with zero DT options? And then also with rising retail engagement and there's a lot of interest around tech overall, so it fits perfectly in here. I was curious on your comment about launching other indexes. I'm just curious in terms of what you could do there.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. I mean, we always look at our index products that we think, as you mentioned, have really strong retail appeal, but also institutional appeal, where they're large enough and there's enough assets in there to drive liquidity into a future or an options product. And really looking at it from a hedging perspective. We have a whole range of index products beyond the NASDAQ 100. We have thematic indexes in terms of different technology trends like cloud and IT security, AI. We have thematics across different investment strategies like momentum strategies, dividend strategies, things like that. And so to the extent we think that there actually could be a trading ecosystem we could build around that, we will consider it. I don't -- we don't have any particular index product right now that we're targeting. But I would say that we do a lot of great analysis on that. And then in terms of how we structure the options and how we look at option duration, we will obviously evaluate that in the context of investor appetite and we'll work with the SEC on that when appropriate.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to come back to what you called out on Calypso or Capital Markets with that early strategic renewal. Can you just explain what exactly happened there? Why? And is that something that we should expect more often? And then maybe related to that, on the impact side, looks like ARR up $25 million quarter-over-quarter in that segment. Can you dimensionalize how big that renewal specifically was? Also on the transactional side, you beat me pretty handily, so maybe more than $10 million. Is it all related to that? So just trying to understand how big some of these individual renewals could be. Thank you.\nAdena Friedman: Yes. So I'd actually say that having early renewals is not totally unusual, right? I mean, if we call it out just because it was -- we're really excited about the fact that we had a strategic client who chose to renew early and extend their contract. And I think that it's something that we're proud of. Now with, as we mentioned, with Calypso revenue, just to remind everyone, our view is that ARR is a very good reflection of how you should look at the overall health of the business, the stability. Because of the fact that the license fees, you have half the license revenue recognized upfront and half recognized over the life of the contract. But our cash revenue, how we get the cash in the door and the overall ACV value of those contracts is better reflected in ARR. So we continue to see the ARR being very stable, very healthy. We think that's fantastic. We will have events like this early renewal that happened on occasion. We also had, as we mentioned, five new other clients, 29 upsells, all of that, Alex, contributed to the strong revenue in the quarter. But over time, I think, as Sarah was saying, over time, kind of looking at ARR is a better reflection of the overall growth characteristics of the business. I think it's a better way to look at it over time as opposed to in a single quarter.\nSarah Youngwood: Yes. The only thing I would add is, by definition, ARR impact of a renewal is not as much as a new client or an upsell. And then so if you were focused on why we had a good performance on ARR at Calypso or in Capital Markets deck, it was really because of the breadth of everything that has happened.\nAlex Kramm: That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then secondarily, topic that we talked about a lot a few years ago on the back of a strong listings environment that we had at that point, there was a lot of excitement around eventually getting IR solutions on the back of that when those start paying. I know, obviously, there's been a decent amount of delistings since then. So I guess this is not really coming through, but maybe you can just tell us where we are in that, if you're still seeing a decent amount of upsells? Or is that, unfortunately, it's just not coming to fruition given the kind of companies that were listed three years ago or so?\nAdena Friedman: Actually, we are seeing conversions of our clients to paying clients at the end of the free period. So that is still happening, Alex. But I think that there are other headwinds. So a few things to mention on IR services, and I would actually say this across Corporate Solutions. So the first thing is that we obviously gain new clients through IPOs, right? So that's one of the avenues for us to gain new clients, whether that's for our IR solutions or ESG solutions and our governance solutions. So that is definitely a funnel, a pipeline for us. Now some they then become paying clients on their base services over a period of two to four years, depending on the kind of the way that the IPO is structured. But we also can upsell clients in that period of time. So when you have a healthy IPO environment, you have new companies coming in, and then you're showing them the base services and you can upsell them on new services, that really does become a really nice flywheel right after the IPO. And then you have an additional opportunity when, as you mentioned, the IPO package rolls off. And those IPO packages are rolling off. And so we are still seeing that happen. But the flip side of it is when you have delistings, then you have paying clients who are no longer listed, and that obviously creates churn. And you have other clients who are continuing to take the services, but they are -- they're maybe taking fewer services because their IR budgets are being squeezed. And so that's becoming the contra, I'll call it, the contra flywheel of having more delistings. I would say when we look at the overall conversion rates, they are lower than what we've seen on an average basis. But they are -- but I think that's partly because of the fact that some of the companies are delisting. But those who are seeing this, they were seeing relatively normalized conversion rate.\nAlex Kramm: All right. Great color. Thank you so much.\nAdena Friedman: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So for AI, you have many initiatives going on. And when we look at Dynamic M-ELO, you highlighted a 20% increase in both volumes and improvement in fill rate. Could you please talk about how it could impact your market shares and financials over time and how difficult it is for your client -- for your competitor to launch similar products? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Owen. Well, I'd say on the first question, this is kind of a specialized order type. So it's not going to be something that's going to have a massive effect on market share, but it is a premium product. So our clients get a huge value out of it. It's a really nice way to get a higher fill rate in size at the midpoint. So it's a really -- it's a premium product in terms of the pricing that we charge. So it's more of a revenue opportunity than it is a market share opportunity. In terms of being able to replicate it, we do provide in our filing and explanation of how we do it. But I would tell you that it took several years for us to fine tune it with our AI team, data science team. It's actually quite complicated and complex to structure the right way, to make sure you're getting the right outcomes. We're constantly fine-tuning the various data points and the weightings of those data points as to how they're affecting the timer on the product. So I would say it's actually extremely hard to replicate, even though kind of look at it like the formula is available, but how you actually manage that formula is very much a part of the greatness of our technology division, frankly.\nOwen Lau: Got it. And then for Financial Crime Management Technology, we heard that some other enterprise software companies had to lower the ARR guidance because of some uncertainty in the macro environment, but the momentum in your business seems to be quite robust. And you highlighted the new Tier 1 clients signed in July. Could you please remind us how Verafin could fare or grow in different macro environments? Is there any reason we should be worried about if the macro environment turn? Thanks.\nAdena Friedman: Sure. Well, I would actually talk about, let's talk about the FinTech level, and then we can talk about it in specific areas. But the way that we look at our FinTech solutions is we provide mission-critical technology that helps clients manage risk, manage their regulatory obligations and manage criminals out of their networks, as well as providing core capital markets technology to the entire exchange ecosystem. So it is -- to us, those are very durable, durable kind of demand drivers. Managing risk, as the world gets more complicated, the world gets more risky. And I think our ability at a global scale, on a global level to be able to help our clients manage risk in their trading books, in their treasury operations in their capital obligations, as well as also the managed risk in markets is just -- it's tremendous, honestly. And so I think that has actually been a really great demand driver. I think that as we look at the regulatory obligations, those are extremely durable around the world. Different regulators go at different paces, but there's always regulation that's changing. Now changes, it's really changes in regulations that drive demand as well as the growth. If banks are growing and expanding their businesses into new countries, that also drives great demand. And so those are things that are also quite durable. I think then on anti-financial crime, as we've mentioned before, it's a $3.5 trillion problem between anti-money laundering and fraud, we are just getting started. And so it's not just the fact that the TAM is really large, the total market opportunity, but our solution is unique. I think our solution is remarkable in terms of the way that we bring data together, the way that we are able to look at consortium data in a way that really allows us to be very curated in the topologies we apply using AI and in automating workflows to make it as efficient as possible, then I think that creates a great opportunity for us. And we're only really in North America today. So we have a lot of opportunity globally there. So I think, Owen, that we've chosen to get into this business in a way with very specific ambitions to be that solutions provider of their most complex challenges that the banks face in all economic environments and that is what we think is going to create durable growth for us.\nOwen Lau: Got it. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Adena Friedman for closing remarks.\nAdena Friedman: Thank you. Well, as you heard this morning, Nasdaq continues to make progress on our three key priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. And through our complementary and integrated solutions, Nasdaq is delivering consistent growth, and the One Nasdaq strategy is accelerating our evolution as a trusted technology provider to the financial services industry. We look forward to updating you on our strategic progress in the quarters to come. And thank you all for joining and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. On the call this morning, I'll provide some perspective on the external environment, discuss our strong quarterly performance highlights as well as our progress against our strategic priorities, and then I'll hand the call to Sarah to walk through the financial results in more detail. Turning to the economy in the US, we're continuing to see solid, but slowing GDP growth, along with cooling inflation and slightly rising unemployment. These data points support the potential for easing monetary policy in the coming months as the Fed continues to strive for an economic soft landing. The general stability in the US economy and the potential for a lower cost of capital going forward is resulting in modest improvements in the IPO landscape as we progress through 2024, including solid activity this week. However, investors continue to contend with external uncertainties and the timing of monetary policy shifts as well as our dynamic macro political environment. As a result, we continue to expect modestly improving IPO activity for the remainder of 2024, and our current US IPO pipeline indicates that stronger momentum is likely to manifest starting in the first half of 2025. We're also seeing stronger economic underpinnings in Europe, aided by the ECB's easing monetary policy, including improving economic prospects in the Nordics. The improvement is not yet translating into a material increase in new public issuances, but our European IPO pipeline is healthy and growing, particularly for 2025. As investors and industry participants navigate the dynamic market environment, we continue to see sustained robust trading activity in the markets as well as strong demand for mission-critical technology solutions from financial institutions globally. As a result, our markets continue to experience strong volumes, and client demand for our FinTech solutions remains consistent with trends we have seen through the cycle, which provides a healthy backdrop for continued revenue growth across our solutions suite. Now let me turn to our financial results, which demonstrate the power and resilience of our diversified business model and our ability to succeed through economic cycles. We delivered a strong quarter with $1.2 billion in net revenues, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with solutions revenues at 13% growth. Our overall annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 7% to $2.7 billion. I'm particularly pleased with the strength of the performance across our business, which is a testament to the power of our platform. We're integrating the Adenza acquisition ahead of schedule and are realizing the investment thesis that underpin the transaction as we demonstrate its value for clients, shareholders and employees. Our expenses for the quarter increased 7% year-over-year, within our guidance. Our operating income grew approximately 14%. And importantly, our operating margin increased to 53%, representing over one percentage point of operating leverage while we continue to invest to support growth in our business and deliver on synergies. Turning now to a discussion of the business highlights, starting with capital access platforms. While ARR growth in the division remained at 1%, our index revenue grew 29%, resulting in overall revenue growth for capital access platforms of 10%. In Listings, we welcomed 31 operating company IPOs maintaining our strong win rate of 72% based on Nasdaq eligible listings. While the slower IPO environment remains a headwind, we're encouraged by signs of improvement, as supported by our most recent IPO Pulse Index, which is near a three-year high. Overall growth in data and listings continue to experience challenges as modest growth in market data and the slowly improving IPO environment were offset by the impact of prior year delistings. Growth in our analytics business benefited from continued demand across the investment community for actionable intelligence and increased efficiency. However, that growth was partially offset by continued headwinds in corporate solutions, resulting in more muted growth for workflow and insights. Our index business delivered another exceptional quarter with $17 billion of net inflows during the quarter, totaling $53 billion over the last 12 months. We also achieved another record in Index ETP AUM exiting the quarter at $569 billion. Turning next to Financial Technology. ARR growth across the division was 13%, including 25% in Financial Crime Management Technology, 14% in the combined AxiomSL and Calypso solutions and 9% in the combined Market Technology and Trade Management Services. The division had 69 new client signings, 96 upsells and 4 cross-sells. We also saw continued cloud adoption as 68% of AxiomSL and Calypso 's combined bookings in the quarter were cloud-based with a strong pipeline for future quarters. Turning to the specific subdivisions. Financial Crime Management Technology continued its strong momentum. We signed over 50 new clients in the SMB space, and we continue to make progress in the Upmarket segment focused on Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. In July, we signed a new international Tier 1 bank, which is also an exciting cross-sell. Going forward, we continue to maintain a strong sales pipeline within the core SMB segment, and we have a growing pipeline of new clients and upsells among Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks. Across Regulatory Technology, we see sustained demand across both existing and new clients as financial institutions face increasingly dynamic regulatory environment, including changes in regulation globally related to asset thresholds. Among the many regulatory trends that are driving sales demand, we're pleased with our progress in signing clients around the world as they focus on implementing Basel IV and preparing to implement Basel III end game. In Capital Markets Technology, we continue to see strong demand for mission-critical technology as many of our clients focused on modernizing their infrastructure to enhance resilience and performance. For Calypso, we see robust new demand, especially in the Treasury segment in addition to cloud transformation of large-scale clients. In our Market Services division, we delivered revenue growth of 3%. We experienced healthy volumes across North America and Europe, and we achieved a sequential increase in North American options market share as well as growth in Nasdaq US equities on-exchange market share and capture. Our US index options achieved record revenues, more than doubling versus last year, due to higher capture and volumes. In our US Cash Equities business, we executed successful Russell, MSCI and S&P rebalances during the quarter, which showcased the strength and resiliency of our markets. During the Russell event, for instance, nearly 2.9 billion shares, representing a record notional value of over $95 billion, were executed in the Closing Cross, representing the largest liquidity event on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange or the Russell Reconstitution. In our European markets, the strength of our market ecosystem, as evidenced by the depth of book, breadth of participants and product innovation continues to drive market share gains. Overall, we're pleased to report a solid quarter of market services and remain focused on retaining our leading position across all of our markets. I now want to spend a few minutes updating you on how we're executing against our 2024 strategic priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. Starting with integrate, we have actioned over 70% of the $80 million of net expense synergies, and our leverage ratio reached 3.9 times at quarter-end, both ahead of plan. Both AxiomSL and Calypso are fully integrated into the Financial Technology division and we've established strong leadership, a well-structured operating model and a One Nasdaq go-to-market approach to ensure we're delivering for our clients with the highest level of efficiency and effectiveness. Our CRM's integration for the Calypso and Axiom solutions is now completed ahead of schedule, and this supports divisional sales coordination as well as the sales incentive program established at the beginning of the year. Importantly, across AxiomSL, Calypso and Verafin, we've been highly focused on cultural integration into the broader Nasdaq enterprise. And internal surveys continue to show that our employees are highly engaged and energized to deliver for our clients. We're also making strong progress advancing our innovate priority. We currently have approximately 50% of our employee base working with AI tools focused on enhancing productivity as well as driving our product road map. By the end of Q3, 100% of our developers will have access to AI copilot tools and we recently had over 650 employees participate in several AI hackathons across Nasdaq. During the quarter, we continued to introduce new AI capabilities within our client-facing solutions. Consistent with other Gen AI capabilities recently launched in our Verafin and Boardvantage solutions, with an investment, we have deployed a new AI-powered feature for the Market Lens module called Pension Meeting Minute Summarization. The feature provides asset managers with key insights on current and future pension fund strategies to help inform their business development and engagement priorities with top pension decision makers. We also have a strong pipeline of AI features scheduled to launch in the coming quarters, including in Market Surveillance and IR Insight. And we're seeing strong early traction in client adoption and effectiveness related to the capabilities that are already in market. Specifically, Dynamic M-ELO, the first SEC approved AI order type, which we launched in April, is driving a 20% increase in both volumes for this order type and improvement in fill rates compared to the prior static version. Verafin's integrated Gen AI feature, Entity Research Copilot, is now deployed at more than 250 clients and we expect to complete our rollout in the third quarter. Client feedback has been positive, demonstrating that the integrated copilot functionality with the integrated copilot functionality, Verafin solutions can reduce alert research time by up to 90% compared to banks that do not use Verafin. Beyond AI, we continue to drive innovation towards key growth priorities. For example, in our Index business, innovation is at the heart of our growth strategy as we extend the franchise to new markets globally, drive institutional adoption and introduce new products beyond the NASDAQ 100. During the quarter, 50% of index product launches were outside of the United States. And we're quickly gaining traction in investor adoption. In total, we launched 18 new products with our partners, including 12 ETPs and three insurance annuity vehicles geared towards our institutional clients. Additionally, we're pleased that our AI-themed ETP saw more than $1 billion of inflows over the last 12 months. Wrapping up with our Accelerate priority. The addition of AxiomSL and Calypso has significantly elevated the dialogue we have with our clients as a strategic partner. There's no better evidence of that than the early traction we're seeing in our cross-sell efforts. Since closing the transaction, we have executed on 11 FinTech cross-sells. We had four this quarter, including two cross-sells of our AxiomSL solution, two Calypso clients. This is a great start, but it's only the beginning on our journey to exceed $100 million in cross-sells by the end of 2027. Just eight months since the acquisition closed, 10% of the opportunities in our pipeline are cross-sells, and we expect this to grow sequentially. The division has several strategic cross-sell campaigns underway, which are generating strong top-of-funnel interest and underpins our continued confidence in our ability to grow cross-sell bookings over the coming years. To wrap up, we're pleased to deliver a quarter of strong results, driven by continued momentum in solutions and the power of our diversified platform to drive scalable, profitable and durable growth. Importantly, we're delivering on the Adenza acquisition thesis as our clients increasingly see Nasdaq as a strategic partner that can help solve their largest, most complex challenges. We look forward to leveraging this momentum to unlock our next phase of growth. And with that I'll now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details. Sure. Well, I would just say that as we've talked about in the past, price increases are different per product and kind of different from -- in terms of how we structure contracts with our clients within FinTech. So we don't provide you a very specific answer to that question. But I think that if we think about what we've said at least for the AxiomSL and Calypso products in the past is that about half of the revenue increase that we see in any given quarter comes from upgrades and upsells of our clients and the other half comes from new sales and price increases, the price changes we make within the contracts. Some of our contracts have CPI increases and somewhere -- what we would do is we would upsell our clients or increase price upon contract renewal. So that would mean that we would have a constant price for a period of time and then increased price on contract renewal. We do that on the basis of increased value to the clients or the fact that the clients themselves are growing and, therefore, they're getting more value out of the product. So that's -- it kind of depends on the product, Dan. Sure. Well, within the quarter, as I mentioned, we had four cross-sells, and two of them were selling AxiomSL to Calypso clients. And so that really comes from the fact that we have a really strong relationship with our clients. In Calypso, they have new regulatory obligations that they're having to become ready for and they've chosen to work with us. And one of the benefits we have is that we can actually -- we have a data API connector between those two products. So we can take data directly out of the Calypso platform and feed it into AxiomSL and make it much easier to implement the AxiomSL solution for those regulatory obligations. So that is definitely helping to drive demand. We also -- in terms of our cross-sell campaigns, we have one cross-sell campaign that's really focused on our exchange clients where we have clients -- where we provide clearing technology and Calypso has amazing collateral management capabilities. And so we are working with them to show the benefits of adding the Calypso collateral management into their clearing operations. I mean, then we also have, as I mentioned, the Calypso AxiomSL. And then the third one is actually looking at our Verafin clients across the United States and offering both treasury management as well some AxiomSL regulatory reporting solutions to the broader bank community. So those are the areas where we're doing strategic campaigns, and we're definitely seeing that feeding the funnel. But also, frankly, as I mentioned in July, we have one of our great Tier 1 clients for AxiomSL and Calypso has now signed up to take Verafin. So I think the strength of our relationship with them across all of our, frankly, all of our business has been a driver of having them trust us with their anti-financial crime needs as well. Yes. I mean I think that the best way to measure that is through ARR. So because the ARR, the contract values of the new sales are factored into ARR in terms of the annualized contract value. And so that as you see the ARR coming in, I think it's 13% across all of FinTech. And then we've given you the ARR growth for each of the subdivisions, it really does help you have a predictive effect on the subscription revenue that's coming in across those businesses going forward. And I think we give you a lot of the ARR figures both in the script and in the release and presentation. So I think that's what we look at in terms of the overall health of the business, the overall health of how we look at the forward potential of the subscription revenue. And then, of course, there is also the professional services revenues, and we try to give you some understanding of the dynamics there. As we've mentioned before, for the AxiomSL and Calypso combined properties, when we look at the overall outlook for the business, meaning some outlook for revenue, it's slightly below our ARR expectations because of the fact that professional services fees grows a little bit more slowly in general over a long period of time than the subscription revenues. But that's -- I think that's the way to kind of evaluate the business. Yes, great. Well, first of all, today, the Tier 1, Tier 2 banks, the revenue contribution is still very small because we're still signing new clients, we're implementing them. We don't start recognizing the revenue until we implement in terms of making sure that we have them up and running. And the implementation times are ranging from, I would say, six months to a year depending on the complexity of implementation. So and most of the new sales that we've had in the Tier 1, Tier 2 space have focused on payments fraud. We also have this new consortia-based check fraud solution that's really exciting that we're definitely driving demand. And as we go into the international banks, one of the things that we've been focused on, both in Canada and the UK, is looking at payments fraud across kind of what I'll call international payments fraud into their US operations in other parts of the world. But that's where we really have this incredible strength in our business and in our solution. We can cut down false positives anywhere from, frankly, 20% to 40% depending on how they implement it. We can increase fraud found, and that's been really exciting for the banks to see. We run these proof-of-concepts to prove out the solution, and it's pretty remarkable actually as to the benefit they get. Taking that proof-of-concept and turning to a contract takes time. So we are super excited to see our latest Tier 1 signed in July. The proof-of-concept was done probably by April or so, just to give you a sense. Yes, sure. Yes. So right now, we've actually had an increasing number of POCs and we're -- we don't give specific numbers, but it's a really healthy number of clients evaluating our solution with the proof-of-concepts that we have underway. Over time, we'd like to actually think we won't have to run as many because we'll have proven the solution out enough times across clients that it just becomes something that people fully understand and they don't necessarily need a proof-of-concept, which is why we're -- right now that number is building as we're gaining more traction, we're signing clients. More clients are curious about it and they want to understand the benefit to them. But over a period of years, we'd like to think that it will just become part of the flywheel. So I would say right now, we should continue to expect a small number of clients over a period of a year, not necessarily every quarter, as we've kind of shown, but hopefully, we're going to see more momentum and more regular signings in the years ahead. So it just -- it builds on itself. And that certainly has been the experience of Verafin over time, and they leg into a new segment of the banking industry. They'll get 1s or 2s kind of in a quarterly basis, it will start to trickle in and then it starts to become more of a regular pace. And then they start to really demonstrate the strength, particularly with the consortium data that they have that really kind of feeds on itself and, therefore, it gains momentum. But I can't give you a specific, I wish I could, give you a specific understanding of how much time that would take. But we're definitely measuring in a period of years at a time like how do we gain more momentum, how do we sign more clients in the years to come. But that's about as much color as I can give you right now. Yes. And I just want to make sure, it was actually within the subdivision, which is the Capital Markets subdivision. Yes. Sure. Sure. Well, I think we've seen a modest improvement year-over-year. I think in a way, I think we've all been surprised by the fact that you've got strong market performance in general, but a continued, I would say, muted IPO environment. Now we are seeing a very good week. We have the largest IPO of the year happening today, and we had another great IPO yesterday. But I think that we still are seeing it coming trickling in like that, not necessarily a steady stream of IPOs coming to market in size. And so as we look out over the pipeline and certainly, the conversations we've had with clients, we do think that we'll continue to see a modest improvement year-over-year in the IPO environment, which, of course, last year was not a strong year. But as we -- a lot of the conversations we're having, particularly in the technology space, has been more geared towards the first half of 2025. Now that's changed, right? So if we can -- if there's some positive momentum that happens in the economy, positive things that are happening as we go through the fall, I think you could see the door opening up because more and more companies are getting ready to go out. But I'd still think a lot of them are thinking that they'll wait past the year and go in 2025. Well, I think, first of all, we're really excited about how the index options business is developing. And I think that the trading ecosystem as well as investors are recognizing the benefits of being able to hedge their index exposure through the options market. And obviously, we've seen that with other index franchises, but now with the NASDAQ 100, we're really building momentum and leveraging both futures, where futures volumes were up 25% year-over-year a quarter, as well as in terms of the options business. And now you have more ability to do that. So very excited about where that's going. It is something where we have it as a premium part of our options franchise because I think that the benefits that our clients are getting from the hedging capabilities are very strong. And so it kind of warrants the fees that we charge there. It is not having a -- that's not having an impact on demand. The demand is really strong and continuing to grow. Now we've done a lot of work. There's been a lot of leg work over the last several years to build up an understanding of the options, how to use hedging. We have a data capability that we give out, we provide to the clients to help them understand just do a lot of analytics on it to help them understand how to use the options the right way. And so the educational process we've had, frankly, over three years, I think, is really now paying off. And we expect to continue to grow. We will be looking at additional indexes, additional indexes that we want to bring on to our index options franchise. But even now, the other thing I would mention is that there's also a really pulled flywheel back to the index business. So the index team and the options team have been working hand-in-hand to make this work really well because there's benefit back to the institutional community with index and their ability then to have better hedging tools and their ability, therefore, to adopt our index products more successfully. So that's another part of the flywheel that's coming out of this. Sure. Thank you. Good morning, Craig. Yes. So I won't comment on any particular rumor that's out there. But I would just say this, we do a very detailed review every year of our capital allocation. We look at our businesses strategically, financially across several different factors and evaluate how each one of them fits into our overall client experience and making sure that we're always the right owner for the businesses. And as you've known since I became CEO, many years ago now, 7.5 years ago, we've made decisions to divest of certain businesses where either we're just not the right owner of the business because our clients are not seeing us as a strategic owner. They might see us as an owner. They definitely understand that we own the business, but they might not necessarily strategic to our franchise or we have capital allocation priorities that really skewed towards different parts of our business. In terms of you know you did mention areas of our business. I would say, I do want to say one thing. We view our Nordic business to be very strategic to Nasdaq. And I've said this on prior calls, the Nordic Exchange business, they are the best exchanges in Europe. The innovation ecosystem that exists in the Nordic is incredible and very consistent with the US. And I would say that we do a great job of operating those markets and we're really proud to be the operator of the Nordic market. The other thing is the team there is really contributes a lot to our broader technology business. So we deploy members of the Nordic team out to work and help our market tech clients around the world. We have a great set of clients in the Nordics that are now wonderful clients in our FinTech solutions. So there's a lot of strategic intersection with our Nordic business. I do want to provide a defense of that. But generally, Craig, we do this work, and we make these decisions over time because that we look at it as in terms of the long-term strategic fit to Nasdaq. Yes. I mean, we always look at our index products that we think, as you mentioned, have really strong retail appeal, but also institutional appeal, where they're large enough and there's enough assets in there to drive liquidity into a future or an options product. And really looking at it from a hedging perspective. We have a whole range of index products beyond the NASDAQ 100. We have thematic indexes in terms of different technology trends like cloud and IT security, AI. We have thematics across different investment strategies like momentum strategies, dividend strategies, things like that. And so to the extent we think that there actually could be a trading ecosystem we could build around that, we will consider it. I don't -- we don't have any particular index product right now that we're targeting. But I would say that we do a lot of great analysis on that. And then in terms of how we structure the options and how we look at option duration, we will obviously evaluate that in the context of investor appetite and we'll work with the SEC on that when appropriate. Yes. So I'd actually say that having early renewals is not totally unusual, right? I mean, if we call it out just because it was -- we're really excited about the fact that we had a strategic client who chose to renew early and extend their contract. And I think that it's something that we're proud of. Now with, as we mentioned, with Calypso revenue, just to remind everyone, our view is that ARR is a very good reflection of how you should look at the overall health of the business, the stability. Because of the fact that the license fees, you have half the license revenue recognized upfront and half recognized over the life of the contract. But our cash revenue, how we get the cash in the door and the overall ACV value of those contracts is better reflected in ARR. So we continue to see the ARR being very stable, very healthy. We think that's fantastic. We will have events like this early renewal that happened on occasion. We also had, as we mentioned, five new other clients, 29 upsells, all of that, Alex, contributed to the strong revenue in the quarter. But over time, I think, as Sarah was saying, over time, kind of looking at ARR is a better reflection of the overall growth characteristics of the business. I think it's a better way to look at it over time as opposed to in a single quarter. Actually, we are seeing conversions of our clients to paying clients at the end of the free period. So that is still happening, Alex. But I think that there are other headwinds. So a few things to mention on IR services, and I would actually say this across Corporate Solutions. So the first thing is that we obviously gain new clients through IPOs, right? So that's one of the avenues for us to gain new clients, whether that's for our IR solutions or ESG solutions and our governance solutions. So that is definitely a funnel, a pipeline for us. Now some they then become paying clients on their base services over a period of two to four years, depending on the kind of the way that the IPO is structured. But we also can upsell clients in that period of time. So when you have a healthy IPO environment, you have new companies coming in, and then you're showing them the base services and you can upsell them on new services, that really does become a really nice flywheel right after the IPO. And then you have an additional opportunity when, as you mentioned, the IPO package rolls off. And those IPO packages are rolling off. And so we are still seeing that happen. But the flip side of it is when you have delistings, then you have paying clients who are no longer listed, and that obviously creates churn. And you have other clients who are continuing to take the services, but they are -- they're maybe taking fewer services because their IR budgets are being squeezed. And so that's becoming the contra, I'll call it, the contra flywheel of having more delistings. I would say when we look at the overall conversion rates, they are lower than what we've seen on an average basis. But they are -- but I think that's partly because of the fact that some of the companies are delisting. But those who are seeing this, they were seeing relatively normalized conversion rate. Sure. Thanks, Owen. Well, I'd say on the first question, this is kind of a specialized order type. So it's not going to be something that's going to have a massive effect on market share, but it is a premium product. So our clients get a huge value out of it. It's a really nice way to get a higher fill rate in size at the midpoint. So it's a really -- it's a premium product in terms of the pricing that we charge. So it's more of a revenue opportunity than it is a market share opportunity. In terms of being able to replicate it, we do provide in our filing and explanation of how we do it. But I would tell you that it took several years for us to fine tune it with our AI team, data science team. It's actually quite complicated and complex to structure the right way, to make sure you're getting the right outcomes. We're constantly fine-tuning the various data points and the weightings of those data points as to how they're affecting the timer on the product. So I would say it's actually extremely hard to replicate, even though kind of look at it like the formula is available, but how you actually manage that formula is very much a part of the greatness of our technology division, frankly. Sure. Well, I would actually talk about, let's talk about the FinTech level, and then we can talk about it in specific areas. But the way that we look at our FinTech solutions is we provide mission-critical technology that helps clients manage risk, manage their regulatory obligations and manage criminals out of their networks, as well as providing core capital markets technology to the entire exchange ecosystem. So it is -- to us, those are very durable, durable kind of demand drivers. Managing risk, as the world gets more complicated, the world gets more risky. And I think our ability at a global scale, on a global level to be able to help our clients manage risk in their trading books, in their treasury operations in their capital obligations, as well as also the managed risk in markets is just -- it's tremendous, honestly. And so I think that has actually been a really great demand driver. I think that as we look at the regulatory obligations, those are extremely durable around the world. Different regulators go at different paces, but there's always regulation that's changing. Now changes, it's really changes in regulations that drive demand as well as the growth. If banks are growing and expanding their businesses into new countries, that also drives great demand. And so those are things that are also quite durable. I think then on anti-financial crime, as we've mentioned before, it's a $3.5 trillion problem between anti-money laundering and fraud, we are just getting started. And so it's not just the fact that the TAM is really large, the total market opportunity, but our solution is unique. I think our solution is remarkable in terms of the way that we bring data together, the way that we are able to look at consortium data in a way that really allows us to be very curated in the topologies we apply using AI and in automating workflows to make it as efficient as possible, then I think that creates a great opportunity for us. And we're only really in North America today. So we have a lot of opportunity globally there. So I think, Owen, that we've chosen to get into this business in a way with very specific ambitions to be that solutions provider of their most complex challenges that the banks face in all economic environments and that is what we think is going to create durable growth for us. Thank you. Well, as you heard this morning, Nasdaq continues to make progress on our three key priorities of integrate, innovate and accelerate. And through our complementary and integrated solutions, Nasdaq is delivering consistent growth, and the One Nasdaq strategy is accelerating our evolution as a trusted technology provider to the financial services industry. We look forward to updating you on our strategic progress in the quarters to come. And thank you all for joining and have a great day."

            "name": "Sarah Youngwood",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, we made excellent progress in both the integration of Adenza and the accelerated paydown of debt. We actioned over 70% of net expense synergies six months ahead of schedule. We have also come in ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plans ending the quarter of 3.9 leverage. Turning to our second quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.2 billion, up 10%, with solutions revenue up 13%. Operating expense was $539 million, up 7% within our guidance with an operating margin of 53% and an EBITDA margin of 56%. Overall, this resulted in net income of $397 million and diluted EPS of $0.69. Slide 11 shows the drivers of our 10% pro forma revenue growth for the quarter. We generated 8% outside growth on a net basis, driven by new and existing clients as well as our focus on product innovation. Overall, beta factors were 2% this quarter, driven by higher valuations in Nasdaq indexes as well as higher overall volumes in market services. On Slide 12, we had 7% ARR growth. And as part of that, we had 17% SaaS revenue growth, resulting in SaaS as a percent of ARR now at 37%, up four percentage points. Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In capital assets platforms, we delivered revenue of $481 million, reflecting growth of 10%. We had another exceptional quarter for our Index business with revenue up 29%, driven by $53 billion of organic inflows in the last 12 months, including $17 billion this quarter, and market performance, both resulting in average ETP AUM of $531 billion. In addition, future volumes were up 25%. Data and Listings revenue was up 1%, while ARR was down 1%. The difference was driven by small one-time revenue benefits primarily related to listings. Revenue from higher data sales and usage, new listings and pricing offset the impact of delisting, downgrades and lower amortization of prior period initial listing fees. We expect the quarterly headwind from lower amortization of prior period listing fees to increase from an immaterial impact in 1Q '24 and approximately $1 million in 2Q '24 to about $3 million in each of the next four quarters. However, we have seen roughly 25% fewer delistings in the first half of the year versus the prior year period, suggesting that delistings should be less of a revenue headwind in 2025. Lastly, Workflow and Insights revenue was up 4%, in line with ARR growth of 4%. This was driven by continued growth in innovative analytics products, mainly Datalink and eVestment. This was partially offset by continued headwinds in Corporate Solutions. Analytics had a strong quarter with both revenue and ARR in high-single-digits. Operating margin was 56%, up one percentage point. Looking forward, we expect full year revenue growth for capital access platforms to exceed our medium-term growth outlook range with index expected to come in above its range. Workflow and Insights expected to come in below its range and with Data and Listings essentially flat year-on-year. Moving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. We had another quarter of strong growth with division revenue of $420 million, a 16% increase and with ARR growth of 13%. This performance reflects double-digit revenue and ARR growth across our three subdivisions. Financial Client Management Technology delivered 24% revenue growth and 25% ARR growth with 53 new clients in the quarter. Capital Markets Technology had revenue growth of 14% and ARR growth of 11%, on the back of seven new clients and 38 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by the timing of on-prem renewals and professional services fees. Together, Trade Management Services and Market Tech grew revenues 2%. We experienced strong subscription revenue and ARR growth, up 9% for both businesses and up three percentage points sequentially. The lower growth in revenue was due to year-over-year decline in Professional Services revenues. As we mentioned last quarter, in Market Tech, we had a very large implementation in 2023, which created a $27 million revenue benefit in the full year of 2023. And this year has resulted in subscription revenue or ARR of $11 million. We expect this year-over-year headwind to persist in Q3 and abate in Q4. Calypso had revenue growth of 34% and ARR growth of 13%. Revenue was higher than the expectation we provided in the first quarter call due to broad strength in sales activity, including a strategic early renewal, 29 upsells and five new clients. As we look forward, we continue to see solid momentum in the business and expect Capital Markets Technology revenue growth for 2024 to remain in line with our medium-term outlook. Overall, for the second half of 2024, we expect more normalized growth across the products within the division versus the first half of the year with consistent growth across quarters. Regulatory Technology had revenue growth of 16% and ARR growth of 10%, with seven new clients and 58 upsells in the quarter. The difference between revenue and ARR growth is driven by AxiomSL, which had 23% revenue growth and 14% ARR growth. The 23% revenue growth was primarily due to strong subscription revenue, including a large on-prem renewal, 29 upsells and one new client in the quarter, partially offset by a decline in professional services fees due to the timing of client deliveries. The FinTech operating margin was 47% in the second quarter, up three percentage points, including the benefit of synergy realization. As we finalize the business combination accounting for Adenza during the measurement period, let me update you on a change we are evaluating on AxiomSL. As part of this potential accounting change, we would recognize on-prem subscription-based revenue on a ratable basis over the contract term, whereas we currently recognize approximately 50% upfront. This is due to the frequency of critical mandatory regulatory updates that we implement and embed in the AxiomSL software throughout the contract term. We believe this change would enhance our financial reporting and would not change the Adenza medium-term outlook we had provided nor our ability to achieve it this year. If an adjustment is made, it would not have a material impact on Nasdaq overall, and 2Q would remain a strong quarter with FinTech revenue growth near the top of its medium-term outlook range, solutions revenue growth at the high end of its medium-term outlook range and AxiomSL and Calypso combined revenue growth above 20%. Importantly, combined ARR growth of 14% and net revenue retention of 111% would be unchanged. Specifically at the AxiomSL level, we expect subscription revenue growth to be more consistent going forward and remain in line with our medium-term outlook. AxiomSL's 2Q '24 subscription revenue growth would have been generally in line with ARR. However, the timing-related decline in professional services fees I mentioned earlier would have driven total AxiomSL revenue growth for the quarter to the low to mid-single digits. We expect to receive additional information to finalize our analysis in 3Q. And if we make the change, we will provide updated historical information by quarter for 2023 and the first half of 2024, during 3Q and ahead of reporting our 3Q earnings. Now wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $250 million for the quarter, up 3%. Growth was driven by higher volumes in cash equities in both North America and Europe as well as in US options, increased capture in North America equities, US index options high growth, share gains in European equities from a very strong base and one additional trading day. This was partially offset by lower share in US options and equities, though share for options was stronger sequentially and increased over the course of the quarter. We also had lower US state revenue. Market Services second quarter operating margin was 58%, a one percentage point decline from the prior year, primarily due to continued investments in market monetization and regulatory obligations. Moving on to non-GAAP operating expense on Slide 16. This quarter was $539 million, reflecting pro forma growth of 7% or $15 million sequentially. This is within the guidance we provided on our first quarter earnings call. And as a reminder, second quarter included the impact of annual merit adjustments and equity grants. All-in, we generated positive operating leverage with an increase in both operating and EBITDA margin of over one percentage point. This included the benefit of synergies this quarter and the funding of additional revenue-related expense. We originally targeted $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 2025. As of Q2, we have already actioned over 70% of that amount, six months ahead of schedule. The P&L benefit of the actions already taken represent approximately one percentage point reduction in expense growth in the first half of this year. Please note that the actions of 2Q and 3Q have a longer time line to expense recognition. And as such, we expect the full impact of synergies to moderate expense growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points for 2024. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP operating expense of $2.145 billion to $2.185 billion, reflecting an increase to the bottom end of the range to account for strong revenue generation, which increases variable compensation and enables us to invest in growth initiatives while also accounting for the synergy benefits realized in the year. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to our capital allocation on Slide 17. Nasdaq continued its track record of strong free cash flow generation with $328 million in the second quarter, representing a conversion ratio of approximately 100% over the trailing 12 months. This takes into consideration specific onetime costs associated with the Adenza acquisition and integration. This quarter, we continued to prioritize debt reduction and are ahead of our accelerated deleveraging plan. We paid down net $174 million of commercial paper and ended the quarter at 3.9 times gross leverage versus 4.1 times last quarter. This was achieved while also increasing our quarterly dividend 9% to $0.24 per share or $138 million, reflecting a 37% annualized payout ratio, and repurchasing approximately $60 million of our shares to opportunistically take advantage of the attractiveness of our stock and start to offset 2024 employee dilution. Looking ahead, we remain focused on deleveraging and expect to pay down the remaining commercial paper balance near term while remaining opportunistic and flexible. We also remain committed to offsetting employee dilution. In closing, we are thrilled with the pace at which we are delivering and the results of our integration. We are executing on our plans with focus and discipline, building a financial technology powerhouse, driving durable growth and profitability for our shareholders. Thank you for your time, and I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Thank you very much, Kyle. So we remain focused on the capital priorities that we have outlined at Investor Day. So of course, always the organic growth first and then the deleveraging remains very important. So you are right that we would start with the CP and the balance that you mentioned is approximately correct. And then after that, we would be opportunistic. We, first of all, have done about half of the employee dilution-related share repurchases. So I think you would expect us to continue to do that. And we use the word opportunistic, flexible because there are other things we could be doing, which is around either debt or equity. So what I gave is that in 2Q, it's $1 million year-on-year. And then in 3Q and after for the following three also, it would be $3 million. So you could add two on the sequential, but it's year-on-year. So $3 million year-on-year, $1 million becomes $3 million between 2Q and 3Q. Sure. So basically, what we had is really a broad momentum across our businesses, but specifically here also in the Calypso where we had one of strategic early renewal, but also 29 upsells and several new clients and so it was five new clients. And so as you look forward, you are going to continue to see solid momentum in the business. And we told you also that 2024 would remain in line with our medium-term outlook. But of course given the type of first half we have had, I think, it was not a surprise that we mentioned that we would expect more normalized growth across the products within the division versus the first half of the year. And also we pointed out consistent growth across quarters. And so this is what we said at the Capital Markets Technology revenue level. Yes. The only thing I would add is, by definition, ARR impact of a renewal is not as much as a new client or an upsell. And then so if you were focused on why we had a good performance on ARR at Calypso or in Capital Markets deck, it was really because of the breadth of everything that has happened."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. \n I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ato Garrett, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAto Garrett: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Nasdaq's First Quarter 2024 Financial Results. \n On the line are Adena Friedman, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; Sarah Youngwood, our Chief Financial Officer; John Zecca, our Chief Legal, Risk and Regulatory Officer; and other members of the management team. After prepared remarks, we will open the line for Q&A. \n The press release and earnings presentation are on our website. We intend to use the website as a means of disclosing material nonpublic information and complying with disclosure obligations under Regulation FD. \n I would like to remind you that certain statements in this presentation and during Q&A may relate to future events and expectations and constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from these projections. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ from forward-looking statements is contained in our press release and periodic reports filed with the SEC. \n Further, any references to organic growth will exclude the impact of changes in FX rates and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, which this quarter is substantially all related to AxiomSL and Calypso. The financial results of these businesses are included in Solutions revenue, within the Financial Technology division. \n Also please note that we will discuss certain financial results on a pro forma basis, which means that we are showing the results as if we've included Calypso and AxiomSL results in the first quarter 2023 and excluded the impact of changes in FX rates. Reconciliations of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP results can be found in our press release as well as in a file located in the Financials section of our Investor Relations website at ir.nasdaq.com. \n I will now turn the call over to Adena. \nAdena Friedman: Thank you, Ato. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. \n Today, my remarks will cover the following areas: our outlook on the external environment as well as highlights from our first quarter financial and operational performance, including innovation milestones and key progress updates on our cross-sell efforts and synergies. I will then turn the call over to Sarah for a review of our financial results. I'll start with our outlook on current economic environment. \n Recent data, including sustained consumer spending and labor force strength, suggests that the U.S. economy remains resilient despite heightened geopolitical risks and a higher cost of capital. The U.S. markets are generally performing well, reflecting that economic resilience as well as the potential future productivity benefits that derive from the adoption of generative AI and other sector-specific performance trends. This strength in the U.S. economy has U.S. growth projected to outpace other advanced economies. As such, economists continue to expect a soft lending in the U.S. Although other advanced economies are seeing slower growth, recent data shows improvement in manufacturing and services, particularly in Europe. \n Global inflation has trended sharply lower over the last year, although it is starting to show some signs of persistence as it moderates globally. Markets are still expecting rates to begin to decline later this year in most major markets, which will be a positive for corporates and for the real estate sector, including new homebuyers. \n With the strength of -- in the markets, we've begun to experience an uptick in IPO activity. In the first quarter, the U.S. markets welcomed 39 operating company IPOs, the most in 2 years, highlighted by 9 IPOs with market caps in excess of $1 billion. Additionally, as we referenced in our most recent Nasdaq IPO Pulse Index, we're seeing 5 out of 6 leading indicators of future IPO activity continue to improve, suggesting an improvement in the U.S. public equity capital raising environment over the coming months. \n As we look towards the remainder of the year at Nasdaq, we see a healthy pipeline of exciting companies preparing to enter the public markets. But their time lines will be dependent upon continued strong economic and market performance. \n Taking a closer look at Nasdaq's business environment, we continue to capitalize on attractive opportunities for sustainable growth through our diversified business platform that is well positioned to succeed through economic cycles, as evidenced by our solid first quarter performance with double-digit growth in our Solutions revenues. We've aligned our business against key industry-shaping megatrends, the modernization of markets, the transformation of the investment landscape, the drive towards sustainability and increasing financial services investment in resilience and risk management, where we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on strong, sustained client demand, which we'll cover throughout our call today. \n Before we move on to our financial results, I want to mention Borse Dubai's recently completed secondary offering of Nasdaq common stock. Specifically, Borse Dubai sold a position of their stake representing approximately 5% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. The secondary transaction priced on March 19 and closed on March 22, with strong investor demand resulting in an oversubscribed transaction. Following the transaction, Borse Dubai continues to hold just over 10% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. Additionally, Essa Kazim, the Chairman of Borse Dubai, will continue as a valued member of Nasdaq's Board of Directors. \n Our relationship with Borse Dubai is multifaceted, spanning many years, and Nasdaq continues to be a trusted technology provider and brand partner to Borse Dubai. We look forward to their continued support as a shareholder of Nasdaq, as their insights and contributions have and will continue to shape our path ahead. \n Turning now to our financial results. I'm pleased to share Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 with strong double-digit growth in Solutions revenues. In the first quarter, we achieved $1.1 billion in net revenues, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter on a pro forma basis. We delivered 13% pro forma revenue growth across our Solutions businesses during the quarter. In addition to strong performance across our Financial Technology division, our Index business had a stellar performance in the quarter. \n Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $2.6 billion. Across the company, we supported revenue growth and continued investments while delivering a 53% operating margin for the quarter. This represents a 1 percentage point of operating leverage against the prior year quarter both on a pro forma basis and when excluding Adenza. \n Our solid performance in the first quarter of 2024 illustrates our continued ability to execute against our strategic vision, delivering value and growth to our clients and shareholders amid a dynamic operating environment. Now let's review the highlights of our operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. \n In the Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered 15% growth highlighted by outstanding performance in our Index business. With the strong close to 2023 and subsequent market rally at the beginning of 2024, our Index business had an exceptional momentum in the first quarter. The Nasdaq-100 reached record highs multiple times during the quarter. And we are pleased to announce that our Index business overall crossed the $500 billion threshold in ETP AUM for the first time during the quarter, finishing the period at $519 billion. Over the last 12 months, we saw $46 billion of net inflows, including $21 billion just this quarter alone. We also worked with clients to launch 29 new products tracking Nasdaq indices, demonstrating our steadfast focus on innovation and global distribution. \n This momentum contributed to our Index business delivering 53% growth, which represents 38% year-over-year core revenue growth in the quarter as well as a onetime item that Sarah will describe. This quarter also marked the 25th anniversary of the Invesco QQQ ETF, representing more than 2 decades of providing investors with access to some of the world's most innovative companies within our Nasdaq-100 index. In addition to this milestone, we were honored to be named the Index Provider of the Year by etf.com, which further validates our efforts to improve investor outcomes through product introductions, innovation, performance and support. \n Our Data and Listings business was up 1% year-over-year, as global growth in our data business was offset by headwinds from delistings and a muted IPO environment. In the first quarter, our U.S. listings business achieved a 69% win rate when considering Nasdaq-eligible operating company listings. In total, we welcomed 22 operating company IPOs, raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, including Kaspi.kz, Astera Labs and BrightSpring Health. In addition, 4 companies, representing $9 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the quarter, including SAIC. \n In our data business, we continue to make progress with the signing of new customers to enterprise agreements, with additional growth driven by our international expansion strategy, reflecting the importance of creating a frictionless data experience with multiple delivery capabilities for our global client base. \n Turning to our Workflow and Insights business, which grew 4% year-over-year. We saw continued weakness in Corporate Solutions as lower sales in 2023 will continue to have an impact on our financial performance in 2024. While our sales cycles have been starting to improve over the last 6 months, they continue to be meaningfully longer than what we experienced in 2021 and the first half of 2022. \n New sales are also impacted by a persistent lower -- slower IPO environment. We are generally able to demonstrate the value of our IR and ESG solutions beyond the complementary IPO package to newly listed companies once they've had a few months to experience the rigor of the public markets. While we're encouraged by the early signs of an improving IPO environment, any IPO market improvements that we may experience in the coming quarters will take time to translate into improving sales and revenue results for our Corporate Solutions business. \n In our Analytics business, we achieved high single-digit growth in the quarter. And we continued to deepen our strategic alliance with Mercer, one of the largest global investment consultants. During the quarter, Mercer incorporated our new eVestment ESG Analytics for asset manager diligence and insights into their assessment process. We're excited about this expansion and see additional opportunity to deepen and expand our partnerships with the asset management community going forward. \n Across both Analytics and Corporate Solutions, our proprietary data remains a strategic differentiator. For example, in Analytics, we continue to develop innovative data products in our Data Link offerings that are attractive to traders and the investment community. And we have solid growth in our Market Lens product offered through our eVestment platform. \n We're also focused on enhancing our products through the use of AI. In Corporate Solutions, we're advancing Nasdaq Boardvantage with AI-powered workflow tools and are collaborating with Microsoft's ICONIC AI Incubation Lab on a series of planned AI-enabled features. As part of this partnership, we're launching a new capability that creates executive summaries for Board members and supports corporate secretaries in preparing and summarizing Board documents. We're currently testing this feature with clients in a beta release. \n Turning next to the Financial Technology division. We delivered 10% growth in the quarter. Overall, we're encouraged with the very strong client response and engagement across the new division, which further reinforces our view that our clients are looking for strategic partners that can help them navigate the complexities across the financial system and operate more efficiently. \n As part of the transition of the Calypso and AxiomSL businesses to Nasdaq, we hosted our first-ever Financial Technology conference in New York City earlier this month. The event brought together more than 170 clients from over 80 accounts. Feedback from the clients was positive, highlighting their belief that Nasdaq is the right owner and a trusted partner that will invest in the Calypso and Axiom offerings to fuel both the next wave of modernization and help them mitigate, manage and capitalize on today's environment. Through the event, clients were educated on the Nasdaq organization, the product road map strategy for the AxiomSL and Calypso offerings and on Nasdaq's comprehensive suite of solutions. This has created new commercial conversations that the team is currently pursuing. \n Now let's turn to our performance highlights, starting with the Financial Crime Management Technology business, where we achieved 23% revenue growth and 24.5% ARR growth over the prior year quarter. We advanced our leadership position among small- and medium-sized financial institutions, signing 28 new clients during the quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is our biggest bookings quarter each year, and we have a strong pipeline of sales targets to execute on as we progress through the year. \n We also continue to fight -- to advance our fight against financial crime with the full production launch of our first -- of the first of our AI copilot tools that we're calling Entity Research Copilot. This tool, which is offered through the Bedrock platform at AWS, offers -- fully automates workflows with generative AI to improve investigator efficiency. By automating tasks related to research, summarization and documentation, Verafin offers significant efficiency gains that allow banks to scale their crime-fighting efforts without increasing headcount and enables them to shift resources and investment to higher-value activities and more complex investigations. \n We're encouraged by early user results, which showed these enhanced solutions -- through these enhanced solutions, Verafin delivers up to a 90% reduction in alert review time for investigators compared to legacy approaches. We rolled out this new capability in Verafin through a beta program in the second half of last year, and we announced this week that we're moving to full production and rolling out availability to all of our bank clients. \n Next, I'll discuss the Capital Markets Technology, which is comprised of our trade management services, market technology and Calypso businesses. Overall, Capital Markets Technology grew 6% year-over-year, with 9% growth in ARR. Calypso had a particularly strong performance, with total revenues and ARR growth both demonstrating strength in client demand for our solutions. Calypso had 25 upsells and 1 new client sale during the quarter. While we're early in our journey of unlocking the cross-sell opportunities across the division, we executed on an opportunity with a client who was looking to adopt a data connector between Calypso and AxiomSL, which highlights the synergies between these 2 products. \n Now market technology had a more challenging quarter, largely due to a tough comparable quarter in 2023. We experienced solid growth in ARR but a decline in revenue from professional services primarily because of a significant delivery fee that we received in the first quarter of 2023. Within market technology, we accelerated our strategy to modernize markets by bringing leading technologies to our customers. We signed agreements to upgrade 3 matching engine clients to our next-generation platform during the quarter, and we launched a large global clearing and custody provider to the Nasdaq risk platform. \n Let's turn now to our Regulatory Technology business, which is comprised of our AxiomSL and surveillance businesses where we delivered 11% growth. Our AxiomSL business experienced strong sales and renewals throughout the first quarter. The product had 20 upsells during the quarter and 1 new client sale. With the upsells, we had 3 new ESG sales to G-SIB clients. In our surveillance business, we had 26 upsells and 5 new client sales during the quarter. Across the business, we saw continued cloud adoption, with 55% of total NTS clients now in the cloud at the end of the first quarter, which represents an increase from the end of last year. \n As we reflect on the Financial Technology division's first full quarter, we're very pleased with our financial and operational performance. We delivered revenue growth in line with the medium-term outlook that we announced at Investor Day, with strength across many areas of business as well as continued innovation in our product offerings. \n Since the formation of the Financial Technology division, we've executed on 6 cross-sells, including 1 this quarter, highlighting the strength of our One Nasdaq go-to-market approach. In addition, we have multiple cross-sell campaigns underway, and we're pleased with the growing share of cross-sell opportunities within our pipeline. As such, we're showing early progress towards our 2027 $100 million-plus cross-sell target. \n Moving to Market Services, where we're navigating a complex market backdrop, particularly against a strong 2023 first quarter comp, we're experiencing 9% decline in revenue. The U.S. options business had a lower-revenue quarter due to lower volatility compared to the prior year quarter, which included turbulence in the banking system as well as increased competition in U.S. options from new entrants and shifts in retail activity resulting from the lower-volatility profile. Despite these headwinds, Nasdaq maintained its market share lead over the #2 operator in U.S. multi-listed equity options. And our proprietary U.S. index options products, notably NDX, continued to gain strength with record revenues, volume and share. \n In the Nasdaq Stock Market, we're also pleased to confirm the launch of Dynamic M-ELO, which commenced its rollout across symbols on April 15, with the rollout scheduled to be completed by mid-May. As we've discussed previously, Dynamic M-ELO is the first SEC-approved AI-powered order type designed to improve fill rates and create greater efficiency for our investors. In Europe, where overall market liquidity continues to be challenged, we were able to maintain strong share and capture across our equities, derivatives and fixed income markets as we continue to add value to our clients through our data analytics and new trading products. \n We also continue to advance our efforts to bring transparency to nascent markets. Early in the second quarter, Puro.earth released a new report tracking the rapid expansion of global carbon removal markets over the last -- over the past years. With Puro.earth as well as our carbon market technology, we experienced strong growth in volumes and revenues as the market continues to mature with greater supply coming online. And we remained well positioned to capitalize on growing demand for carbon removal credits by bringing much-needed transparency, standardization and registry services to this emerging space. \n As we move forward, we are focused on retaining our leading market position across all of our markets and continue to build on the strong growth that we've seen in our proprietary NDX options products and in Puro.earth. \n To wrap up, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of solid results that were in line with the medium-term outlook we provided at Investor Day. In Nasdaq's core businesses, we delivered well in what we can control within a tougher market environment, including a continued muted IPO environment and lower market volatility. \n Across our Solutions businesses, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, including strong Financial Technology results and exceptional Index performance. Within Financial Technology, our recent acquisitions of AxiomSL and Calypso as well as Verafin continue to progress well and remain in line with expectations. \n With our top line performance, combined with continued expense discipline, we maintain our exceptional margin profile for the company. All told, our performance underscores the durability of our business model and our ability to deliver growth across uncertain environments. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details. \nSarah Youngwood: Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. \n Turning to our financials. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. And year-on-year growth rates and operating margins will be provided on a pro forma basis unless noted. You can find all the same metrics on an organic basis throughout the earnings presentation. \n Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $871 million up 13%. Operating expense was $524 million, up 5%, resulting in an operating margin of 53%, up 1 percentage point and with EBITDA margin at 56%. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.63. \n Turning to Slide 11 with pro forma revenue growth of 7% for the quarter. As you can see in the last bar of the chart, results included a $16 million onetime revenue benefit related to a legal settlement within Index tied to the recoupment of revenue. Excluding this, total net revenue increased 6%. And on a net basis, the 6% was alpha performance. \n Overall, beta factors were neutral this quarter, with Index market performance primarily offset by the impacts of delisting in Capital Access Platforms and lower volumes in Market Services. The 6% of alpha included 5% growth from our existing clients and a strong 3% from new clients, cross-sell and other product innovations, with churn at a low 1% level and a 1% decrease from market share and capture in Market Services. \n Turning to Slide 12. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 7%. As you recall, ARR excludes most of Index. We had 12% growth in fin tech, with strong contributions from each of the 3 subdivisions, and 1% growth in Capital Access Platforms, with strength in Analytics partially offset by the impacts of delisting, the slower IPO environment and related slower sales in Corporate Solutions. Annualized SaaS revenue totaled $932 million, up 16%. SaaS was 36% of ARR, up 3 points on a pro forma basis. \n Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In Capital Access Platforms, we delivered revenue of $479 million, reflecting growth of 15%, or 12% excluding the onetime benefit I mentioned. Index revenue increased by 53%, or 38% excluding the onetime benefit. We achieved record highs in ETP AUM, averaging $492 billion during the quarter, which is roughly $150 billion higher than the prior year period average. This includes strong market performance as well as higher futures trading volume and capture. Importantly, we also had net inflows of $46 billion in the last 12 months, including $21 billion this quarter. This performance is the result of strength of our data, brand and the relevant and innovative products we have launched over many years. \n Licensing revenue for futures and options contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 index also had high-teens growth reflecting higher futures and options trading volumes, up 5%, driven by growth in micro Nasdaq-100 futures contracts as well as the positive impact from higher capture rates of our partners. \n Moving to Data and Listings, where revenue was up 1%. Within listings, the benefit of 2023 IPOs and pricing was offset by the $10 million impact of last year's delistings and downgrades. The roll-off of prior year's initial listings revenue didn't have a material impact this quarter but will increase during the year. Within data, we continue to see global expansion driven by international demand, mostly offset by normal levels of [ pie share ]. \n Workflow and Insights revenue increased 4%. Within this, Analytics grew high single digits, reflecting our continued ability to monetize the value of our data across the investment management and trading community. Our proprietary data is key to our alpha generation throughout Nasdaq. And within Analytics, we provide valuable client insights through eVestment and Data Link. \n The strength in Analytics was partially offset by Corporate Solutions, which was flat in the period. As we continue to see elongated sales cycles at levels comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as fewer sales opportunities due to the challenging listing environment. \n In total, ARR for Capital Access Platforms was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 1%, with alpha growth from pricing, upsells and new clients mostly offset by delistings and the continued impact of slower sales cycle among our corporate clients. The division's operating margin was 58% for the quarter. Excluding the onetime benefit, the margin was 57%, up 3 percentage points. The increase was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by inflation and growth-oriented investments. \n Looking forward to the full year 2024 revenue. Due to the market backdrop negatively impacting Corporate Solutions, we expect growth in Workflow and Insights to be below its medium-term outlook, whereas the strength in our Index business gives us confidence that, within 2024, we can perform above our medium-term outlook. Taken together, we continue to expect our 2024 performance to be within the overall revenue outlook for the Capital Access Platforms division. \n Moving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. As a reminder, last week, we provided 2023 quarterly information for AxiomSL and Calypso, and today, we provided quarterly pro forma divisional results for 2023, both of which can be found in the appendix of the presentation. This should help you incorporate pro forma comparison in your model. \n The division delivered revenue of $392 million for the quarter, up 10%, in line with our medium-term outlook. The growth reflects strong performance in financial crime management, Calypso and AxiomSL at 23%, 23% and 15%, respectively, with strong client engagement. This was partially offset by a tough comp in market tech due to a significant professional service delivery in the prior year quarter, which we noted at that time, and makes the year-on-year comparison less meaningful. \n ARR was $1.4 billion, up 12%, with all subdivisions contributing to this strong growth. The key contributors to the difference between total revenue growth and ARR growth were lower year-on-year professional service revenue growth due to the tough comp for market tech as well as less-robust project delivery across our products in the quarter, partially offset by upfront revenue from on-prem renewals, particularly for Calypso. \n Before we move to subdivision results, a few words on the strong performance of AxiomSL and Calypso. Combined revenue of $151 million increased 20% versus last year, with good client momentum. We had a high level of upfront renewal revenue. We also had higher cloud-based revenues and slightly lower professional services revenue. \n As we look forward, we continue to expect combined AxiomSL and Calypso revenue to be in line with the full year expectations provided at Investor Day. As we progress through the quarters, we will provide some context to support your modeling. On the back of a strong first quarter, which delivered revenue growth above alpha trends, we expect lower revenue growth in the second quarter, due in large part to the timing of renewal. \n Combined AxiomSL and Calypso ARR of $473 million was up 15%, or up 16% excluding the impact of a significant 2023 bankruptcy noted last quarter. This is in line with our full year expectations as provided at Investor Day, and we maintain this outlook for the year. \n Moving to the subdivisions results. Financial Crime Management Technology revenue was $64 million, up 23%, with ARR of $243 million up 24.5%, reflecting continuous penetration of the core SMB client base, adding 28 new clients in the quarter, with full year 2024 SMB client wins expected to be at least that of 2023. While we had no new Tier 1 or 2 bank signings in the quarter, we continued to have active and positive engagement with a strong pipeline of client opportunities which we expect to sign in the coming quarters. \n Regulatory Technology revenue was $90 million, and ARR was $328 million, both up 11%. Excluding the impact of churn related to the liquidity event of March 2023, revenue and ARR were up 12% and 13%, respectively. Surveillance grew 6% for both revenue and ARR, reflecting strong sales as well as the continuation of the cloud transformation of this business, with 55% of Nasdaq Trade Surveillance customers now in the cloud. \n AxiomSL grew revenue 15% and ARR by 16%, reflecting strong sales. In the quarter, nearly 50% of new bookings were in the cloud, highlighting the continued cloud journey for the business that is ultimately beneficial for both our clients and Nasdaq. \n In Capital Markets Technology, we delivered revenue of $238 million, up 6%, with ARR of $821 million up 9%. Calypso had a strong quarter, with revenue up 23% and ARR up 14%. Revenue included a strong contribution of on-prem renewal revenue. The business had 16% of new bookings come from the cloud, a lower proportion than what we expect for the year due to timing. \n The combined market tech and trade management services business, which is what we used to call marketplace tech, was slightly down in revenue but up in ARR, again driven by the significant professional service delivery in the prior year period that provided a tough comp. This impact was somewhat offset by the partial quarter impact of pricing increases coupled with strong client activity and testing revenue within trade management services. Looking forward to the full year 2024, we expect the combined market tech and trade management services to be well positioned within the 3% to 5% range, with a muted second quarter and the growth being back ended. \n The division's operating margin in the first quarter was 45%, up 2 percentage points. The margin expansion reflects strong top line revenue growth and the beginning of synergy realization, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and expense related to revenue and investments in growth. \n And wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $237 million for the quarter, down 9% versus an extremely tough comp. The first story here is 1 percentage point or $3 million relating to our share of nonrecurring industry adjustments to the tape plan. The rest was about half beta, half alpha, with beta drivers across tape, 1 fewer trading day and volumes in Europe; and most of the alpha story tied to last year's exceptional capture in our U.S. options business during the bank liquidity events in the first quarter. $0.13 per contract traded in 1Q '23 was an exception in a consistent 2-year trend of capture at $0.12, which is where we were in the first quarter. \n The division's operating margin of 56% in the first quarter represents a 6 percentage points decrease from the prior year period as a result of lower revenue as well as ongoing investments related to both capacity enhancements and modernizing our market. \n Turning to Slide 16. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $524 million, reflecting pro forma growth of $24 million or 5%. This is driven by inflation, supporting our revenue growth and investments. This compares to pro forma revenue growth of $76 million or 7%, reflecting positive operating leverage. \n Now on to guidance. We are updating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $2.125 billion to $2.185 billion to reflect FX, equity compensation and less uncertainty on revenue growth. The midpoint represents pro forma growth of just over 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza, FX and the in-year benefits of net expense synergies. Excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth would be around 4.5%. In addition, the second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. And therefore, we expect expense to increase just under $20 million from the first quarter of 2024, assuming stable performance and exchange rates. \n On synergies, we have actioned approximately 40% of our $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 1Q '24, with the P&L benefit weighted towards the second half of 2024 and into 2025 given some transition projects. We are confident in the 70% actioned by the end of 2024 and would note that it won't be linear. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. \n Turning to Slide 17. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. In the quarter, we had $504 million of free cash flow. Please note that cash flow generation in the first quarter is generally elevated versus the rest of the year. Once again, we had a cash flow conversion ratio above 100% at 106% for the last 12 months. \n In terms of free cash flow utilization in the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, or $127 million, for a 35% payout ratio. And we did not repurchase any shares this quarter. We also repaid the remaining $340 million of our term loan, in line with our prior commitment of prioritizing deleveraging. And finally, we repaid $67 million of commercial paper. Excluding commercial paper, all of our outstanding debt is now fixed. Our all-in pretax cost of debt was 4.0% as we exit 1Q '24. \n Turning to leverage. Our gross leverage ratio declined from 4.3 at the end of last year to 4.1 at the end of 1Q '24. In addition to the stated debt repayments, our leverage ratio decreased 0.1x from impacts of FX, amortization of debt issue costs and stronger EBITDA. We are reiterating our expectation to achieve gross leverage below 4x, 9 to 12 months ahead of our initial goal. \n As I reflect on this quarter, I would highlight strong client adoption and growth in Solutions overall and particularly in Index, Analytics, financial crime management, AxiomSL and Calypso; strong progress on synergy actions and building of cross-sell pipelines; and continued actions on deleveraging. As we look ahead, I continue to be impressed by the balance and diversity of the business model, enabling us to grow the top line with strong margins and to effectively execute our capital allocation plans. We are well positioned to deliver on our One Nasdaq strategy and achieve durable organic revenue growth and profitability. \n Thank you for your time. And I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer. \nKwun Sum Lau: Could you please add more color on the cross-sell campaigns to achieve your $100 million target? What is the plan for the rest of this year? Does it mainly cover the cross-sell within Adenza or between Adenza and Verafin or across the whole company? \nAdena Friedman: Thanks, Owen. Sure. So we actually described the current cross-sell campaigns at Investor Day a few weeks ago, and it really covers across the fin tech division. So one of the cross-sell campaigns is really focusing on bringing more of the Calypso risk management, collateral management capabilities into our market operator clients. \n Another one actually is working with the Calypso clients to bring more AxiomSL capabilities, so bringing AxiomSL into some of the capital markets firms where they have new regulatory obligations that they're facing. \n And then the third is introducing some of the Verafin clients to the AxiomSL team as well and the Calypso team, particularly actually on the treasury management capabilities within Calypso, that we think are relevant to the Tier 3 banks that we -- that are really a big part of the Verafin client base. \n So those are the 3 main campaigns we have, but I would tell you it is actually really interesting as we talk to our bank clients, our broker-dealer clients, our exchange clients. When we have conversations today, it generally will start with one product and then move to a second. I was actually talking to one client just the other day, where they're an AxiomSL client and they're really interested in anti-fin crime. So we can kind of look holistically at the strategic relationship in ways that we haven't been able to do in the past. So it's been a great start, and we hope to be able to show some tangible progress. It will take time for these opportunities to turn into contracts. As you know, it takes time to contract with banks, but we are very encouraged by the early conversations we're having. \nKwun Sum Lau: Got it. That's helpful. Just a quick follow-up on Verafin. I think you didn't sign Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks this quarter, but the number was still pretty strong. Can you please talk about the pipeline for the rest of this year for Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks and also give us an update on the international expansion opportunity? \nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, sure. So you're right. We didn't sign any new clients, but we are working really well and implementing the clients we signed last year. And that's going quite well. And we have a lot -- a very, very good pipeline of companies either that we're in the middle of doing proofs of concepts for or we're in the middle of contracting. And so we do feel very good about our ability to continue to sign those clients as we proceed through the year. And it's interesting. \n So the challenges that we're really focused on that we bring to the clients -- usually the first way to get in the door at least is through the fraud detection and investigative capabilities because it's just such an easy and clear return on invested -- investment that we can show them in terms of reducing false positives and increasing fraud found. \n Another area of focus right now for a lot of the bigger banks is check fraud, and we have a new check fraud capability that we're rolling out that we think is really best in class. And we're really excited on our engagement there. And then with our new -- our entity research and copilot tool, that really supports our anti-money laundering capabilities. And with a 90% reduction in investigative time, we actually think that could be a really great way for us to engage with larger banks, in addition, of course, to our entire clientele. \n In terms of the international expansion, we're focused, I think we've mentioned at Investor Day, primarily on Canada and the U.K. And some of those are progressing quite along, and some of them are still very early conversations. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: So maybe starting with Adenza as well. Really strong year-over-year growth you pointed out, about 20%. And it sounds like a lot of it is coming on the Calypso side, so can you kind of help us bridge the sources of growth, particularly at Calypso and, as you think on the forward, how you see that opportunity unfold for Calypso specifically over the course of this year and into next? \nAdena Friedman: Sure. Thanks, Alex. Actually I'll go -- I'll cover Calypso and AxiomSL together, so -- I mean each of them. But I think Sarah did a really nice job of laying out the growth for each of the products as well as combined. And what you're seeing is some of it is timing of renewals. So we did have a really good renewal quarter for Calypso and AxiomSL but particularly at Calypso with more of the on-prem deliveries, so our on-prem renewals, which you know is a good revenue driver for us in terms of how we recognize the license fees. \n But if you look at just ARR growth, which is really kind of takes out some of that onetime benefit and just looks overall at the strength of the platform, they're both growing in the mid-teens ARR growth. And I think that that's just showing strong demand across the clientele for Calypso. It's risk management, treasury risk management, capital risk management. And I think that they're -- that's a big, big focus of banks. And we still are in that sweet spot of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 banks that we can sign across the world. \n I think with AxiomSL, it's all about new regulation, and so we have the ESG modules that we sold into the G-SIBs, so it's really interesting. We're definitely making progress on signing around the Basel requirements and other new regulations that are coming. And so I would have to say it's a pretty consistent demand cycle for both products, and we -- and we're -- it's been great. I mean the clients are really excited to work with us. \n As well as also talking about like that one connector, that one client that did connector between Calypso and AxiomSL, what that means is they're already a Calypso client. They know they have new regulation. Instead of having to like create a whole new data integration for AxiomSL, we're able to take the data from the Calypso and automatically imported into AxiomSL, and that lowers the time to market for us to implement the Axiom products and obviously makes the Axiom product more appealing. So pretty excited about what we're doing across both products this year. \nAlexander Blostein: Great. And then my second question is just around the market tech business. You flagged that you signed agreement to upgrade a number of clients, I think you said 3, to a new matching engine next-gen platform. Can you help us maybe contextualize what that means in terms of revenues? Is it stronger revenue? Is there any sort of installation fee upfront, profitability of those platforms? If there's any -- any meat around the bone would be great. \nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure, yes. So I think, when we sign new clients to the next-gen system, whether it's trading or clearing, we do have implementation revenue, and now we're calling that professional services revenue that comes in as we work through the implementation. We'd start to receive the license revenue upon delivery, so that's a little bit of a difference between Calypso, Axiom versus market tech. \n But what we're finding is, when we work with them on the next-gen systems, first of all, it allows them to have flexibility to consider cloud for the first time, right? So markets both on trading and on clearing settlement, it allows them to start to understand that they can deliver these and start to operate in cloud, which would increase our share of wallet if that's the way they choose to go, but even without that, we do have some opportunity to upsell them on the renewal because it's really world-class technology and also provide them additional services. \n So for an example, with one client that we're working with, they also are taking risk management capabilities, which is cloud delivered, as well as market operations capabilities, which are cloud delivered, so we have an ability to actually continue to upsell them on other components of what it means to run a market. And those are all cloud delivered, so they're much easier for us to implement for them. And that's the way that we're working with these -- our market tech clients to continue to get a bigger share of their spend while also giving them more value and modernizing their business. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: I wanted to follow up on capital access. You talked about some pickup in listings but clearly still slower than we've seen previously in previous years, but curious about the revenue impacts. I think you mentioned still some flow-through of the delistings that occurred, so wondering how we should think about the revenue progression this year. And then also tying that to Workflow and Insights, it sounds like any rebound or recovery in that segment is also tied to a pickup in listings. So just curious about the outlook there and what really will get that business kind of accelerating growth. \nAdena Friedman: Sure. I'm going to hand the first part of the question over to Sarah. And I'll talk about Corporate Solutions. \nSarah Youngwood: Yes. So what you're looking at in Data and Listings and listings, in particular, is that we are coming into the year, and that's what we've discussed for a while at this point, with some headwinds. And in particular, I gave you the $10 million for the delistings of last year and the downgrades. And so that's the impact for 1 quarter. \n And so you have that as well as I also mentioned that, as you go into the year, we're going to start seeing the effect of the costs of 2021 not being as well replaced by the following [ classes ]. So the amortization of the initial listing fees is also a headwind, not so much for this quarter but for the rest of the year. So you start with that. And of course, you have -- offsetting that is some benefits of [ right ] pricing as well as the new IPOs, but this is a lot of headwinds to offset. \n So this is the context there. So the IPO environment would certainly help if it came in the second half, but it's a slow-moving machine where you will have that amortized. And therefore, it's hard to offset those delisting fees, which are the full impact. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. So that -- I think we started to talk about that towards the end of last year, but I think it's important to recognize, as Sarah said, it's a slow-moving train in terms of both the impact of the delisting environment but then also the impact of an improving IPO environment. \n Now how that parlays into corporate services, one of the things that we've talked about over the last several years -- and it's kind of the flywheel effect of having -- when we have an active IPO environment, we get more companies to come into the market. They start to understand the needs for their investor relations capabilities. They want to modernize their governance and ESG reporting for their clients. And they start to look not only at the IPO package we give them but other upsells and capabilities we can offer them. And that's a positive flywheel. Now in a tougher environment where we have companies delisted but also fewer new customers to sell to, that's also having kind of the flip effect on market -- or on the Corporate Solutions business, so we want to make sure you're -- you guys understand those dynamics. \n When we think about Corporate Solutions overall, and we've had this business for a long time, we've kind of described it as kind of a business that has, I would say, kind of low to mid-single-digit type of growth environment, as a general matter, when markets are normalized. And this isn't necessarily a totally normalized environment. \n So we're wanting to give you those -- that context, so you think about that -- what that means for the overall Workflow and Insights business. And that's why Sarah shared with you kind of our full year view of that business, as compared to outlook, versus the Index business, of course, where we're having a very strong start to the year. And we anticipate that, that would be -- that would come in above our outlook for the year. \nDaniel Fannon: Great. That's helpful. And then I guess, just on the Index business, based upon quarter-to-date or year-to-date activity, is -- can you give us a sense of when the tiering might occur with the pricing with CME based on where things sit now? \nAdena Friedman: I mean that generally occurs in the second quarter. I don't think that we have a precise answer to that, but it generally occurs in the second quarter. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Michael Cho from JPMorgan. \nY. Cho: I just wanted to touch on Axiom and Calypso as well. I mean it looks like each of that ARR trends are healthy. And clearly the increase in subscription revenues are helping that growth this quarter. I guess can you just help us unpack a little bit about how much price and upsells was a driver here in terms of that revenue growth and how that mix might change in the coming years? And is there a different approach to that when we think about Axiom versus Calypso? Because clearly they serve different markets and different solutions. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. So I think that I would say, first of all, as we said before, we have about -- half the revenue increases tend to come from upsells. And half come from pricing changes and new sells -- sales. We don't try to break that out further than that. And I think that's generally the case. I don't know if it's precisely the case for this quarter, but that's the general way that we consider the revenue growth. \n In terms of how that might change over time, I think that really has more to do with as we continue to roll out the cloud capabilities for our clients because that gives us a chance to do more for the client and, therefore, get a higher value for our solutions. And so that creates a pricing lever for us, but that's because we're providing more value. So as we continue to progress with the cloud and new bookings in cloud -- as you saw with Axiom, we had 50% of new bookings in cloud. We were a little slower this quarter on Calypso, but that's kind of more of a timing thing. \n I think that we believe that, that will continue to progress our ability to have that as a pricing lever but also make it so that the revenue is more stable over time. You have more predictable revenue streams in the years ahead, but we are in that transition period, so that transition period creates the ability for -- and we want to make sure we're giving you color on this on-prem versus cloud so that you can kind of work with us through that transition period to those benefits from cloud over time. \nY. Cho: Great. And then just a quick follow-up on marketplace tech. I think I heard, Sarah, you say the 3% to 5% for 2024 in terms of revenues. I just want to make sure I caught that right. And two, what's the driver there in terms of the back half loaded in terms of the revenue growth? \nSarah Youngwood: Yes. So you heard me well that we would be well positioned within the 3% to 5% range there. And I did say a muted second quarter and the fourth being back ended. \n And I think Adena wanted to comment on that. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. I just want to say we have some deliveries that we're delivering kind of partway through the year. That, obviously, has been turned on the license revenues, and so that can help. And then we feel that we have a good pipeline of growth and new clients so that we'll be able to deliver growth as we go through the year, but we feel very good about -- as you said, it's within the range, and I think you said strong within the range. \nSarah Youngwood: Yes. And I would just add also that the project delivery, which was a tough comp, it was really a tough comp in the first quarter but also a bit in the second quarter. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: We had a question on index options with NDX. How can you tap into the growing popularity with index options just given your strong brand with the Nasdaq-100 index? I think your share of index options is only about 1%, but the growth rates are high, and the revenue capture is very attractive in this business. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. Thanks, Craig. Yes, you're right. So we have a great opportunity there, and we've been putting a lot of focus on that. It's been a good collaboration between our index team and the options team, so we -- what's nice is we have all of that within Nasdaq. So together, they're working on building a really good, robust trading ecosystem for the NDX options platform, as well as building on an institutional demand for our index products, which then drives interest in hedging and other things that would then drive interest in the index options. \n So it's definitely kind of taking hold. I think we had a really strong uptick in volumes in the index options year-over-year. It was like 80% increase and then a, like, 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in the volumes in the index options. So it's -- that's definitely been a really great bright spot. And we agree. We're just at the beginning of what we can achieve there. \nCraig Siegenthaler: And just for my follow-up, it's on the comparison between ARR and revenues given the growing focus you have on ARR. As you move into more subscription and reoccurring businesses, should we see more of a delta between these 2 metrics on a quarterly basis? \nAdena Friedman: I would actually say that, as we move more towards cloud, there should be less of a delta, but that's a long transition. I think we have to recognize that, for the AxiomSL, Calypso and market tech businesses, those are still primarily an on-prem delivered solution with transitions to cloud, whereas for the financial crime management business it's entirely cloud, as well as NTS now. That's a SaaS business. So the majority of those revenues, you'll see more of a -- the ARR looking closer to total revenue. \n So that delta, I would say, will persist for a while, but we're trying to give you enough transparency so that you can understand the difference and you understand the trends that are driving the differences. But when we look at our business, we say, what's the underlying health of our business, we are focusing on ARR. And that, to us, is a better reflection of the overall client demand, as opposed to like individual deliveries and professional services. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: Just following up on that last question from Craig, is there anything you can share about sort of the upcoming pipeline in 2024 in terms of on-prem versus cloud implementations? Just I know you're kind of guiding and talking about the business on an ARR basis, but just as we think about our models, is there anything specific we can think about quarter by quarter? \nAdena Friedman: Quarter by quarter, I think we're not going to provide that level of detail. I would say, if we look over the last year and we kind of looked at Calypso and AxiomSL over the last year, I think it was around 40%. Is that right? 40% new bookings? \nSarah Youngwood: Yes, yes. Almost half. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. So almost half of the new bookings were cloud last year. I think that, as we were starting this year, we saw 50% of the new bookings for AxiomSL were cloud this year and with Calypso being lower around 18%, but as we said before, it's more of a timing issue. So we would hope that we would get around the same level over the course of the year, but we're not able to provide you kind of quarter by quarter. I think we just are giving you a little bit more overall color for the quarter in AxiomSL and Calypso just to help you model but not to that level of precision. \nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Understood. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the IPO win rate. Just Q1 looks a little bit lower than what you reported in the past, but is that sort of just a function of the quarter itself? And based on the pipeline for the rest of the year, do you have any expectations on should that sort of trend back upwards? What are your thoughts there? \nAdena Friedman: Yes, sure, yes. So I think every quarter is a little bit of a different story and based on the nature of the companies that are going public, but our overall view is that we have a great, strong pipeline. We have a great platform. We're very confident in our ability to keep our win rate high. And we're really excited about the companies that are looking to go public in the next -- hopefully, in the next quarters. And also -- I would also mention that, over the last year, our win rate was 80%. So we have to look at it a little bit over a longer period of time, but we have 80 companies in the pipeline to go public on Nasdaq. And we're really hopeful that they feel good about being able to tap the markets in the coming quarters. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. \nSimon Alistair Clinch: I was wondering if you could -- just going back to the cross-selling opportunities. At the Investor Day, you mentioned you're sort of starting to build an enterprise sales team. That's something relatively new to the Nasdaq story, as I understand. I was wondering if you could update us on how that's progressing. Are you -- have you already built it? Is this now a fully functioning team and driving the cross-sells? Or is that momentum still to come? And I have a follow-up. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. Actually we had -- just had a meeting about it across the management committee last week, where we talked about how we're going to approach enterprise sales and making sure that we have -- across Nasdaq, we have a good connective tissue to make sure that we can deliver for the enterprises. And we're doing a lot in blocking and tackling. \n So first is making sure we have kind of an enterprise sales organization. The second thing is we're doing a lot in the data management of our client data to make sure we can look at our client data across the franchise and be able to have line of sight across the franchise so that we can actually talk to the clients on an enterprise basis. And then in terms of the sales commissions to the way that our price sales team works with the product sales teams, we've designed a commission plan around that, that I think really helps drive behaviors and alignment. \n So that's -- all of that is actually -- just so you know that enterprise sales team is being built within fin tech, but the collaboration across the fin tech division and the cap division and Market Services is really, really strong. And we hope to be able to demonstrate really good strength there and -- going forward. That's a big part of our ability to achieve the cross-sell target, but we definitely have made a lot of progress already. \nSimon Alistair Clinch: Okay. That's great. And then I think, just lastly, I was wondering if you could perhaps expand a little bit more on the very strong flows we've had in the Index business and, in particular, interest outside of the Nasdaq-100 franchise. I mean could you give us a little bit more detail about that and just how to think about the momentum and sustainability? \nAdena Friedman: Yes. So you're right. So we've given a stat at Investor Day that I think is worth mentioning. So about 70% of our revenue comes from the Nasdaq-100 franchise, but another 30% comes from other indices that we have in terms of innovative indexes around AI, cloud and cyber as well as momentum and other factor indices that we have around the world. So it actually is a pretty diversified platform. \n And in terms of the inflows, it's pretty mixed, meaning that it's coming from all of our Index products, with probably strength coming in on some of the innovation indexes, the Nasdaq-100 as well and on global distribution. So we've definitely been really focused on globalizing the distribution of our products and bringing in investment and inflows across the world. So those are probably the ones that are getting the most inflows, but it isn't just the Nasdaq-100. \n And what's really interesting is it's been very consistent. Whether or not the markets are up or down, we're seeing inflows. And so I think that that's also showing that investors are kind of seeing through a quarter and reflecting on the future of the economy, and they want to be a part of that. So that's what we're seeing in terms of inflows. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. \nKyle Voigt: Maybe just a couple of follow-ups. So first is a follow-up on Dan's earlier question on the Workflow and Insights business. It still sounds like the Analytics business is posting high single-digit solid growth. I think the Corporate Solutions, that likely imply is kind of flattish. And you noted the elongated sales cycles. I guess can you just talk about the average sales cycle for that business and kind of the lag time that you'd expect between when the IPO environment ramps and when you ultimately expect to see an acceleration in revenues in that Corporate Solutions business? \nAdena Friedman: I think that the reason why we wanted to give you that level of disclosure this quarter is just to help you understand kind of how we see the year. I think that as -- if the IPO environment ramps up, and that's -- it's an if, we've -- and obviously it's a when at some point, but in terms of looking at it within the year, if we see improvement there, we tend to have, I would say, probably on average kind of a 6-month sales cycle would probably be a good average, around maybe 4 to 6 months in terms of an average on sales cycle for clients. \n But I -- so -- but then, of course, they also have to understand what -- that they need the product. So if they go public, they start to recognize that they really want more intelligence about their investors. They really want to make sure they have the right ESG reporting. And they start to work with us more holistically kind of as they season. And then there, I would say maybe like sometimes it can be a very quick sales cycle, but we'll say like 4 to 6 months is a general view, so you're talking about more going into 2025 to start to see momentum if we have a recovery in the IPO environment. \nKyle Voigt: That makes sense. And then just a follow-up on kind of capital priorities. It sounds like, over the near term, #1 priority still remains deleveraging. I guess with the Thoma Bravo unlock coming later this quarter, can you just talk about any willingness to restart buybacks or start to deploy some capital towards buybacks this quarter? Or should we really expect that to be 100% allocated towards deleveraging near term? \nSarah Youngwood: Thanks, Kyle. So in terms of the capital prioritization, we're super consistent with what we said at the Investor Day. We were really glad to be able to pay down the term loan this quarter and to end the quarter at 4.1. We are totally committed to all of the time lines that we have given at Investor Day. So the 9 to 12 months ahead, you can consider that to be something that we will deliver. \n And within that, we're keeping some flexibility to consider share repurchases if it makes sense. And that would be, in particular, related to the employee issuance. So offsetting the issuance, we think, is important, but when we look at it comprehensively, we are very, very focused on the deleveraging, in particular, because when you look at the EPS acquisition dilution, given some of the higher debt costs that we can repay even at our current stock price, it's still a really attractive proposition to do that. And of course, the cash flow accretion is something that we are focused on, too. \nOperator: And I show our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: Maybe just moving over to Verafin, continued strong growth in new SaaS clients. And then just trying to get a sense of what that might mean for the cadence of revenue growth in that segment as we move throughout the year, if you think that can improve from the 23% level, already pretty strong. And then the rollout of the Entity Research Copilot is -- just your thoughts on how that might contribute to revenue progress throughout the year in that segment. \nAdena Friedman: Sure. Yes, we're not going to provide you specific kind of views of the revenue growth other than we say that it's mid-20s. And we feel good about the overall outlook there. I think that as -- with the copilot capability, the way that we're rolling out copilot would be the same that we're rolling out any new module that we provide to our small to medium bank clients. So when a small and medium bank client signs up for Verafin, they sign up for the platform. And we then introduce new modules into that platform -- or new capabilities into that platform through their contract period. And then at the end of the contract period, we walk through with them what's the return that we've offered them through that period and, therefore, what would be the price increase that we think is appropriate for the value that we're providing to them. \n So as we roll out the copilot capabilities and we get usage across the platform, across the banks, it will help us show a really strong ROI for them so that in our renewal talks, it becomes a part of that conversation. But it's not a module that we're selling discretely to them. We want them to use it. We want them to integrate it into workflows. And we want them -- we want this product to be as sticky as possible and as valuable as possible, so -- for the renewal conversations. \n As we look upmarket into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, where it's all new sales and where we're selling modules, so as we go in and talk to them, are -- the modules that are the most straightforward to sell across our platform are the fraud modules because it's a very clear calculus of return to them. But as you talk about AML, it's a much more complicated problem. And now we have this new tool that we can offer through our AML solution that shows a clear return. So in addition to doing a great job of rooting out criminal behaviors and money laundering, we also can show them we're going to save them a ton of time and resources on the investigative side of it. And so we do think it will help us with sales. It will help us show value to the platform. And we can look at that as part of the pricing that we discussed with them when we signed them. So that's basically how we're using this tool to kind of drive sales retention and upsells. \nOperator: And I show our last question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. \nMichael Cyprys: Just wanted to ask about the Adenza business now that it's been about 6 months or so since close. Just curious, in conversations with clients of Calypso and Axiom, where you see the strongest moat across their business and capabilities? And where is there room for you to improve the moat as you kind of look out over the next couple of years? \nAdena Friedman: Yes. I'd say, first of all, one of the really big -- let's start with AxiomSL. One of their strongest elements is that they're completely global. They connect into over 100 regulators and across more than 50 countries. And so when they're talking to a bank that has any business in any country, they can say, \"Look, not only can we solve the problems within country, but we can help you with your entire global business and all the regulatory reporting needs.\" \n It also -- it's a machine. Like it's an amazing team of people. They have the regulatory expertise. And so when -- as soon as a new rule is even introduced or contemplated, they're already writing the requirements to bring that into the tool, so we're ahead of the rules every time a new rule comes out with a new module. And I -- it's interesting also. There's obviously a lot of new regulation coming, but we just, I think, do a great job of providing a very elegant way to ingest their data, deliver solutions, make it really efficient and on a global basis. \n Now when it comes to Calypso, I think that, what we're finding -- there are 2 elements at Calypso that are just like world class, best in class. One of them is our collateral management capability. It's just excellent. And so we can walk in and show that we can really make them much more efficient managing their collateral, which then gives them better ability to drive liquidity across their franchise. It frees up capital. \n The second thing is kind of clearing risk management, trading risk management so that, again, they can unlock liquidity and unlock capital for the use in the markets. \n And then the third is on the treasury side. That's been a fast grower both on the brokerage businesses but also buy side. So any active trading buy-side client, the treasury tool has been a really good growth area for us. \n So I think those are the areas where we just feel like we're kind of -- we're best in class. And that drives a lot of great conversations with the clients. \nMichael Cyprys: Great. And just a follow-up question. I was hoping you maybe could elaborate a little bit on the new product road map strategy for Axiom and Calypso as you look out for the rest of this year. \nAdena Friedman: Yes. So well, first of all, we are in a kind of what I would call an upgrade cycle for Calypso. So we have a new version that we're rolling out. And we're working to make sure we get all of our clients onto that version this year. So that's driving renewal activity. \n I think that -- but more generally, we have also -- the Basel III and Basel IV end game is a driver of revenue growth and demand. And clients are really talking about it more as a when and how big, as opposed to if. And so I think that customers who are forward leaning are already signing with us to make sure that they're entirely ready. And with this Calypso-Axiom data transfer capability, we're also working with some of our Axiom clients on some Calypso capabilities that help them manage their capital more efficiently while they're managing their regulatory needs because that's going to be a big element of focus for the regulators. \n So I have to say I do feel like those are the areas where we're seeing a product road map in year. Multiyear product road map is about making sure we continue to modernize the cloud-delivered solutions, make sure that we can do that super efficiently for them. We have more data -- modern data management capabilities that allow us to unlock more functionality within the platforms and make the products even more valuable to them. \nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back to Adena Friedman, Chair and CEO, for closing remarks. \nAdena Friedman: Great. Well, thank you very much. \n So as you heard throughout the meeting, Nasdaq continues to make progress on our 3 key priorities: Integrate, Innovate, and Accelerate, which will underpin our leadership and momentum as we move through the year. United behind these strategic priorities and powered by our market-leading platforms, we're firmly positioned to unlock our next phase of resilient and scalable growth. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year. \n Thank you all very much, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Adena Friedman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ato. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. \n Today, my remarks will cover the following areas: our outlook on the external environment as well as highlights from our first quarter financial and operational performance, including innovation milestones and key progress updates on our cross-sell efforts and synergies. I will then turn the call over to Sarah for a review of our financial results. I'll start with our outlook on current economic environment. \n Recent data, including sustained consumer spending and labor force strength, suggests that the U.S. economy remains resilient despite heightened geopolitical risks and a higher cost of capital. The U.S. markets are generally performing well, reflecting that economic resilience as well as the potential future productivity benefits that derive from the adoption of generative AI and other sector-specific performance trends. This strength in the U.S. economy has U.S. growth projected to outpace other advanced economies. As such, economists continue to expect a soft lending in the U.S. Although other advanced economies are seeing slower growth, recent data shows improvement in manufacturing and services, particularly in Europe. \n Global inflation has trended sharply lower over the last year, although it is starting to show some signs of persistence as it moderates globally. Markets are still expecting rates to begin to decline later this year in most major markets, which will be a positive for corporates and for the real estate sector, including new homebuyers. \n With the strength of -- in the markets, we've begun to experience an uptick in IPO activity. In the first quarter, the U.S. markets welcomed 39 operating company IPOs, the most in 2 years, highlighted by 9 IPOs with market caps in excess of $1 billion. Additionally, as we referenced in our most recent Nasdaq IPO Pulse Index, we're seeing 5 out of 6 leading indicators of future IPO activity continue to improve, suggesting an improvement in the U.S. public equity capital raising environment over the coming months. \n As we look towards the remainder of the year at Nasdaq, we see a healthy pipeline of exciting companies preparing to enter the public markets. But their time lines will be dependent upon continued strong economic and market performance. \n Taking a closer look at Nasdaq's business environment, we continue to capitalize on attractive opportunities for sustainable growth through our diversified business platform that is well positioned to succeed through economic cycles, as evidenced by our solid first quarter performance with double-digit growth in our Solutions revenues. We've aligned our business against key industry-shaping megatrends, the modernization of markets, the transformation of the investment landscape, the drive towards sustainability and increasing financial services investment in resilience and risk management, where we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on strong, sustained client demand, which we'll cover throughout our call today. \n Before we move on to our financial results, I want to mention Borse Dubai's recently completed secondary offering of Nasdaq common stock. Specifically, Borse Dubai sold a position of their stake representing approximately 5% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. The secondary transaction priced on March 19 and closed on March 22, with strong investor demand resulting in an oversubscribed transaction. Following the transaction, Borse Dubai continues to hold just over 10% of Nasdaq's total shares outstanding. Additionally, Essa Kazim, the Chairman of Borse Dubai, will continue as a valued member of Nasdaq's Board of Directors. \n Our relationship with Borse Dubai is multifaceted, spanning many years, and Nasdaq continues to be a trusted technology provider and brand partner to Borse Dubai. We look forward to their continued support as a shareholder of Nasdaq, as their insights and contributions have and will continue to shape our path ahead. \n Turning now to our financial results. I'm pleased to share Nasdaq's solid financial performance for the first quarter of 2024 with strong double-digit growth in Solutions revenues. In the first quarter, we achieved $1.1 billion in net revenues, an increase of 7% compared to the prior year quarter on a pro forma basis. We delivered 13% pro forma revenue growth across our Solutions businesses during the quarter. In addition to strong performance across our Financial Technology division, our Index business had a stellar performance in the quarter. \n Our annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, increased 7% year-over-year on a pro forma basis to $2.6 billion. Across the company, we supported revenue growth and continued investments while delivering a 53% operating margin for the quarter. This represents a 1 percentage point of operating leverage against the prior year quarter both on a pro forma basis and when excluding Adenza. \n Our solid performance in the first quarter of 2024 illustrates our continued ability to execute against our strategic vision, delivering value and growth to our clients and shareholders amid a dynamic operating environment. Now let's review the highlights of our operational accomplishments and client successes by division, starting with Capital Access Platforms. \n In the Capital Access Platforms division, we delivered 15% growth highlighted by outstanding performance in our Index business. With the strong close to 2023 and subsequent market rally at the beginning of 2024, our Index business had an exceptional momentum in the first quarter. The Nasdaq-100 reached record highs multiple times during the quarter. And we are pleased to announce that our Index business overall crossed the $500 billion threshold in ETP AUM for the first time during the quarter, finishing the period at $519 billion. Over the last 12 months, we saw $46 billion of net inflows, including $21 billion just this quarter alone. We also worked with clients to launch 29 new products tracking Nasdaq indices, demonstrating our steadfast focus on innovation and global distribution. \n This momentum contributed to our Index business delivering 53% growth, which represents 38% year-over-year core revenue growth in the quarter as well as a onetime item that Sarah will describe. This quarter also marked the 25th anniversary of the Invesco QQQ ETF, representing more than 2 decades of providing investors with access to some of the world's most innovative companies within our Nasdaq-100 index. In addition to this milestone, we were honored to be named the Index Provider of the Year by etf.com, which further validates our efforts to improve investor outcomes through product introductions, innovation, performance and support. \n Our Data and Listings business was up 1% year-over-year, as global growth in our data business was offset by headwinds from delistings and a muted IPO environment. In the first quarter, our U.S. listings business achieved a 69% win rate when considering Nasdaq-eligible operating company listings. In total, we welcomed 22 operating company IPOs, raising nearly $4 billion in proceeds, including Kaspi.kz, Astera Labs and BrightSpring Health. In addition, 4 companies, representing $9 billion in market value switched their listings to Nasdaq during the quarter, including SAIC. \n In our data business, we continue to make progress with the signing of new customers to enterprise agreements, with additional growth driven by our international expansion strategy, reflecting the importance of creating a frictionless data experience with multiple delivery capabilities for our global client base. \n Turning to our Workflow and Insights business, which grew 4% year-over-year. We saw continued weakness in Corporate Solutions as lower sales in 2023 will continue to have an impact on our financial performance in 2024. While our sales cycles have been starting to improve over the last 6 months, they continue to be meaningfully longer than what we experienced in 2021 and the first half of 2022. \n New sales are also impacted by a persistent lower -- slower IPO environment. We are generally able to demonstrate the value of our IR and ESG solutions beyond the complementary IPO package to newly listed companies once they've had a few months to experience the rigor of the public markets. While we're encouraged by the early signs of an improving IPO environment, any IPO market improvements that we may experience in the coming quarters will take time to translate into improving sales and revenue results for our Corporate Solutions business. \n In our Analytics business, we achieved high single-digit growth in the quarter. And we continued to deepen our strategic alliance with Mercer, one of the largest global investment consultants. During the quarter, Mercer incorporated our new eVestment ESG Analytics for asset manager diligence and insights into their assessment process. We're excited about this expansion and see additional opportunity to deepen and expand our partnerships with the asset management community going forward. \n Across both Analytics and Corporate Solutions, our proprietary data remains a strategic differentiator. For example, in Analytics, we continue to develop innovative data products in our Data Link offerings that are attractive to traders and the investment community. And we have solid growth in our Market Lens product offered through our eVestment platform. \n We're also focused on enhancing our products through the use of AI. In Corporate Solutions, we're advancing Nasdaq Boardvantage with AI-powered workflow tools and are collaborating with Microsoft's ICONIC AI Incubation Lab on a series of planned AI-enabled features. As part of this partnership, we're launching a new capability that creates executive summaries for Board members and supports corporate secretaries in preparing and summarizing Board documents. We're currently testing this feature with clients in a beta release. \n Turning next to the Financial Technology division. We delivered 10% growth in the quarter. Overall, we're encouraged with the very strong client response and engagement across the new division, which further reinforces our view that our clients are looking for strategic partners that can help them navigate the complexities across the financial system and operate more efficiently. \n As part of the transition of the Calypso and AxiomSL businesses to Nasdaq, we hosted our first-ever Financial Technology conference in New York City earlier this month. The event brought together more than 170 clients from over 80 accounts. Feedback from the clients was positive, highlighting their belief that Nasdaq is the right owner and a trusted partner that will invest in the Calypso and Axiom offerings to fuel both the next wave of modernization and help them mitigate, manage and capitalize on today's environment. Through the event, clients were educated on the Nasdaq organization, the product road map strategy for the AxiomSL and Calypso offerings and on Nasdaq's comprehensive suite of solutions. This has created new commercial conversations that the team is currently pursuing. \n Now let's turn to our performance highlights, starting with the Financial Crime Management Technology business, where we achieved 23% revenue growth and 24.5% ARR growth over the prior year quarter. We advanced our leadership position among small- and medium-sized financial institutions, signing 28 new clients during the quarter. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is our biggest bookings quarter each year, and we have a strong pipeline of sales targets to execute on as we progress through the year. \n We also continue to fight -- to advance our fight against financial crime with the full production launch of our first -- of the first of our AI copilot tools that we're calling Entity Research Copilot. This tool, which is offered through the Bedrock platform at AWS, offers -- fully automates workflows with generative AI to improve investigator efficiency. By automating tasks related to research, summarization and documentation, Verafin offers significant efficiency gains that allow banks to scale their crime-fighting efforts without increasing headcount and enables them to shift resources and investment to higher-value activities and more complex investigations. \n We're encouraged by early user results, which showed these enhanced solutions -- through these enhanced solutions, Verafin delivers up to a 90% reduction in alert review time for investigators compared to legacy approaches. We rolled out this new capability in Verafin through a beta program in the second half of last year, and we announced this week that we're moving to full production and rolling out availability to all of our bank clients. \n Next, I'll discuss the Capital Markets Technology, which is comprised of our trade management services, market technology and Calypso businesses. Overall, Capital Markets Technology grew 6% year-over-year, with 9% growth in ARR. Calypso had a particularly strong performance, with total revenues and ARR growth both demonstrating strength in client demand for our solutions. Calypso had 25 upsells and 1 new client sale during the quarter. While we're early in our journey of unlocking the cross-sell opportunities across the division, we executed on an opportunity with a client who was looking to adopt a data connector between Calypso and AxiomSL, which highlights the synergies between these 2 products. \n Now market technology had a more challenging quarter, largely due to a tough comparable quarter in 2023. We experienced solid growth in ARR but a decline in revenue from professional services primarily because of a significant delivery fee that we received in the first quarter of 2023. Within market technology, we accelerated our strategy to modernize markets by bringing leading technologies to our customers. We signed agreements to upgrade 3 matching engine clients to our next-generation platform during the quarter, and we launched a large global clearing and custody provider to the Nasdaq risk platform. \n Let's turn now to our Regulatory Technology business, which is comprised of our AxiomSL and surveillance businesses where we delivered 11% growth. Our AxiomSL business experienced strong sales and renewals throughout the first quarter. The product had 20 upsells during the quarter and 1 new client sale. With the upsells, we had 3 new ESG sales to G-SIB clients. In our surveillance business, we had 26 upsells and 5 new client sales during the quarter. Across the business, we saw continued cloud adoption, with 55% of total NTS clients now in the cloud at the end of the first quarter, which represents an increase from the end of last year. \n As we reflect on the Financial Technology division's first full quarter, we're very pleased with our financial and operational performance. We delivered revenue growth in line with the medium-term outlook that we announced at Investor Day, with strength across many areas of business as well as continued innovation in our product offerings. \n Since the formation of the Financial Technology division, we've executed on 6 cross-sells, including 1 this quarter, highlighting the strength of our One Nasdaq go-to-market approach. In addition, we have multiple cross-sell campaigns underway, and we're pleased with the growing share of cross-sell opportunities within our pipeline. As such, we're showing early progress towards our 2027 $100 million-plus cross-sell target. \n Moving to Market Services, where we're navigating a complex market backdrop, particularly against a strong 2023 first quarter comp, we're experiencing 9% decline in revenue. The U.S. options business had a lower-revenue quarter due to lower volatility compared to the prior year quarter, which included turbulence in the banking system as well as increased competition in U.S. options from new entrants and shifts in retail activity resulting from the lower-volatility profile. Despite these headwinds, Nasdaq maintained its market share lead over the #2 operator in U.S. multi-listed equity options. And our proprietary U.S. index options products, notably NDX, continued to gain strength with record revenues, volume and share. \n In the Nasdaq Stock Market, we're also pleased to confirm the launch of Dynamic M-ELO, which commenced its rollout across symbols on April 15, with the rollout scheduled to be completed by mid-May. As we've discussed previously, Dynamic M-ELO is the first SEC-approved AI-powered order type designed to improve fill rates and create greater efficiency for our investors. In Europe, where overall market liquidity continues to be challenged, we were able to maintain strong share and capture across our equities, derivatives and fixed income markets as we continue to add value to our clients through our data analytics and new trading products. \n We also continue to advance our efforts to bring transparency to nascent markets. Early in the second quarter, Puro.earth released a new report tracking the rapid expansion of global carbon removal markets over the last -- over the past years. With Puro.earth as well as our carbon market technology, we experienced strong growth in volumes and revenues as the market continues to mature with greater supply coming online. And we remained well positioned to capitalize on growing demand for carbon removal credits by bringing much-needed transparency, standardization and registry services to this emerging space. \n As we move forward, we are focused on retaining our leading market position across all of our markets and continue to build on the strong growth that we've seen in our proprietary NDX options products and in Puro.earth. \n To wrap up, we're pleased to deliver another quarter of solid results that were in line with the medium-term outlook we provided at Investor Day. In Nasdaq's core businesses, we delivered well in what we can control within a tougher market environment, including a continued muted IPO environment and lower market volatility. \n Across our Solutions businesses, we delivered double-digit revenue growth, including strong Financial Technology results and exceptional Index performance. Within Financial Technology, our recent acquisitions of AxiomSL and Calypso as well as Verafin continue to progress well and remain in line with expectations. \n With our top line performance, combined with continued expense discipline, we maintain our exceptional margin profile for the company. All told, our performance underscores the durability of our business model and our ability to deliver growth across uncertain environments. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Sarah to review the financial details. Thanks, Owen. Sure. So we actually described the current cross-sell campaigns at Investor Day a few weeks ago, and it really covers across the fin tech division. So one of the cross-sell campaigns is really focusing on bringing more of the Calypso risk management, collateral management capabilities into our market operator clients. \n Another one actually is working with the Calypso clients to bring more AxiomSL capabilities, so bringing AxiomSL into some of the capital markets firms where they have new regulatory obligations that they're facing. \n And then the third is introducing some of the Verafin clients to the AxiomSL team as well and the Calypso team, particularly actually on the treasury management capabilities within Calypso, that we think are relevant to the Tier 3 banks that we -- that are really a big part of the Verafin client base. \n So those are the 3 main campaigns we have, but I would tell you it is actually really interesting as we talk to our bank clients, our broker-dealer clients, our exchange clients. When we have conversations today, it generally will start with one product and then move to a second. I was actually talking to one client just the other day, where they're an AxiomSL client and they're really interested in anti-fin crime. So we can kind of look holistically at the strategic relationship in ways that we haven't been able to do in the past. So it's been a great start, and we hope to be able to show some tangible progress. It will take time for these opportunities to turn into contracts. As you know, it takes time to contract with banks, but we are very encouraged by the early conversations we're having. Sure. Yes, sure. So you're right. We didn't sign any new clients, but we are working really well and implementing the clients we signed last year. And that's going quite well. And we have a lot -- a very, very good pipeline of companies either that we're in the middle of doing proofs of concepts for or we're in the middle of contracting. And so we do feel very good about our ability to continue to sign those clients as we proceed through the year. And it's interesting. \n So the challenges that we're really focused on that we bring to the clients -- usually the first way to get in the door at least is through the fraud detection and investigative capabilities because it's just such an easy and clear return on invested -- investment that we can show them in terms of reducing false positives and increasing fraud found. \n Another area of focus right now for a lot of the bigger banks is check fraud, and we have a new check fraud capability that we're rolling out that we think is really best in class. And we're really excited on our engagement there. And then with our new -- our entity research and copilot tool, that really supports our anti-money laundering capabilities. And with a 90% reduction in investigative time, we actually think that could be a really great way for us to engage with larger banks, in addition, of course, to our entire clientele. \n In terms of the international expansion, we're focused, I think we've mentioned at Investor Day, primarily on Canada and the U.K. And some of those are progressing quite along, and some of them are still very early conversations. Sure. Thanks, Alex. Actually I'll go -- I'll cover Calypso and AxiomSL together, so -- I mean each of them. But I think Sarah did a really nice job of laying out the growth for each of the products as well as combined. And what you're seeing is some of it is timing of renewals. So we did have a really good renewal quarter for Calypso and AxiomSL but particularly at Calypso with more of the on-prem deliveries, so our on-prem renewals, which you know is a good revenue driver for us in terms of how we recognize the license fees. \n But if you look at just ARR growth, which is really kind of takes out some of that onetime benefit and just looks overall at the strength of the platform, they're both growing in the mid-teens ARR growth. And I think that that's just showing strong demand across the clientele for Calypso. It's risk management, treasury risk management, capital risk management. And I think that they're -- that's a big, big focus of banks. And we still are in that sweet spot of the Tier 2 and Tier 3 banks that we can sign across the world. \n I think with AxiomSL, it's all about new regulation, and so we have the ESG modules that we sold into the G-SIBs, so it's really interesting. We're definitely making progress on signing around the Basel requirements and other new regulations that are coming. And so I would have to say it's a pretty consistent demand cycle for both products, and we -- and we're -- it's been great. I mean the clients are really excited to work with us. \n As well as also talking about like that one connector, that one client that did connector between Calypso and AxiomSL, what that means is they're already a Calypso client. They know they have new regulation. Instead of having to like create a whole new data integration for AxiomSL, we're able to take the data from the Calypso and automatically imported into AxiomSL, and that lowers the time to market for us to implement the Axiom products and obviously makes the Axiom product more appealing. So pretty excited about what we're doing across both products this year. Yes, sure, yes. So I think, when we sign new clients to the next-gen system, whether it's trading or clearing, we do have implementation revenue, and now we're calling that professional services revenue that comes in as we work through the implementation. We'd start to receive the license revenue upon delivery, so that's a little bit of a difference between Calypso, Axiom versus market tech. \n But what we're finding is, when we work with them on the next-gen systems, first of all, it allows them to have flexibility to consider cloud for the first time, right? So markets both on trading and on clearing settlement, it allows them to start to understand that they can deliver these and start to operate in cloud, which would increase our share of wallet if that's the way they choose to go, but even without that, we do have some opportunity to upsell them on the renewal because it's really world-class technology and also provide them additional services. \n So for an example, with one client that we're working with, they also are taking risk management capabilities, which is cloud delivered, as well as market operations capabilities, which are cloud delivered, so we have an ability to actually continue to upsell them on other components of what it means to run a market. And those are all cloud delivered, so they're much easier for us to implement for them. And that's the way that we're working with these -- our market tech clients to continue to get a bigger share of their spend while also giving them more value and modernizing their business. Sure. I'm going to hand the first part of the question over to Sarah. And I'll talk about Corporate Solutions. Yes. So that -- I think we started to talk about that towards the end of last year, but I think it's important to recognize, as Sarah said, it's a slow-moving train in terms of both the impact of the delisting environment but then also the impact of an improving IPO environment. \n Now how that parlays into corporate services, one of the things that we've talked about over the last several years -- and it's kind of the flywheel effect of having -- when we have an active IPO environment, we get more companies to come into the market. They start to understand the needs for their investor relations capabilities. They want to modernize their governance and ESG reporting for their clients. And they start to look not only at the IPO package we give them but other upsells and capabilities we can offer them. And that's a positive flywheel. Now in a tougher environment where we have companies delisted but also fewer new customers to sell to, that's also having kind of the flip effect on market -- or on the Corporate Solutions business, so we want to make sure you're -- you guys understand those dynamics. \n When we think about Corporate Solutions overall, and we've had this business for a long time, we've kind of described it as kind of a business that has, I would say, kind of low to mid-single-digit type of growth environment, as a general matter, when markets are normalized. And this isn't necessarily a totally normalized environment. \n So we're wanting to give you those -- that context, so you think about that -- what that means for the overall Workflow and Insights business. And that's why Sarah shared with you kind of our full year view of that business, as compared to outlook, versus the Index business, of course, where we're having a very strong start to the year. And we anticipate that, that would be -- that would come in above our outlook for the year. I mean that generally occurs in the second quarter. I don't think that we have a precise answer to that, but it generally occurs in the second quarter. Yes. So I think that I would say, first of all, as we said before, we have about -- half the revenue increases tend to come from upsells. And half come from pricing changes and new sells -- sales. We don't try to break that out further than that. And I think that's generally the case. I don't know if it's precisely the case for this quarter, but that's the general way that we consider the revenue growth. \n In terms of how that might change over time, I think that really has more to do with as we continue to roll out the cloud capabilities for our clients because that gives us a chance to do more for the client and, therefore, get a higher value for our solutions. And so that creates a pricing lever for us, but that's because we're providing more value. So as we continue to progress with the cloud and new bookings in cloud -- as you saw with Axiom, we had 50% of new bookings in cloud. We were a little slower this quarter on Calypso, but that's kind of more of a timing thing. \n I think that we believe that, that will continue to progress our ability to have that as a pricing lever but also make it so that the revenue is more stable over time. You have more predictable revenue streams in the years ahead, but we are in that transition period, so that transition period creates the ability for -- and we want to make sure we're giving you color on this on-prem versus cloud so that you can kind of work with us through that transition period to those benefits from cloud over time. Yes. I just want to say we have some deliveries that we're delivering kind of partway through the year. That, obviously, has been turned on the license revenues, and so that can help. And then we feel that we have a good pipeline of growth and new clients so that we'll be able to deliver growth as we go through the year, but we feel very good about -- as you said, it's within the range, and I think you said strong within the range. Yes. Thanks, Craig. Yes, you're right. So we have a great opportunity there, and we've been putting a lot of focus on that. It's been a good collaboration between our index team and the options team, so we -- what's nice is we have all of that within Nasdaq. So together, they're working on building a really good, robust trading ecosystem for the NDX options platform, as well as building on an institutional demand for our index products, which then drives interest in hedging and other things that would then drive interest in the index options. \n So it's definitely kind of taking hold. I think we had a really strong uptick in volumes in the index options year-over-year. It was like 80% increase and then a, like, 15% quarter-over-quarter increase in the volumes in the index options. So it's -- that's definitely been a really great bright spot. And we agree. We're just at the beginning of what we can achieve there. I would actually say that, as we move more towards cloud, there should be less of a delta, but that's a long transition. I think we have to recognize that, for the AxiomSL, Calypso and market tech businesses, those are still primarily an on-prem delivered solution with transitions to cloud, whereas for the financial crime management business it's entirely cloud, as well as NTS now. That's a SaaS business. So the majority of those revenues, you'll see more of a -- the ARR looking closer to total revenue. \n So that delta, I would say, will persist for a while, but we're trying to give you enough transparency so that you can understand the difference and you understand the trends that are driving the differences. But when we look at our business, we say, what's the underlying health of our business, we are focusing on ARR. And that, to us, is a better reflection of the overall client demand, as opposed to like individual deliveries and professional services. Quarter by quarter, I think we're not going to provide that level of detail. I would say, if we look over the last year and we kind of looked at Calypso and AxiomSL over the last year, I think it was around 40%. Is that right? 40% new bookings? Yes. So almost half of the new bookings were cloud last year. I think that, as we were starting this year, we saw 50% of the new bookings for AxiomSL were cloud this year and with Calypso being lower around 18%, but as we said before, it's more of a timing issue. So we would hope that we would get around the same level over the course of the year, but we're not able to provide you kind of quarter by quarter. I think we just are giving you a little bit more overall color for the quarter in AxiomSL and Calypso just to help you model but not to that level of precision. Yes, sure, yes. So I think every quarter is a little bit of a different story and based on the nature of the companies that are going public, but our overall view is that we have a great, strong pipeline. We have a great platform. We're very confident in our ability to keep our win rate high. And we're really excited about the companies that are looking to go public in the next -- hopefully, in the next quarters. And also -- I would also mention that, over the last year, our win rate was 80%. So we have to look at it a little bit over a longer period of time, but we have 80 companies in the pipeline to go public on Nasdaq. And we're really hopeful that they feel good about being able to tap the markets in the coming quarters. Yes. Actually we had -- just had a meeting about it across the management committee last week, where we talked about how we're going to approach enterprise sales and making sure that we have -- across Nasdaq, we have a good connective tissue to make sure that we can deliver for the enterprises. And we're doing a lot in blocking and tackling. \n So first is making sure we have kind of an enterprise sales organization. The second thing is we're doing a lot in the data management of our client data to make sure we can look at our client data across the franchise and be able to have line of sight across the franchise so that we can actually talk to the clients on an enterprise basis. And then in terms of the sales commissions to the way that our price sales team works with the product sales teams, we've designed a commission plan around that, that I think really helps drive behaviors and alignment. \n So that's -- all of that is actually -- just so you know that enterprise sales team is being built within fin tech, but the collaboration across the fin tech division and the cap division and Market Services is really, really strong. And we hope to be able to demonstrate really good strength there and -- going forward. That's a big part of our ability to achieve the cross-sell target, but we definitely have made a lot of progress already. Yes. So you're right. So we've given a stat at Investor Day that I think is worth mentioning. So about 70% of our revenue comes from the Nasdaq-100 franchise, but another 30% comes from other indices that we have in terms of innovative indexes around AI, cloud and cyber as well as momentum and other factor indices that we have around the world. So it actually is a pretty diversified platform. \n And in terms of the inflows, it's pretty mixed, meaning that it's coming from all of our Index products, with probably strength coming in on some of the innovation indexes, the Nasdaq-100 as well and on global distribution. So we've definitely been really focused on globalizing the distribution of our products and bringing in investment and inflows across the world. So those are probably the ones that are getting the most inflows, but it isn't just the Nasdaq-100. \n And what's really interesting is it's been very consistent. Whether or not the markets are up or down, we're seeing inflows. And so I think that that's also showing that investors are kind of seeing through a quarter and reflecting on the future of the economy, and they want to be a part of that. So that's what we're seeing in terms of inflows. I think that the reason why we wanted to give you that level of disclosure this quarter is just to help you understand kind of how we see the year. I think that as -- if the IPO environment ramps up, and that's -- it's an if, we've -- and obviously it's a when at some point, but in terms of looking at it within the year, if we see improvement there, we tend to have, I would say, probably on average kind of a 6-month sales cycle would probably be a good average, around maybe 4 to 6 months in terms of an average on sales cycle for clients. \n But I -- so -- but then, of course, they also have to understand what -- that they need the product. So if they go public, they start to recognize that they really want more intelligence about their investors. They really want to make sure they have the right ESG reporting. And they start to work with us more holistically kind of as they season. And then there, I would say maybe like sometimes it can be a very quick sales cycle, but we'll say like 4 to 6 months is a general view, so you're talking about more going into 2025 to start to see momentum if we have a recovery in the IPO environment. Sure. Yes, we're not going to provide you specific kind of views of the revenue growth other than we say that it's mid-20s. And we feel good about the overall outlook there. I think that as -- with the copilot capability, the way that we're rolling out copilot would be the same that we're rolling out any new module that we provide to our small to medium bank clients. So when a small and medium bank client signs up for Verafin, they sign up for the platform. And we then introduce new modules into that platform -- or new capabilities into that platform through their contract period. And then at the end of the contract period, we walk through with them what's the return that we've offered them through that period and, therefore, what would be the price increase that we think is appropriate for the value that we're providing to them. \n So as we roll out the copilot capabilities and we get usage across the platform, across the banks, it will help us show a really strong ROI for them so that in our renewal talks, it becomes a part of that conversation. But it's not a module that we're selling discretely to them. We want them to use it. We want them to integrate it into workflows. And we want them -- we want this product to be as sticky as possible and as valuable as possible, so -- for the renewal conversations. \n As we look upmarket into the Tier 1 and Tier 2 banks, where it's all new sales and where we're selling modules, so as we go in and talk to them, are -- the modules that are the most straightforward to sell across our platform are the fraud modules because it's a very clear calculus of return to them. But as you talk about AML, it's a much more complicated problem. And now we have this new tool that we can offer through our AML solution that shows a clear return. So in addition to doing a great job of rooting out criminal behaviors and money laundering, we also can show them we're going to save them a ton of time and resources on the investigative side of it. And so we do think it will help us with sales. It will help us show value to the platform. And we can look at that as part of the pricing that we discussed with them when we signed them. So that's basically how we're using this tool to kind of drive sales retention and upsells. Yes. I'd say, first of all, one of the really big -- let's start with AxiomSL. One of their strongest elements is that they're completely global. They connect into over 100 regulators and across more than 50 countries. And so when they're talking to a bank that has any business in any country, they can say, \"Look, not only can we solve the problems within country, but we can help you with your entire global business and all the regulatory reporting needs.\" \n It also -- it's a machine. Like it's an amazing team of people. They have the regulatory expertise. And so when -- as soon as a new rule is even introduced or contemplated, they're already writing the requirements to bring that into the tool, so we're ahead of the rules every time a new rule comes out with a new module. And I -- it's interesting also. There's obviously a lot of new regulation coming, but we just, I think, do a great job of providing a very elegant way to ingest their data, deliver solutions, make it really efficient and on a global basis. \n Now when it comes to Calypso, I think that, what we're finding -- there are 2 elements at Calypso that are just like world class, best in class. One of them is our collateral management capability. It's just excellent. And so we can walk in and show that we can really make them much more efficient managing their collateral, which then gives them better ability to drive liquidity across their franchise. It frees up capital. \n The second thing is kind of clearing risk management, trading risk management so that, again, they can unlock liquidity and unlock capital for the use in the markets. \n And then the third is on the treasury side. That's been a fast grower both on the brokerage businesses but also buy side. So any active trading buy-side client, the treasury tool has been a really good growth area for us. \n So I think those are the areas where we just feel like we're kind of -- we're best in class. And that drives a lot of great conversations with the clients. Yes. So well, first of all, we are in a kind of what I would call an upgrade cycle for Calypso. So we have a new version that we're rolling out. And we're working to make sure we get all of our clients onto that version this year. So that's driving renewal activity. \n I think that -- but more generally, we have also -- the Basel III and Basel IV end game is a driver of revenue growth and demand. And clients are really talking about it more as a when and how big, as opposed to if. And so I think that customers who are forward leaning are already signing with us to make sure that they're entirely ready. And with this Calypso-Axiom data transfer capability, we're also working with some of our Axiom clients on some Calypso capabilities that help them manage their capital more efficiently while they're managing their regulatory needs because that's going to be a big element of focus for the regulators. \n So I have to say I do feel like those are the areas where we're seeing a product road map in year. Multiyear product road map is about making sure we continue to modernize the cloud-delivered solutions, make sure that we can do that super efficiently for them. We have more data -- modern data management capabilities that allow us to unlock more functionality within the platforms and make the products even more valuable to them. Great. Well, thank you very much. \n So as you heard throughout the meeting, Nasdaq continues to make progress on our 3 key priorities: Integrate, Innovate, and Accelerate, which will underpin our leadership and momentum as we move through the year. United behind these strategic priorities and powered by our market-leading platforms, we're firmly positioned to unlock our next phase of resilient and scalable growth. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress throughout the year. \n Thank you all very much, and have a great day."

            "name": "Sarah Youngwood",
            "content": "Thank you, Adena. And good morning, everyone. \n Turning to our financials. My commentary will focus on non-GAAP results. And year-on-year growth rates and operating margins will be provided on a pro forma basis unless noted. You can find all the same metrics on an organic basis throughout the earnings presentation. \n Turning to our first quarter results on Slide 10. We reported net revenue of $1.1 billion, up 7%, with Solutions revenue of $871 million up 13%. Operating expense was $524 million, up 5%, resulting in an operating margin of 53%, up 1 percentage point and with EBITDA margin at 56%. Overall, this resulted in diluted EPS of $0.63. \n Turning to Slide 11 with pro forma revenue growth of 7% for the quarter. As you can see in the last bar of the chart, results included a $16 million onetime revenue benefit related to a legal settlement within Index tied to the recoupment of revenue. Excluding this, total net revenue increased 6%. And on a net basis, the 6% was alpha performance. \n Overall, beta factors were neutral this quarter, with Index market performance primarily offset by the impacts of delisting in Capital Access Platforms and lower volumes in Market Services. The 6% of alpha included 5% growth from our existing clients and a strong 3% from new clients, cross-sell and other product innovations, with churn at a low 1% level and a 1% decrease from market share and capture in Market Services. \n Turning to Slide 12. ARR totaled $2.6 billion, up 7%. As you recall, ARR excludes most of Index. We had 12% growth in fin tech, with strong contributions from each of the 3 subdivisions, and 1% growth in Capital Access Platforms, with strength in Analytics partially offset by the impacts of delisting, the slower IPO environment and related slower sales in Corporate Solutions. Annualized SaaS revenue totaled $932 million, up 16%. SaaS was 36% of ARR, up 3 points on a pro forma basis. \n Let's review division results for the quarter, starting on Slide 13. In Capital Access Platforms, we delivered revenue of $479 million, reflecting growth of 15%, or 12% excluding the onetime benefit I mentioned. Index revenue increased by 53%, or 38% excluding the onetime benefit. We achieved record highs in ETP AUM, averaging $492 billion during the quarter, which is roughly $150 billion higher than the prior year period average. This includes strong market performance as well as higher futures trading volume and capture. Importantly, we also had net inflows of $46 billion in the last 12 months, including $21 billion this quarter. This performance is the result of strength of our data, brand and the relevant and innovative products we have launched over many years. \n Licensing revenue for futures and options contracts linked to the Nasdaq-100 index also had high-teens growth reflecting higher futures and options trading volumes, up 5%, driven by growth in micro Nasdaq-100 futures contracts as well as the positive impact from higher capture rates of our partners. \n Moving to Data and Listings, where revenue was up 1%. Within listings, the benefit of 2023 IPOs and pricing was offset by the $10 million impact of last year's delistings and downgrades. The roll-off of prior year's initial listings revenue didn't have a material impact this quarter but will increase during the year. Within data, we continue to see global expansion driven by international demand, mostly offset by normal levels of [ pie share ]. \n Workflow and Insights revenue increased 4%. Within this, Analytics grew high single digits, reflecting our continued ability to monetize the value of our data across the investment management and trading community. Our proprietary data is key to our alpha generation throughout Nasdaq. And within Analytics, we provide valuable client insights through eVestment and Data Link. \n The strength in Analytics was partially offset by Corporate Solutions, which was flat in the period. As we continue to see elongated sales cycles at levels comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023 as well as fewer sales opportunities due to the challenging listing environment. \n In total, ARR for Capital Access Platforms was $1.2 billion for the quarter, up 1%, with alpha growth from pricing, upsells and new clients mostly offset by delistings and the continued impact of slower sales cycle among our corporate clients. The division's operating margin was 58% for the quarter. Excluding the onetime benefit, the margin was 57%, up 3 percentage points. The increase was driven by higher revenue, partially offset by inflation and growth-oriented investments. \n Looking forward to the full year 2024 revenue. Due to the market backdrop negatively impacting Corporate Solutions, we expect growth in Workflow and Insights to be below its medium-term outlook, whereas the strength in our Index business gives us confidence that, within 2024, we can perform above our medium-term outlook. Taken together, we continue to expect our 2024 performance to be within the overall revenue outlook for the Capital Access Platforms division. \n Moving to Financial Technology on Slide 14. As a reminder, last week, we provided 2023 quarterly information for AxiomSL and Calypso, and today, we provided quarterly pro forma divisional results for 2023, both of which can be found in the appendix of the presentation. This should help you incorporate pro forma comparison in your model. \n The division delivered revenue of $392 million for the quarter, up 10%, in line with our medium-term outlook. The growth reflects strong performance in financial crime management, Calypso and AxiomSL at 23%, 23% and 15%, respectively, with strong client engagement. This was partially offset by a tough comp in market tech due to a significant professional service delivery in the prior year quarter, which we noted at that time, and makes the year-on-year comparison less meaningful. \n ARR was $1.4 billion, up 12%, with all subdivisions contributing to this strong growth. The key contributors to the difference between total revenue growth and ARR growth were lower year-on-year professional service revenue growth due to the tough comp for market tech as well as less-robust project delivery across our products in the quarter, partially offset by upfront revenue from on-prem renewals, particularly for Calypso. \n Before we move to subdivision results, a few words on the strong performance of AxiomSL and Calypso. Combined revenue of $151 million increased 20% versus last year, with good client momentum. We had a high level of upfront renewal revenue. We also had higher cloud-based revenues and slightly lower professional services revenue. \n As we look forward, we continue to expect combined AxiomSL and Calypso revenue to be in line with the full year expectations provided at Investor Day. As we progress through the quarters, we will provide some context to support your modeling. On the back of a strong first quarter, which delivered revenue growth above alpha trends, we expect lower revenue growth in the second quarter, due in large part to the timing of renewal. \n Combined AxiomSL and Calypso ARR of $473 million was up 15%, or up 16% excluding the impact of a significant 2023 bankruptcy noted last quarter. This is in line with our full year expectations as provided at Investor Day, and we maintain this outlook for the year. \n Moving to the subdivisions results. Financial Crime Management Technology revenue was $64 million, up 23%, with ARR of $243 million up 24.5%, reflecting continuous penetration of the core SMB client base, adding 28 new clients in the quarter, with full year 2024 SMB client wins expected to be at least that of 2023. While we had no new Tier 1 or 2 bank signings in the quarter, we continued to have active and positive engagement with a strong pipeline of client opportunities which we expect to sign in the coming quarters. \n Regulatory Technology revenue was $90 million, and ARR was $328 million, both up 11%. Excluding the impact of churn related to the liquidity event of March 2023, revenue and ARR were up 12% and 13%, respectively. Surveillance grew 6% for both revenue and ARR, reflecting strong sales as well as the continuation of the cloud transformation of this business, with 55% of Nasdaq Trade Surveillance customers now in the cloud. \n AxiomSL grew revenue 15% and ARR by 16%, reflecting strong sales. In the quarter, nearly 50% of new bookings were in the cloud, highlighting the continued cloud journey for the business that is ultimately beneficial for both our clients and Nasdaq. \n In Capital Markets Technology, we delivered revenue of $238 million, up 6%, with ARR of $821 million up 9%. Calypso had a strong quarter, with revenue up 23% and ARR up 14%. Revenue included a strong contribution of on-prem renewal revenue. The business had 16% of new bookings come from the cloud, a lower proportion than what we expect for the year due to timing. \n The combined market tech and trade management services business, which is what we used to call marketplace tech, was slightly down in revenue but up in ARR, again driven by the significant professional service delivery in the prior year period that provided a tough comp. This impact was somewhat offset by the partial quarter impact of pricing increases coupled with strong client activity and testing revenue within trade management services. Looking forward to the full year 2024, we expect the combined market tech and trade management services to be well positioned within the 3% to 5% range, with a muted second quarter and the growth being back ended. \n The division's operating margin in the first quarter was 45%, up 2 percentage points. The margin expansion reflects strong top line revenue growth and the beginning of synergy realization, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits expense and expense related to revenue and investments in growth. \n And wrapping up the divisions with Market Services. Net revenue was $237 million for the quarter, down 9% versus an extremely tough comp. The first story here is 1 percentage point or $3 million relating to our share of nonrecurring industry adjustments to the tape plan. The rest was about half beta, half alpha, with beta drivers across tape, 1 fewer trading day and volumes in Europe; and most of the alpha story tied to last year's exceptional capture in our U.S. options business during the bank liquidity events in the first quarter. $0.13 per contract traded in 1Q '23 was an exception in a consistent 2-year trend of capture at $0.12, which is where we were in the first quarter. \n The division's operating margin of 56% in the first quarter represents a 6 percentage points decrease from the prior year period as a result of lower revenue as well as ongoing investments related to both capacity enhancements and modernizing our market. \n Turning to Slide 16. This quarter's non-GAAP operating expense was $524 million, reflecting pro forma growth of $24 million or 5%. This is driven by inflation, supporting our revenue growth and investments. This compares to pro forma revenue growth of $76 million or 7%, reflecting positive operating leverage. \n Now on to guidance. We are updating 2024 non-GAAP operating expense guidance to $2.125 billion to $2.185 billion to reflect FX, equity compensation and less uncertainty on revenue growth. The midpoint represents pro forma growth of just over 5%. This includes a full year of Adenza, FX and the in-year benefits of net expense synergies. Excluding Adenza, Nasdaq's expense growth would be around 4.5%. In addition, the second quarter will reflect our annual merit adjustments and equity grants. And therefore, we expect expense to increase just under $20 million from the first quarter of 2024, assuming stable performance and exchange rates. \n On synergies, we have actioned approximately 40% of our $80 million of net expense synergies through the end of 1Q '24, with the P&L benefit weighted towards the second half of 2024 and into 2025 given some transition projects. We are confident in the 70% actioned by the end of 2024 and would note that it won't be linear. Additionally, we continue to expect a full year tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% on a non-GAAP basis. \n Turning to Slide 17. Strong free cash flow continues to be the hallmark of Nasdaq. In the quarter, we had $504 million of free cash flow. Please note that cash flow generation in the first quarter is generally elevated versus the rest of the year. Once again, we had a cash flow conversion ratio above 100% at 106% for the last 12 months. \n In terms of free cash flow utilization in the quarter, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, or $127 million, for a 35% payout ratio. And we did not repurchase any shares this quarter. We also repaid the remaining $340 million of our term loan, in line with our prior commitment of prioritizing deleveraging. And finally, we repaid $67 million of commercial paper. Excluding commercial paper, all of our outstanding debt is now fixed. Our all-in pretax cost of debt was 4.0% as we exit 1Q '24. \n Turning to leverage. Our gross leverage ratio declined from 4.3 at the end of last year to 4.1 at the end of 1Q '24. In addition to the stated debt repayments, our leverage ratio decreased 0.1x from impacts of FX, amortization of debt issue costs and stronger EBITDA. We are reiterating our expectation to achieve gross leverage below 4x, 9 to 12 months ahead of our initial goal. \n As I reflect on this quarter, I would highlight strong client adoption and growth in Solutions overall and particularly in Index, Analytics, financial crime management, AxiomSL and Calypso; strong progress on synergy actions and building of cross-sell pipelines; and continued actions on deleveraging. As we look ahead, I continue to be impressed by the balance and diversity of the business model, enabling us to grow the top line with strong margins and to effectively execute our capital allocation plans. We are well positioned to deliver on our One Nasdaq strategy and achieve durable organic revenue growth and profitability. \n Thank you for your time. And I will turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes. So what you're looking at in Data and Listings and listings, in particular, is that we are coming into the year, and that's what we've discussed for a while at this point, with some headwinds. And in particular, I gave you the $10 million for the delistings of last year and the downgrades. And so that's the impact for 1 quarter. \n And so you have that as well as I also mentioned that, as you go into the year, we're going to start seeing the effect of the costs of 2021 not being as well replaced by the following [ classes ]. So the amortization of the initial listing fees is also a headwind, not so much for this quarter but for the rest of the year. So you start with that. And of course, you have -- offsetting that is some benefits of [ right ] pricing as well as the new IPOs, but this is a lot of headwinds to offset. \n So this is the context there. So the IPO environment would certainly help if it came in the second half, but it's a slow-moving machine where you will have that amortized. And therefore, it's hard to offset those delisting fees, which are the full impact. Yes. So you heard me well that we would be well positioned within the 3% to 5% range there. And I did say a muted second quarter and the fourth being back ended. \n And I think Adena wanted to comment on that. Yes. And I would just add also that the project delivery, which was a tough comp, it was really a tough comp in the first quarter but also a bit in the second quarter. Yes, yes. Almost half. Thanks, Kyle. So in terms of the capital prioritization, we're super consistent with what we said at the Investor Day. We were really glad to be able to pay down the term loan this quarter and to end the quarter at 4.1. We are totally committed to all of the time lines that we have given at Investor Day. So the 9 to 12 months ahead, you can consider that to be something that we will deliver. \n And within that, we're keeping some flexibility to consider share repurchases if it makes sense. And that would be, in particular, related to the employee issuance. So offsetting the issuance, we think, is important, but when we look at it comprehensively, we are very, very focused on the deleveraging, in particular, because when you look at the EPS acquisition dilution, given some of the higher debt costs that we can repay even at our current stock price, it's still a really attractive proposition to do that. And of course, the cash flow accretion is something that we are focused on, too."
