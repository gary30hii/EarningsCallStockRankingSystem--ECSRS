Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference call over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had a strong fourth quarter that included an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio to 76.3%, which was a new fourth quarter company record. This combination led to the 34.2% increase in our earnings per diluted share. For the year, we also produced a company record operating ratio of 77.4% as well as an 11.4% increase in earnings per diluted share. While I am really proud of these financial results, I am more proud of the OD family of employees who work through tough conditions in 2020 to generate this success. Despite the operating challenges created by the pandemic and rapid changes in volumes, our team established a new record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.1%, while on-time service continued at 99%. These factors contributed to us winning the Mastio Quality Award for the 11th straight year. Our team is committed to delivering superior service at a fair price regardless of the circumstances, which is why we have often stated that the investment in our OD family is the most important investment we can make. This includes many things such as strong pay and benefits packages as well as training programs and advancement opportunities. In addition to our non-executive employees, their contributions during the pandemic we made special bonus payments in March and December 2020 that together totaled approximately $20 million. These factors as well as a strong family culture have allowed us to consistently attract and retain talented employees to support our growth initiatives. This is important as we intend to add to our OD family in 2021 by hiring additional employees to further increase the capacity of our workforce. With the demand improvement, environment improving we also intend to add the capacity of both our service center network and our fleet in 2021. After opening eight new facilities in 2020 and one more in January of this year, we are currently operating 245 service centers and have approximately 30% of excess capacity within the network to support additional growth. We plan to open two to three additional locations in the first quarter with several more during the remainder of the year. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that is not a limiting factor to growth over the next few years. While we acknowledged that certain uncertainties with the domestic economy may continue we believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2021. We also believe we can drive our operating ratio even lower than the 77.4% record that we established in 2020. We have long-maintained that the key components for long-term improvement in our operating ratio our improvements in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macro environment. Our current trends indicate that we can improve on both of these measures in 2021 by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our strong competitive position. Disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan over the course of many years has differentiated us from our competition, while also creating long-term record of profitable growth. We are encouraged by our recent revenue trend and believe that we can take advantage of the momentum in our business to increase our earnings and shareholder value in 2021. Thanks for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion which was a 6% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.61. These results include $9.6 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to non-executive employees in December. We were pleased to see the improvement in our revenue growth which included increases in both volumes and yield. The increase in revenue included a 4.9% increase in LTL tonnage and a 1.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 4.2%. The growth in this metric was slightly more consistent with our longer-term average than recent quarters as our business mix continue to normalize, while underlying pricing trends have remained relatively consistent. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 1.7%. These are both above our normal sequential trends and reflect the continued recovery from the initial drop in revenue in April that was related to the pandemic. For January our revenue per day increased 14.6% as compared to January of 2020. This reflects an 11.9% increase in LTL tons per day, an 2.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 76.3% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 we generally improved the efficiency of our operations with increases in our laden-load average and P&D shipments per hour. We did however lose a little productivity with our platform shipments per hour that was mainly due to the number of new employees hired in the fourth quarter. As our volume trends continue to improve we intend to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth -- first quarter. We also expect to continue to use purchased transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the fourth quarter by successfully leveraging our revenue growth and maintaining our discipline with discretionary spending. We will continue to control the discretionary spending in 2021 as we always do, but we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020 either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic will eventually be restored. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $246.6 million and $933 million for the fourth quarter and 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $58.6 million and $225.1 million for the same periods. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $605 million in 2020. This total includes $275 million to expand the capacity of our service center network although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long-term strategic plan. We returned $74.8 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and $435.1 million for the year. For 2020 this total included $364.1 million of share repurchases and $71 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Since we began this program in 2017 and after giving effect to the company's 3:2 stock split in March of 2020 we have increased our dividend in excess of 30% each year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2020 was 25.1% as compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam, I wasn't going to start with this, but you threw me off. Maybe you can provide a little bit more color on the strength that you're seeing in January the 11.9% increase in tons per day was stronger than what you looked in your trending in December. So if you had any color -- if you have any color on what you think is driving the strength in January that would be great?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. I think it's a couple of things, Todd. I mean, we certainly, really going back to April of 2020. Once we took that initial drop, business has just been accelerating since, generally speaking. And I think it began with customers reopening their businesses in different regions around the country getting healthier, and it just sort of accelerated from that point forward and that acceleration continued through the fourth quarter for us and into January as well. I think there is a lot of macro trends that are a favorable for our industry and certainly we're in an enviable position I think to take advantage of these changing trends. This is the type of environment I think, when our model usually shines the brightest. We're in a great spot with respect to the capacity of our service center network. Our fleet is in good shape, and we've talked about the fact that we're going to continue to hire new employees and we've continued to be successful in that endeavor in January as well. And we're also able to use a little purchased transportation to supplement as needed. But, our customers are getting healthier, business trends in general are improving and you're seeing the advantage of our business model just coming through for us, and we're able to take advantage of all of those improving trends and show a little growth which it's been a long time since we've been able to see growth like this. But certainly, when we start growing, we want to make sure it's profitable growth, and I think that we're in a good spot right now, and look forward to seeing this continue to play out in 2021.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. No, that sounds good. And then, maybe if you can just give a little bit more color -- you did a good job of continuing to leverage, shipment count growing faster than the headcount growth in the fourth quarter. Obviously in the prepared comments, you're talking about adding head counts. Can you give us a sense of kind of the trends maybe what you're expecting for sequential headcount growth in the first quarter, in the first half and how long you'd expect to continue to be able to increase the shipment count ahead of the headcount growth? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, as you know, over the long-term, the change in our headcount pretty much matches the change in our shipment counts as well, and certainly in a short-term period they're not always in balance, but that is something that we've seen over the long-term. Right now and really again kind of going back to the middle part of last year when we made resource adjustments, we pretty much have been trying to play catch-up if you will, and our team has been working incredibly hard in operations to keep up and to continue to service and produce essentially record service metrics for us. So we've been really proud of that, but the team has been working incredibly hard. We have been using increased purchased transportation. If you noticed that increased to 3.1% in the fourth quarter and typically for us is around 2.2%, because we like to have 100% of our line-haul network in-sourced and using our people and our equipment, but we had -- have had to supplement a little bit and until we can really completely staffed up to where we want to be. Typically headcount in the first quarter is kind of flattish on average with the fourth quarter.\nTodd Fowler: Yeah.\nAdam Satterfield: And based on what we've been able to achieve thus far in January, I think that the maximum sequential change we've ever seen was in 1Q of 2018 where we had about a 3% increase over 4Q. I think we can be in that range and probably even higher, but effectively we've just got to catch back up so we can continue to serve our customers and be able to first reduce our reliance on purchased transportation, and then just try to get ahead of the curve, if you will, to face whatever volumes come our way for both 2021 as well as 2022.\nTodd Fowler: Okay, got it. That makes sense. I'll turn it over. Thanks for the time this morning.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Great, thank you. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, I guess Adam, when we think about the sequential progression here if you kind of back out that special bonus payment there in the fourth quarter about a 75.4 OR. When you think about tonnage in January being better than normal seasonality, again, it's early in the quarter. How are you thinking about the potential, given your headcount comments there to Todd's question, the ability to sort of leverage that tonnage with sequential OR relative to normal seasonal pattern, which I think is typically 100 to 150 basis points degradation from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So, if you think about that base number of 75.4, given those headcount comments and some of the other items down the P&L, how are you thinking about sequential change, given what's happening on the tonnage front?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. You're right. The first quarter is typically 100 to 150 basis points of degradation from the fourth quarter. The special bonus that was in the fourth quarter, that's certainly something that I know you all will probably be adjusting, but that's not the only thing, that's one big thing that was called out, but you can see some other items, like our insurance and claims for example, that was a little bit lower than what the normal trend is. So, we anticipate that that will increase back to where we normally see it which is around 1% to 1.2% of revenue, and like many other carriers, we're going to be facing some increased inflationary costs, and that -- with our insurance premiums and so forth this year, just like we've faced the last couple of years. So, there's going to be some sort of puts and takes to it. General supplies and expenses is another one that I think will be stepping up. We referenced in our prepared remarks that certainly there is going to be some costs that will be restored this year and some of those will be some of our marketing and advertising programs. We're not at the point where our sales team can get out and travel around and do some things, so we still anticipate for the foreseeable future with some savings related to travel and customer entertainment, but certainly, intent to restore some of those expenditures. So, while they may not go back to where that cost had been between 3% and 3.5%, certainly anticipate them being higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. So, there is going to be some puts and takes. And we don't give guidance on the operating ratio, but we always use that normal sequential trend as a benchmark to measure ourselves against, and I think on the salary, wages and benefits line, when we talked about on the last quarter call, going from third quarter to fourth quarter, we wanted to try to keep the change in those costs and we felt like we could keep them in line with what our long-term trends are based on productivity, and the fact that we felt like revenue was improving well. Have a nice revenue growth on a sequential basis certainly gives you a lot of cover on some of those other more fixed type expense elements and I think we saw that leverage in us being enable to take advantage of that strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter to do just that. We create leverage from it. We kept the change in salaries, wages and benefits in line there. And so, I think certainly, that will give us leverage when we go from 4Q into 1Q as well to be able to keep those -- the salary cost, if you will, in line even though we will be bringing on and adding new people. So, there'll be puts and takes in different line items, but that sort of 100 basis point mark I think will be a good benchmark and we'll just see how we perform from there.\nJack Atkins: Okay, no, that makes sense and thank you for all that color. I guess for my follow-up question, maybe kind of a bigger picture question for you, Greg. When you look back over, just the broader LTL market over the last, call it 10 to 15 years, there really hasn't been a lot of underlying market growth. The Old Dominion has done a great job taking a lot of market share as you guys have been investing in your business and investing in service. As you look out over the next three, five, seven years, Greg, I mean do you see the market growth accelerating for the LTL industry, and I'm thinking specifically about e-commerce and the middle mile impact that e-commerce is having across the transportation sector. I would just be curious to get your thoughts on sort of where you see the broader industry going. Obviously, OD is going to expect to continue to take market share, but would appreciate your thoughts there?\nGreg Gantt: I would hope we would see some growth in our -- in the LTL -- on the LTL side. I think some of the e-commerce trends and whatnot that we've seen are somewhat positive for LTL. The fact that all the Amazons of the world and many others have open so many distribution facilities all across the country and have actually gotten closer to customers. So, you hope that some of the suppliers then are shipping to all these different type facilities and that lends itself to LTL versus truckload when you're talking about smaller quantities getting in customers' hands quicker. So, I think that's a positive trend from an e-commerce standpoint, certainly. I think that just the broader macro economy will be the telltale. How does it do? I don't think we've really had a huge boom and certainly not in the last couple of years, maybe back to 2018, but not in the last two, so I think the macro certainly will drive our market as well as truckload in some of the small packages. So, let's hope that there is certainly strength from that standpoint. But I think it's positive. I'm not expecting a boom certainly compared to -- over the last 10 years, but I think it will be certainly steady and we do expect some continued growth, certainly.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Thanks operator. Gentlemen, good morning, hope everyone is well. Wanted to talk a little bit about contract pricing, could you tell us or give us an idea of, how that went in the quarter? And then, sort of, what do you expect going forward, now that UPS Freight has been purchased by TFI, considering there have been more of a, discounter in the marketplace? And then, I have a follow-up.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. We don't necessarily detail out, what our contractual business is done versus our tariff-related business. But I think that, generally speaking, we've had a pricing philosophy that's been cost-based. And we expect each customer to give us pricing that's above those costs to support the investments we make in service and capacity and technology. And that's worked out well for us. We -- I think, we had success last year. And it was pretty continuous throughout the year, and all four quarters of being able to get increases, as contracts renewed and certainly would expect to continue that, as we transition into 2021.\nJason Seidl: And any comments on the market with UPS Freight and the purchase of that -- of those guys, or do you not run into them too much?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't really want to comment on, one specific carrier per se. But I certainly think that, the industry itself showed a lot of discipline, working through last year, especially in the second quarter when there was a lot of volume pressure. So it's been good to see the industry overall perform certainly that's been supportive of our own pricing initiatives, which we may be have philosophies that are slightly different from the industry generally, but certainly would expect a very favorable pricing environment in 2021. There's, a lot of factors that would go into that certainly demand is incredibly strong, capacity is generally limited, that's a lot of feedback that we are getting from customers right now. And that's just across the transportation space. And then, I think that, some of the other LTL carriers that utilize some truckload carriers for their line-haul services, certainly are facing may be more cost inflation than we are. And typically in that type of environment rates are rising faster as well to offset that cost inflation for those other carriers businesses. So I think there's a lot of factors that would point to industry pricing being very favorable for this year. And certainly should be supportive of our pricing initiatives.\nJason Seidl: Yeah. I would agree it seems like the backdrop is pretty good for the LTL business. Wanted to do a quick question, Adam, you mentioned that there is going to be some marketing advertising costs coming back. Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of those costs?\nAdam Satterfield: We've never really split out exactly, what we spend and where so to speak. Obviously, we've got some big national deals. And -- and we kind of put some programs on hold last year. And so, I think that -- would not expect those costs necessarily to be higher than where they were last year, but it's certainly something that we're expecting the cost to be higher if you will, than maybe what we've just seen in the past couple of quarters. That's really since we started making some changes and trying to address all of our cost initially in the second quarter of 2020. A lot of those items that were directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic the -- some temporary and some might be permanent we're in that general supplies and expenses line. And generally speaking, in the second quarter third quarter, those cost are more between 2.5% to 3%. We'd expect it to kind of go back up where in the past they've been 3% to 3.5%, somewhere not maybe to the full extent of that 3.5%. The calls will be continue to see some of those savings like I mentioned earlier, related to travel and so forth, but certainly kind of coming back maybe more to that range, but hopefully at the low end of it.\nJason Seidl: That's very helpful. Listen, gentlemen. I appreciate the time as always. Please be safe out there.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks Jason.\nOperator: And next we'll go to, David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.\nGreg Gantt: Dave.\nAdam Satterfield: Dave.\nDavid Ross: So, sometimes less is more or stop, doing stupid stuff is good advice. What is the one thing that you were doing maybe five to 10 years ago Greg or Adam that you're not doing now, that has made the biggest impact?\nGreg Gantt: I might have to go back a little further than that, David. I don't know, I think, we quit doing stupid things, maybe further than that. I don't know your question kind of -- it took me by surprise, but...\nDavid Ross: Well, if you go back to kind of 2005, 2006 because, I know that's when a lot of the service improvements started. Is there anything that you were doing then that just got in the way that you removed?\nGreg Gantt: So, we were somewhat like some of our competitors back in the day. We used a lot of purchase transportation. We were dependent upon those for our line-haul modes and whatnot we eliminated that over the years, and I think by and large we just gotten better. I don't want to say that we did stupid things, maybe that's not exactly the right terminology but I think we've just gotten smarter and we've gotten better over the years. We've understood better what our customer needs are and we figured out how to meet those needs, what do they really want what do they really need, and I think we're just better at it today than we were some years ago certainly. And I think it's indicative of our share growth continuing to win the MASTIO, which is a pretty good measure in stick of service. So I think it's maybe not what we did stupid but just what we've done smarter and what we've done better than our competitors have done, so maybe that's the best way to state it.\nDavid Ross: The MASTIO survey is terrific. Something else you've done smarter and better it's been on the pricing side, but that also wasn't always the case. Can you talk a little bit about the process to get to where you had your old pricing system model, accounts, rates and getting it to where you want to go? Is there a few key things you need to focus on or do along the way, because you don't want to just raise rates and have customers leave.\nGreg Gantt: Well, David, I think the pricing really goes hand-in-hand with the service. When your service is poor, sometimes the only way you're going to put a shipment on the truck is just give a cheaper rate. Once we really got the service click and lock it needed to be then we were in a much better position to raise our prices and I think we've been extremely disciplined over the years. And as the years have gone on, we've put in all the systems the dimensioners and all the techniques and all the technology that helps us to better understand exactly what our cost are be it P&D, be it line-haul, be it movement, delivery whatever. I think we certainly better understand our costs now than we did certainly 15 years ago, and we've executed on that understanding. So I think that's certainly been huge for us no doubt and we'll continue to be. We're disciplined, we know what our cost are in I think that's certainly one thing that sets us apart and helps to drive our numbers for sure.\nDavid Ross: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nGreg Gantt: Sure. Thanks David.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. If you see you to look at the outlook for 2021, and I know you guys don't like to guide the OR but if I go back to the last time your -- the growth tonnage double-digit to with 2018, your incremental margins were, sort of, in the 35% range. Not looking for a specific number this time around, but when you think about 2021 relative to 2018 at least from a cost perspective, is there anything that we should be thinking about, is labor tighter or the cost generally a little bit more inflationary now, and maybe the timing of volume growth versus resource additions potentially more challenging, or is there anything else that we should be thinking about if we're trying to use that as a rough rule of thumb of how you guys might perform of the course of 2021?\nGreg Gantt: Certainly we're going to face a lot of challenges as we go through this year and while certain top-line comps might be easier if you will. I mean, we were pretty proud to produce a lot of growth and profits in 2020 despite the fact that the revenues were down. At the end of the day we generated almost $90 million of the increase in operating income despite our revenues being down about $95 million. So certainly in some respects we'll have some tough comps, but I think this sort of pulling back and looking at our cost inflation anticipate that we'll probably see cost per shipment inflation around 4% this year. And it's a little bit higher than our longer term average, but I think we've got some factors that that will be coming back to us. I mentioned some of the general supplies and expense type inflation we might see would anticipate a little bit higher healthcare inflation this year. So we're going to see some inflationary pressures in some of the other categories. We always have a 3% to 3.5% inflationary cost in our salaries, wages and benefits as we continue to improve that program for our employees. And so all those factors will go into that metric and that will be our target and then that becomes the target for, which our long-term philosophy of trying to get 75 to a 100 basis points of rate increase above the cost inflation and then we just worked through from there. But I think that we've talked about the key ingredients for long-term, operating ratio improvement, or the improvement in density and yield, and I think certainly the macro set up would lead you to believe that we should be able to produce nice improvements in both. And we've gone through two years of being flat and each year, I thought that, we would have had some growth and certainly didn't expect the industrial slowdown in 2019. And I don't know that, Nostradamus is could predict what we saw last year, but we worked our way through it and I think we're in a good spot as we enter the year, and we're just going to continue to work our plan to try to drive the operating ratio lower. We've talked about kind of having a goal per se not necessarily incremental margins, because the reality is we're managing the business to put as much profit to the bottom line as we can and last year, the success that we saw sort of proves that out, but certainly should be in a position to create some strong incrementals this year, and we'll keep working toward the long-term goal that we've talked about of driving the operating ratio to a 75, so we'll just keep making progress there month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter as we work through 2021.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. And then just quick follow-up here thinking about the CapEx budget obviously stepping up and understandably so, can you talk a little bit I know you've given us some breakdown, but can you talk a little bit about sort of the opportunities that you see there in terms of deploying that capital? And then relative to that 30% available capacity coming into 2021, how do you want to sort of maintain that? Is that roughly the right amount of available capacity you'd like to have as you move forward?\nGreg Gantt: We generally talk about sort of 25% kind of plus or minus of excess capacity. And I think that continuing our CapEx programs through 2019 and 2020 continuing to build out the service center network certainly is going to pay dividends for us this year, with the increase in volumes that we're seeing now and would expect and probably for 2022 as well. So, I mean, we maintained our CapEx spending on real estate, and really last year was more just cutting back on the equipment and that was a plan we had in effect when we started the year and before seeing the pandemic effect on our business. But we were fortunate that that was part of the plan and certainly health and we didn't see the type of inflation and depreciation cost that, we normally would see and that was a big benefit there. But I think we're in a good spot. We're going to continue to look for opportunities. We've got a good plan on the real estate side the 275, is a good starting point. But we maintain our long-term plan and trying to look at multiple years out and still sort of have a target list of 30 to 40 properties and we'll keep our eyes peeled, and if some things become available. Certainly, we've got the strength to be able to pull the trigger on that and we'd look to just continue to make those expansions to really prepare the network for growth that's multiple years down the road.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Just a couple of follow-ups. First, how many service centers are you adding this year? And then within the January update, can you just talk about weight per shipment trends?\nGreg Gantt: Not only additional service centers, we have three that we're very close to opening that may open in the first quarter, if not first certainly second. And then, we have another half dozen or so that we're working on so just depends, if we get them completed or not. It's not always easy to sit here nine months out and say exactly what we're going to finish, but hopefully, another half dozen or so on top of the three that we are really, really close to opening there.\nAdam Satterfield: And then on the weight per shipment, it was 1,625 pound in January, which was a 4.6% increase there so continuing to see strong weight per shipments. Our business is still leaning a little heavier, if you will on our larger national accounts that have a higher weight per shipment on average. But I think that the strength in that number is some of our smaller customers get healthier and are making up coming back to normal, if you will in terms of a percent of our business. It's just a reflection on the strength in the economy right now and probably seeing a little bit of some spillover type freight that it's coming into the network as well.\nScott Group: Okay. And then Adam, how quickly do you expect the PTE spend to normalizes with higher than normal headcount in growth in 1Q, do you think you get back to normal PTE by 2Q or is it more back half you think?\nAdam Satterfield: It's hard to say, because it's going to be dependent upon the top-line performance. And certainly, we had a really strong sequential performance in 4Q. It was going through the sequentials last year and unprecedented drop like everyone else experienced from 1Q to 2Q, and then the reverse happened going into 3Q, but then incredibly strong performance going into 4Q, and I think we're starting out with some strength here in January as well. So, we're going to continue to make use of it really until the capacity of our team sort of catches up with the volume growth that we're seeing. So I don't -- wouldn't expect it to necessarily go any higher, because I think we're doing a great job of on-boarding people right now and keep in pace. So with -- certainly in the first quarter would expect it to stay pretty consistent with where we were in 4Q and we'd hope that we can start seeing it reduce a little bit in the second, but it could be more of a second half of the year, but again, I think it's just going to be top-line driven more than anything.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you guys.\nGreg Gantt : Scott.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next we'll go to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Gentlemen, I want to follow-up to a response about your earlier questions. It was pointed out that you've significantly outgrown the industry and a lot of that has been driven by share gain over the years, and you said that you expected the industry to be good, but not gangbusters growth in the next five years. So I just wanted to get a sense of kind of in your analysis of the industry structure right now, do you feel like you can keep up that outsized share gain kind of trend over the next several years? Do you think kind of that potential exists?\nGreg Gantt: I think it certainly does Ravi. We are -- our entire strategy is to continue to grow our capacity and increase our service center network and which is what we -- as you know, we've worked extremely hard to do that over the past 10, 15 years, and I think we've done it extremely well. So I think we are positioning to take advantage of whatever growth is out there. And I would certainly expect that we would outgrow our competitors. For the most part, we have not seen that from them. So we'll see where that goes, but I think we're well-positioned and certainly in a good spot to continue to take share.\nRavi Shanker: And you have said in the past that kind of you tend to gain accelerated share when the markets kind of starting to turn up rather than the market is going down. Are you seeing that already like in the fourth quarter and in January so far?\nAdam Satterfield: We are. Yes. We are seeing that. We're seeing the response from our customers. We've had numerous situations where our competitors could or didn't respond for whatever the reason and we were able to take advantage of that. So again, that's why we're doing what we're doing from a capacity standpoint, so we can be there when the need arises.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And just a follow-up, can you give us a little more color on your thoughts on this UPS, TFI deal, because I think it's a pretty big deal for the industry structure going forward. Were you surprised by that transaction at all and do you think this kicks off a domino effect of M&A or consolidation in the industry especially some of -- among some of the non-union players?\nAdam Satterfield: Like I said earlier, we'd rather just not comment on any specific competitors and transactions or whatnot. But I think regardless of who our competitors are, I think, we've kind of proven. What Greg just said, we keep focused on executing our plan making the investments. We have a service advantage in the marketplace and we have a capacity advantage as well and we're just going to keep doing our thing and staying focused on our employees, staying focused on our customers, and then just let in the financials kind of fall out in the end and that's included a lot of profitable growth over the years and certainly expect that to continue to do that regardless of the landscape.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz : Yes. Good morning. Wanted to ask, I know, you've had a few on this topic and you're not being granular about it but the TFI, UPS, you could argue that there might be some freights build into the market and they need to price up a lot and I think TFI is certainly shown that there disciplined in their approach they're not focused on volume they're focused on making money. So I don't know if you have a thought on whether they have good quality freight or not, but if you don't want to be that granular, perhaps you could offer a thought on is there bad freight that you don't want when there is tight capacity or is it simply a function of all freight is good as long as you price it right?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that the latter comment probably is the most appropriate. There is -- there probably is such a thing as bad freight not a ton of it, but there is a lot of bad pricing out there. So, priced appropriately there is very little bad freight, you just have to price based on what that particular commodity cost due to move it. And anyway I think, Tom, we've done that better than most and we understand if there is something that's expensive to hall of handle then, we're going to price it accordingly. What does that mean from the UPS or TransForce acquisition, who knows we'll just have to wait and see. I'm not sure what their strategy has been up in the Canadian market or down on this site at all, but we'll have to see certainly if they execute on the raise in prices and whatnot, I think that will be good for our industry. So I don't see it is certainly not from this standpoint now, it's not a negative, so I think that be good for all of us.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, right, okay. That makes sense. How do you think about mix in terms of industrial versus consumer? I think the kind of surprisingly strong swing back in freight in June, July, August, even in the fall, was that more on the consumer side? And I think you know the story in '21 would seem to be that industrial catches up or at least there is a stronger swing in industrial, is that something which could be meaningful in terms of your mix and helpful in terms of the operating ratio performance or how do you think about that potential impact if there's more industrial freight and not as much of a step-up in consumer?\nAdam Satterfield: One, we are more exposed to the industrial markets, as is the industry and our percentages stayed pretty consistent in '20 with '19, we're still 55% to 60% of our revenues industrial-related and close to 30 -- 25% to 30% industrial-related and over the balance of the year, they came in about the same that they were the year prior in. Fourth quarter revenue performance was pretty consistent with our industrial customers and retail-related customers as well, they were both in about the same range. So we look to certainly see the improvement in the industrial economy though create freight opportunities for us. And then, as Greg mentioned earlier, I think that there is going to be ongoing opportunity on the retail side and kind of leading up to 2020, we're probably seeing a little bit more growth in that retail area than on the industrial side, and I would expect that we'd see a little bit stronger performance there. But I think with respect to margins, we talked a lot about this throughout 2020 on our calls that our operating philosophy is, we want each customer to stand on its own. We measure the profitability of each customer and we look at each customer's operating ratio and whether it's a large national account or a smaller account or retail or industrial, they all should contribute in their own ways and that's how we try to manage the business and then look at each individual customer and try to drive continuous improvement with our operating ratio by keeping the business intact and just continuing to make improvements year in and year out with them. So the balance in the mix shift from one category to the next in that industrial versus retail categories or the national ship reverses the smaller one. I think we kind of proved out last year with our operating performance that we're true to our word in that regard and that each do kind of operate close to one another. So either way, we get the growth going into '21, certainly we'd expected it can continue to drive and help us drive improvement in the operating ratio.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, that's very clear and helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank you, good morning. First one, kind of bigger picture of macro drag on kind of on the last question as well. I think, there is a consensus view that the industrial economy is going to catch up to the consumer this year, at least that's the hope. That number that you put up on tons in January is obviously a pretty big number. Is that indicative of the industrial economy starting to show signs of really building momentum in your opinion or is that really kind of just a catch-up from the depths of the pandemic in the middle part of last year?\nGreg Gantt: I think its may be an effect of both, to be honest with you. I know there's catch up and resupply for sure, but no doubt about that. So we'll see where it goes as the year develops but hopefully the industrials do start to catch up. I think that'd be certainly a good thing for us as well as our industry.\nJon Chappell: Okay. And your customer is generally optimistic this from ton?\nGreg Gantt: For the most part, yes.\nJon Chappell: Great. And then the follow-up is, you mentioned right at the beginning of your comments about your spare capacity. So it certainly seems like you're lined up, this industrial economy does catch up. Are there any issues that may restrict your ability to take on new business, whether that's labor restrictions, just hiring, whether it's drivers or at terminals or any other issues beyond the obvious kind of equipment capacity?\nGreg Gantt: I don't think so, not beyond the obvious. I mean labor is a challenge, it's little tougher than it used to be, for sure, but we are having success. Adam mentioned it in his comments before, but our service centers are responding to their needs, and we are having success of adding employees', drivers', platform whatever the needs -- wherever the needs are. We are having that success. So that's a good thing. I wished it was a little bit faster, we could respond a little bit quicker, but it is what it is, but I think we're getting there. Sometimes your growth numbers changes your challenges, if you know what I mean. It's one thing, if it's in a some moderate tight growth, if the growth really starts to accelerate then the challenge becomes a little bit greater. So I think in a controlled tight growth environment, we're in great perfect shape. If we get a huge acceleration then that challenge is going to accelerate along with it. So we'll see where it goes but nothing right now and in our way certainly. We are...\nJon Chappell: Okay.\nGreg Gantt: Expecting a great year.\nJon Chappell: Certainly, it seems like you're responding quicker than most. Thanks for the thoughts Greg.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Thanks, good morning. So just in terms of the January revenue per hundredweight, up 2.2 is that inclusive of fuel? And if so, could you give us the ex-fuel number. And then just thinking about the 4.2% yield growth ex-fuel in Q4, maybe if you could give us a sense of what that looks like if you exclude the mix impacts from weight per shipment and length of haul? Just trying to get a sense of the underlying core pricing trends.\nGreg Gantt: Yeah, Allison that January number did include the fuel and excluding the fuel is pretty consistent the growth rate was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter so just over 4% if you will, and we'll continue to see until about April, really I think that that delta and some pressure on the fuel surcharge revenue and showing up in those metrics. I think that fuel was pretty consistently higher until about April of last year and then fuel trends hold current that will start becoming a little bit of a tailwind finally for us on a top-line basis. But I think that certainly, when you look through last year and kind of how that yield number excluding fuel is up 4.2% in the fourth quarter, there is not a perfect analysis if you will. There is not a linear way, purely linear way to evaluate the change in weight per shipment and length of haul but we had more pressure from the increase in weight per shipment in the middle part of the year in the second and third quarters. So certainly that 2.5% increase on the weight per shipment has got a negative effect but then you've got a 1.3% increase in the length of haul, so I mean there is somewhat offsetting. And I think that just the underlying performance and we review the \u2013 our growth in renewals and so forth consistent with our long-term average. We've been around whether you look over the past 10 to 15 years, we've been able to average about a 4.5% increase in our revenue per shipment and I think that we are pretty much in that category somewhere around that ballpark for last year. And certainly like I mentioned earlier, the strategy is always to try to target 75 to 100 basis points above our cost and I think that that's been a good consistent approach. We're not trying to necessarily always follow the market with more of a roller coaster type of approach we like it to be consistent. Customers generally appreciate that and it's easier conversation to have when you're just talking about pure cost or customers operating ratio to talk about the need for an increase but we'll continue to sort of target that type of range and certainly expect next year to be supportive of our ability to do so.\nAllison Landry: Okay, thank you for that. And then just I mean, so it seems like you should be able to generate pretty strong free cash flow this year even with elevated CapEx. I know you raised the dividends but maybe if you can share any thoughts you have on buybacks in 2021 and if that might accelerate from the repellent in 2020. Thank you.\nGregGantt: Yeah, certainly, when we've talked about priorities for capital allocation in the past, obviously the $605 million of CapEx, CapEx is the number one position. And I think while we've have been able to create such strong returns on invested capital and I want to keep investing there, but the excess capital that we've been generating in the business, we've been increasingly returning to our shareholders and we stepped up the pace of our buybacks last year and it's been a little over $360 million on the buyback program in 2020. So that was a nice step-up and we'll just continue to look at stepping those dollars up most likely, because it's certainly not something that we want to continue to have significant balance of cash hanging around on the balance sheet. But we also want to be mindful of the fact that there may continue to be some opportunities out there from a real estate standpoint and some of those in areas like on the West Coast and in the Northeast I've got some really expensive price tag. So we'll continue to look for some opportunities there and would rather spend our dollars on something that's more strategic like a long-term investment in the service center but absent those opportunities will continue to return capital to our shareholders.\nAllison Landry: Okay. Thank you guys.\nGreg Gantt: Bye Allison.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks guys. I'll make it quick I know we're coming up on the hour here. Just one quick ones from me Adam. If you can just help us how shipments trended sequentially from December to January versus maybe how they've done over the last 10 years what the actual number was? I know there were up 7% year-over-year, but just trying to gauge the sequential strength in shipments relative to seasonality from December to January?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. And I'll just go -- for the benefit of everyone, I'll go through the fourth quarter and these will be our shipments per day. So October versus September was down 3.3% November was 3% higher than October and then December was 4.2% lower than November. January was 1.4% higher than December. The 10-year average almost going back to October was a 3.3% decrease and November was a 1.8% increase and December is a 9.8% decrease. January is normally a 3% increase, but I think that given the strength of the performance that we had in both November and December as why that January numbers a little bit lower than the 10-year average given the outperformance of those two months prior. So it's been really strong performance like we said, really just throughout the year we took a little bit of a breather in October if you will. And as we were continuing to play catch-up and we're starting to get a lot of heavy shipments into the mix and -- but that was just really very temporary. And you can see kind of once we lifted any of those restrictions just the volumes continue to accelerate through the rest of the year and now into the first month of the New Year. So a lot of good favorable trends volume side.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah, so I just wanted to dig into that a little bit more. So it looks like December was double better than seasonality or half of the seasonal declines may explain a little bit of the January lag relative to seasonality. But there's three reasons why volumes could be inflecting, one is underlying growth in the industrial economy, two is spillover from truckload and three is just simple market share gains. And what I want to just be clear on is that you guys are clearly gaining market share you're clearly in the best position to drive spillover from truckload. I just what I'm trying not to -- I'm not trying to understand like the January strength on a year-over-year basis is that more indicative of OD specific factors or is it a read-through to the overall industrial economy because US industrial production is still negative on a year-over-year basis everybody expects it to inflect as we move through this year and we're right up there as well as expecting that. But I'm just trying to understand like decipher between those three attributions in terms of strong strength and strength of volumes?\nAdam Satterfield: You left out the quality of our sales team, so that's as point number one. But I think that we've kind of talked about these points earlier that we've got a service advantage that's unique in our industry and we're giving better service than anyone else. We've got a capacity advantage and we're starting to see and this is played out in years before, but we're starting to see this capacity advantage play out for us as well and we're getting feedback from customers that support that. And then you've got other factors, the industrial economy is improving. I know there is a lot of uncertainty and there always is in election year and now that's behind everyone, so you kind of have a better feel for what the regulatory environment and so forth is going to be. And so, hopefully, that's going to continue to support an improving economy as well, as just the country sort of reopening throughout. And so, all those factors, the demand improvement, inventories being low and the need for restocking, it's all just a matter of -- those are all favorable trends. But I think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that, with market share wins, for customers that we strengthen relationships throughout last year as we work with them and we are flexible. And I think that we've got improvements there that should pay dividends for the long run. And those customers are going to increasingly give us business, we think, and some that has historically had been more price-sensitive now have seen our ability to respond with them and give them capacity in a challenge time and to give them service. And maybe it's proved too many customers that, you may pay a little bit more upfront, but the total cost of transportation service, when selecting Old Dominion, can save a company money in the long run. So there\u2019s multiple factors, but at the end of the day, it goes back to the fact that we have a service advantage and a capacity advantage and those two factors are unique and have been the basis for why we've been able to grow market share, more than anyone else in our industry over the past 10 years.\nAmit Mehrotra: And then, just the 76.3% OR in the quarter, can you just tell us -- deconstruct that between direct and indirect. And I guess, the bonus payments would obviously be the part of the direct costs, I would imagine, but if you can just deconstruct that for us?\nAdam Satterfield: It's about 56% on the direct side and so our overhead cost, now, or kind of we've talked about those cost over the long run, have been sort of between 20% to 25% of revenue. And so, again, kind of, getting back to the quality of that revenue performance, we were able to move that number back down to lower end of that range. So, something we\u2019ll just continue to build on. Those bonuses are kind of split, obviously, more heavily to -- on the direct side, but for management and non-productive labor and meaning, drivers, dock workers and our mechanics, those cost we put more on the overhead side. And so, there\u2019s an element of that bonus that would therefore be split into overhead as well, but the majority of it's going to be on the direct side.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I'm just curious, the expansion that you're talking about of the service centers, just sort of wondering, how long does it typically take to, if you will, get the density needed to fully season one of these facilities, so that it gets closer to the margins that you wanted, or is it a situation where the density such in the area that, it can come in pretty quickly close to an OD type of margin level. Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: It typically does not take long in our system. We won't open additional facility till the need is there for the most part. We may certainly have excess capacity in there, but we don't fully utilize it from day one. So we're not absorbing necessarily all those cost from the outset, but typically we will put a lot of business in that service center from the get-go. So there is not usually a long climb to our typical normal type returns in a service center.\nJordan Alliger: Okay, great. That was it from me. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Next we'll go to Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: Hey. Good morning, guys, and congrats on a nice quarter. So, I had, kind of, two questions. So first I wanted to ask about just the weight per shipment trends and I know Scott touched on this earlier. But seeing more supply, seemingly entering the truckload market and some elevated order numbers on the Class 8 trucks, maybe you could talk about what your expectation is for, kind of, the weight per shipment trend over the course of the year and if we see that may be return to kind of normal levels, or more normalized levels, as we move toward kind of the second half?\nAdam Satterfield: We're -- like I mentioned, we're at 1625-pounds and I think when we've been in strong environments from strong demand backdrops. We've been around a 1600-pound average in the past. Certainly, you can go back and look at 2018 and that was around the range we were in then. So I think it can stay in this 1600 to maybe 1650 kind of range as we progress through the year and certainly we'd see some ups and downs.  But I think that like I mentioned, we're continuing to see good performance with our smaller customers and they are naturally going to have a little bit lower weight per shipment, so that will bring it down. But just the overall demand environment I think is keeping all shipments a little bit stronger from a weight perspective. I don't think we're really getting flooded, if you will with spillover-type freight. When I look through it, the business we have with third-party logistics companies, a lot of time with our capacity constraints in the market they're able to go out and find and help their customers who are also our customers find capacity. And certainly, we've seen a little bit higher weight per shipment growth with business is controlled by the 3PLs then the rest of our book of business if you will.  So I would expect it to stay in that sort of elevated range just given all the favorable economic backdrop numbers and then just the fact that we still believe capacity is generally constrained in the industry.\nAri Rosa: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then just for my second question and I know number of people obviously asked about the TFI deal with UPS Freight. But stepping back and not necessarily addressing them specifically, but thinking about the idea of having a more focused competitive set. You guys have obviously benefited tremendously from delivering exceptional service levels. Does it perhaps risk kind of a part of your competitive advantage if peers start to improve service levels and start to kind of emulate OD more in terms of the structures of their network and the service levels that they are able to provide?  Do you see that as a competitive threat at all or do you think kind of margins can kind of remain best in-class and kind of you guys can continue doing what you're doing regardless of what our competitors are doing on the service side?\nAdam Satterfield: I think, it's obviously a threat, no doubt. I mean, if you got to a bad team you improve the players and it's a threat to all the other team, so no doubt. But I think they've got to do it, they've got to pull it off and there is an awful lot that goes into service and we worked awfully hard on it over the years, not only a, to be on time, but all the other things that go into a true service product and I think we do it better than others. And hey, it's out there, it's not rocket science, but they've got to do it. So we'll see how they do.\nGreg Gantt: Just add though to that, that the fact that it is a unionized company and the non-union carriers generally have got more flexibility within their workforce in a better service product and you've seen more market share movement to the non-union players as the length of haul shrink in and there is more of a premium within supply chains to look at carriers that can respond the next day and second-day needs. And I think that we've got more flexibility as a group of non-union carriers.  I mean, I think we've got an advantage within that group as we've talked about earlier to be able to continue to win share. So I mean that's something that's been playing out over the long run and we'd expect to continue to see share movement from unionized and non-unionized players.\nAri Rosa: Got it, got it. And that's a terrific answer and thank you for the time and you guys clearly have a strong track record in that regard. So thanks for that.\nGreg Gantt: All right.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate the questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion had a strong fourth quarter that included an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio to 76.3%, which was a new fourth quarter company record. This combination led to the 34.2% increase in our earnings per diluted share. For the year, we also produced a company record operating ratio of 77.4% as well as an 11.4% increase in earnings per diluted share. While I am really proud of these financial results, I am more proud of the OD family of employees who work through tough conditions in 2020 to generate this success. Despite the operating challenges created by the pandemic and rapid changes in volumes, our team established a new record for our cargo claims ratio at 0.1%, while on-time service continued at 99%. These factors contributed to us winning the Mastio Quality Award for the 11th straight year. Our team is committed to delivering superior service at a fair price regardless of the circumstances, which is why we have often stated that the investment in our OD family is the most important investment we can make. This includes many things such as strong pay and benefits packages as well as training programs and advancement opportunities. In addition to our non-executive employees, their contributions during the pandemic we made special bonus payments in March and December 2020 that together totaled approximately $20 million. These factors as well as a strong family culture have allowed us to consistently attract and retain talented employees to support our growth initiatives. This is important as we intend to add to our OD family in 2021 by hiring additional employees to further increase the capacity of our workforce. With the demand improvement, environment improving we also intend to add the capacity of both our service center network and our fleet in 2021. After opening eight new facilities in 2020 and one more in January of this year, we are currently operating 245 service centers and have approximately 30% of excess capacity within the network to support additional growth. We plan to open two to three additional locations in the first quarter with several more during the remainder of the year. We believe these additional service centers as well as the expansion of some existing facilities will increase the overall average capacity within our network to ensure that is not a limiting factor to growth over the next few years. While we acknowledged that certain uncertainties with the domestic economy may continue we believe that Old Dominion is uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2021. We also believe we can drive our operating ratio even lower than the 77.4% record that we established in 2020. We have long-maintained that the key components for long-term improvement in our operating ratio our improvements in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macro environment. Our current trends indicate that we can improve on both of these measures in 2021 by remaining fully committed to the core business strategies that put us in our strong competitive position. Disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan over the course of many years has differentiated us from our competition, while also creating long-term record of profitable growth. We are encouraged by our recent revenue trend and believe that we can take advantage of the momentum in our business to increase our earnings and shareholder value in 2021. Thanks for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. I would hope we would see some growth in our -- in the LTL -- on the LTL side. I think some of the e-commerce trends and whatnot that we've seen are somewhat positive for LTL. The fact that all the Amazons of the world and many others have open so many distribution facilities all across the country and have actually gotten closer to customers. So, you hope that some of the suppliers then are shipping to all these different type facilities and that lends itself to LTL versus truckload when you're talking about smaller quantities getting in customers' hands quicker. So, I think that's a positive trend from an e-commerce standpoint, certainly. I think that just the broader macro economy will be the telltale. How does it do? I don't think we've really had a huge boom and certainly not in the last couple of years, maybe back to 2018, but not in the last two, so I think the macro certainly will drive our market as well as truckload in some of the small packages. So, let's hope that there is certainly strength from that standpoint. But I think it's positive. I'm not expecting a boom certainly compared to -- over the last 10 years, but I think it will be certainly steady and we do expect some continued growth, certainly. Thanks Jason. Dave. I might have to go back a little further than that, David. I don't know, I think, we quit doing stupid things, maybe further than that. I don't know your question kind of -- it took me by surprise, but... So, we were somewhat like some of our competitors back in the day. We used a lot of purchase transportation. We were dependent upon those for our line-haul modes and whatnot we eliminated that over the years, and I think by and large we just gotten better. I don't want to say that we did stupid things, maybe that's not exactly the right terminology but I think we've just gotten smarter and we've gotten better over the years. We've understood better what our customer needs are and we figured out how to meet those needs, what do they really want what do they really need, and I think we're just better at it today than we were some years ago certainly. And I think it's indicative of our share growth continuing to win the MASTIO, which is a pretty good measure in stick of service. So I think it's maybe not what we did stupid but just what we've done smarter and what we've done better than our competitors have done, so maybe that's the best way to state it. Well, David, I think the pricing really goes hand-in-hand with the service. When your service is poor, sometimes the only way you're going to put a shipment on the truck is just give a cheaper rate. Once we really got the service click and lock it needed to be then we were in a much better position to raise our prices and I think we've been extremely disciplined over the years. And as the years have gone on, we've put in all the systems the dimensioners and all the techniques and all the technology that helps us to better understand exactly what our cost are be it P&D, be it line-haul, be it movement, delivery whatever. I think we certainly better understand our costs now than we did certainly 15 years ago, and we've executed on that understanding. So I think that's certainly been huge for us no doubt and we'll continue to be. We're disciplined, we know what our cost are in I think that's certainly one thing that sets us apart and helps to drive our numbers for sure. Sure. Thanks David. Certainly we're going to face a lot of challenges as we go through this year and while certain top-line comps might be easier if you will. I mean, we were pretty proud to produce a lot of growth and profits in 2020 despite the fact that the revenues were down. At the end of the day we generated almost $90 million of the increase in operating income despite our revenues being down about $95 million. So certainly in some respects we'll have some tough comps, but I think this sort of pulling back and looking at our cost inflation anticipate that we'll probably see cost per shipment inflation around 4% this year. And it's a little bit higher than our longer term average, but I think we've got some factors that that will be coming back to us. I mentioned some of the general supplies and expense type inflation we might see would anticipate a little bit higher healthcare inflation this year. So we're going to see some inflationary pressures in some of the other categories. We always have a 3% to 3.5% inflationary cost in our salaries, wages and benefits as we continue to improve that program for our employees. And so all those factors will go into that metric and that will be our target and then that becomes the target for, which our long-term philosophy of trying to get 75 to a 100 basis points of rate increase above the cost inflation and then we just worked through from there. But I think that we've talked about the key ingredients for long-term, operating ratio improvement, or the improvement in density and yield, and I think certainly the macro set up would lead you to believe that we should be able to produce nice improvements in both. And we've gone through two years of being flat and each year, I thought that, we would have had some growth and certainly didn't expect the industrial slowdown in 2019. And I don't know that, Nostradamus is could predict what we saw last year, but we worked our way through it and I think we're in a good spot as we enter the year, and we're just going to continue to work our plan to try to drive the operating ratio lower. We've talked about kind of having a goal per se not necessarily incremental margins, because the reality is we're managing the business to put as much profit to the bottom line as we can and last year, the success that we saw sort of proves that out, but certainly should be in a position to create some strong incrementals this year, and we'll keep working toward the long-term goal that we've talked about of driving the operating ratio to a 75, so we'll just keep making progress there month-by-month and quarter-by-quarter as we work through 2021. We generally talk about sort of 25% kind of plus or minus of excess capacity. And I think that continuing our CapEx programs through 2019 and 2020 continuing to build out the service center network certainly is going to pay dividends for us this year, with the increase in volumes that we're seeing now and would expect and probably for 2022 as well. So, I mean, we maintained our CapEx spending on real estate, and really last year was more just cutting back on the equipment and that was a plan we had in effect when we started the year and before seeing the pandemic effect on our business. But we were fortunate that that was part of the plan and certainly health and we didn't see the type of inflation and depreciation cost that, we normally would see and that was a big benefit there. But I think we're in a good spot. We're going to continue to look for opportunities. We've got a good plan on the real estate side the 275, is a good starting point. But we maintain our long-term plan and trying to look at multiple years out and still sort of have a target list of 30 to 40 properties and we'll keep our eyes peeled, and if some things become available. Certainly, we've got the strength to be able to pull the trigger on that and we'd look to just continue to make those expansions to really prepare the network for growth that's multiple years down the road. Not only additional service centers, we have three that we're very close to opening that may open in the first quarter, if not first certainly second. And then, we have another half dozen or so that we're working on so just depends, if we get them completed or not. It's not always easy to sit here nine months out and say exactly what we're going to finish, but hopefully, another half dozen or so on top of the three that we are really, really close to opening there. Scott. I think it certainly does Ravi. We are -- our entire strategy is to continue to grow our capacity and increase our service center network and which is what we -- as you know, we've worked extremely hard to do that over the past 10, 15 years, and I think we've done it extremely well. So I think we are positioning to take advantage of whatever growth is out there. And I would certainly expect that we would outgrow our competitors. For the most part, we have not seen that from them. So we'll see where that goes, but I think we're well-positioned and certainly in a good spot to continue to take share. I think its may be an effect of both, to be honest with you. I know there's catch up and resupply for sure, but no doubt about that. So we'll see where it goes as the year develops but hopefully the industrials do start to catch up. I think that'd be certainly a good thing for us as well as our industry. For the most part, yes. I don't think so, not beyond the obvious. I mean labor is a challenge, it's little tougher than it used to be, for sure, but we are having success. Adam mentioned it in his comments before, but our service centers are responding to their needs, and we are having success of adding employees', drivers', platform whatever the needs -- wherever the needs are. We are having that success. So that's a good thing. I wished it was a little bit faster, we could respond a little bit quicker, but it is what it is, but I think we're getting there. Sometimes your growth numbers changes your challenges, if you know what I mean. It's one thing, if it's in a some moderate tight growth, if the growth really starts to accelerate then the challenge becomes a little bit greater. So I think in a controlled tight growth environment, we're in great perfect shape. If we get a huge acceleration then that challenge is going to accelerate along with it. So we'll see where it goes but nothing right now and in our way certainly. We are... Expecting a great year. Yeah, Allison that January number did include the fuel and excluding the fuel is pretty consistent the growth rate was pretty consistent with the fourth quarter so just over 4% if you will, and we'll continue to see until about April, really I think that that delta and some pressure on the fuel surcharge revenue and showing up in those metrics. I think that fuel was pretty consistently higher until about April of last year and then fuel trends hold current that will start becoming a little bit of a tailwind finally for us on a top-line basis. But I think that certainly, when you look through last year and kind of how that yield number excluding fuel is up 4.2% in the fourth quarter, there is not a perfect analysis if you will. There is not a linear way, purely linear way to evaluate the change in weight per shipment and length of haul but we had more pressure from the increase in weight per shipment in the middle part of the year in the second and third quarters. So certainly that 2.5% increase on the weight per shipment has got a negative effect but then you've got a 1.3% increase in the length of haul, so I mean there is somewhat offsetting. And I think that just the underlying performance and we review the \u2013 our growth in renewals and so forth consistent with our long-term average. We've been around whether you look over the past 10 to 15 years, we've been able to average about a 4.5% increase in our revenue per shipment and I think that we are pretty much in that category somewhere around that ballpark for last year. And certainly like I mentioned earlier, the strategy is always to try to target 75 to 100 basis points above our cost and I think that that's been a good consistent approach. We're not trying to necessarily always follow the market with more of a roller coaster type of approach we like it to be consistent. Customers generally appreciate that and it's easier conversation to have when you're just talking about pure cost or customers operating ratio to talk about the need for an increase but we'll continue to sort of target that type of range and certainly expect next year to be supportive of our ability to do so. Yeah, certainly, when we've talked about priorities for capital allocation in the past, obviously the $605 million of CapEx, CapEx is the number one position. And I think while we've have been able to create such strong returns on invested capital and I want to keep investing there, but the excess capital that we've been generating in the business, we've been increasingly returning to our shareholders and we stepped up the pace of our buybacks last year and it's been a little over $360 million on the buyback program in 2020. So that was a nice step-up and we'll just continue to look at stepping those dollars up most likely, because it's certainly not something that we want to continue to have significant balance of cash hanging around on the balance sheet. But we also want to be mindful of the fact that there may continue to be some opportunities out there from a real estate standpoint and some of those in areas like on the West Coast and in the Northeast I've got some really expensive price tag. So we'll continue to look for some opportunities there and would rather spend our dollars on something that's more strategic like a long-term investment in the service center but absent those opportunities will continue to return capital to our shareholders. Bye Allison. It typically does not take long in our system. We won't open additional facility till the need is there for the most part. We may certainly have excess capacity in there, but we don't fully utilize it from day one. So we're not absorbing necessarily all those cost from the outset, but typically we will put a lot of business in that service center from the get-go. So there is not usually a long climb to our typical normal type returns in a service center. Just add though to that, that the fact that it is a unionized company and the non-union carriers generally have got more flexibility within their workforce in a better service product and you've seen more market share movement to the non-union players as the length of haul shrink in and there is more of a premium within supply chains to look at carriers that can respond the next day and second-day needs. And I think that we've got more flexibility as a group of non-union carriers.  I mean, I think we've got an advantage within that group as we've talked about earlier to be able to continue to win share. So I mean that's something that's been playing out over the long run and we'd expect to continue to see share movement from unionized and non-unionized players. All right. Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate the questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion which was a 6% increase from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 500 basis points to 76.3% and earnings per diluted share increased to $1.61. These results include $9.6 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to non-executive employees in December. We were pleased to see the improvement in our revenue growth which included increases in both volumes and yield. The increase in revenue included a 4.9% increase in LTL tonnage and a 1.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Excluding fuel surcharges, our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased by 4.2%. The growth in this metric was slightly more consistent with our longer-term average than recent quarters as our business mix continue to normalize, while underlying pricing trends have remained relatively consistent. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 4.7% as compared to the third quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 1.7%. These are both above our normal sequential trends and reflect the continued recovery from the initial drop in revenue in April that was related to the pandemic. For January our revenue per day increased 14.6% as compared to January of 2020. This reflects an 11.9% increase in LTL tons per day, an 2.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 76.3% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 we generally improved the efficiency of our operations with increases in our laden-load average and P&D shipments per hour. We did however lose a little productivity with our platform shipments per hour that was mainly due to the number of new employees hired in the fourth quarter. As our volume trends continue to improve we intend to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth -- first quarter. We also expect to continue to use purchased transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can fully support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the fourth quarter by successfully leveraging our revenue growth and maintaining our discipline with discretionary spending. We will continue to control the discretionary spending in 2021 as we always do, but we anticipate that certain costs that were reduced in 2020 either directly or indirectly due to the pandemic will eventually be restored. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $246.6 million and $933 million for the fourth quarter and 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $58.6 million and $225.1 million for the same periods. Based on anticipated growth and the execution of our equipment replacement cycle, our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $605 million in 2020. This total includes $275 million to expand the capacity of our service center network although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long-term strategic plan. We returned $74.8 million of capital to shareholders during the fourth quarter and $435.1 million for the year. For 2020 this total included $364.1 million of share repurchases and $71 million in cash dividends. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per share in the first quarter of 2021. Since we began this program in 2017 and after giving effect to the company's 3:2 stock split in March of 2020 we have increased our dividend in excess of 30% each year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2020 was 25.1% as compared to 24% in the fourth quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Yeah. I think it's a couple of things, Todd. I mean, we certainly, really going back to April of 2020. Once we took that initial drop, business has just been accelerating since, generally speaking. And I think it began with customers reopening their businesses in different regions around the country getting healthier, and it just sort of accelerated from that point forward and that acceleration continued through the fourth quarter for us and into January as well. I think there is a lot of macro trends that are a favorable for our industry and certainly we're in an enviable position I think to take advantage of these changing trends. This is the type of environment I think, when our model usually shines the brightest. We're in a great spot with respect to the capacity of our service center network. Our fleet is in good shape, and we've talked about the fact that we're going to continue to hire new employees and we've continued to be successful in that endeavor in January as well. And we're also able to use a little purchased transportation to supplement as needed. But, our customers are getting healthier, business trends in general are improving and you're seeing the advantage of our business model just coming through for us, and we're able to take advantage of all of those improving trends and show a little growth which it's been a long time since we've been able to see growth like this. But certainly, when we start growing, we want to make sure it's profitable growth, and I think that we're in a good spot right now, and look forward to seeing this continue to play out in 2021. Well, as you know, over the long-term, the change in our headcount pretty much matches the change in our shipment counts as well, and certainly in a short-term period they're not always in balance, but that is something that we've seen over the long-term. Right now and really again kind of going back to the middle part of last year when we made resource adjustments, we pretty much have been trying to play catch-up if you will, and our team has been working incredibly hard in operations to keep up and to continue to service and produce essentially record service metrics for us. So we've been really proud of that, but the team has been working incredibly hard. We have been using increased purchased transportation. If you noticed that increased to 3.1% in the fourth quarter and typically for us is around 2.2%, because we like to have 100% of our line-haul network in-sourced and using our people and our equipment, but we had -- have had to supplement a little bit and until we can really completely staffed up to where we want to be. Typically headcount in the first quarter is kind of flattish on average with the fourth quarter. And based on what we've been able to achieve thus far in January, I think that the maximum sequential change we've ever seen was in 1Q of 2018 where we had about a 3% increase over 4Q. I think we can be in that range and probably even higher, but effectively we've just got to catch back up so we can continue to serve our customers and be able to first reduce our reliance on purchased transportation, and then just try to get ahead of the curve, if you will, to face whatever volumes come our way for both 2021 as well as 2022. Sure. You're right. The first quarter is typically 100 to 150 basis points of degradation from the fourth quarter. The special bonus that was in the fourth quarter, that's certainly something that I know you all will probably be adjusting, but that's not the only thing, that's one big thing that was called out, but you can see some other items, like our insurance and claims for example, that was a little bit lower than what the normal trend is. So, we anticipate that that will increase back to where we normally see it which is around 1% to 1.2% of revenue, and like many other carriers, we're going to be facing some increased inflationary costs, and that -- with our insurance premiums and so forth this year, just like we've faced the last couple of years. So, there's going to be some sort of puts and takes to it. General supplies and expenses is another one that I think will be stepping up. We referenced in our prepared remarks that certainly there is going to be some costs that will be restored this year and some of those will be some of our marketing and advertising programs. We're not at the point where our sales team can get out and travel around and do some things, so we still anticipate for the foreseeable future with some savings related to travel and customer entertainment, but certainly, intent to restore some of those expenditures. So, while they may not go back to where that cost had been between 3% and 3.5%, certainly anticipate them being higher than where we were in the fourth quarter. So, there is going to be some puts and takes. And we don't give guidance on the operating ratio, but we always use that normal sequential trend as a benchmark to measure ourselves against, and I think on the salary, wages and benefits line, when we talked about on the last quarter call, going from third quarter to fourth quarter, we wanted to try to keep the change in those costs and we felt like we could keep them in line with what our long-term trends are based on productivity, and the fact that we felt like revenue was improving well. Have a nice revenue growth on a sequential basis certainly gives you a lot of cover on some of those other more fixed type expense elements and I think we saw that leverage in us being enable to take advantage of that strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter to do just that. We create leverage from it. We kept the change in salaries, wages and benefits in line there. And so, I think certainly, that will give us leverage when we go from 4Q into 1Q as well to be able to keep those -- the salary cost, if you will, in line even though we will be bringing on and adding new people. So, there'll be puts and takes in different line items, but that sort of 100 basis point mark I think will be a good benchmark and we'll just see how we perform from there. Yeah. We don't necessarily detail out, what our contractual business is done versus our tariff-related business. But I think that, generally speaking, we've had a pricing philosophy that's been cost-based. And we expect each customer to give us pricing that's above those costs to support the investments we make in service and capacity and technology. And that's worked out well for us. We -- I think, we had success last year. And it was pretty continuous throughout the year, and all four quarters of being able to get increases, as contracts renewed and certainly would expect to continue that, as we transition into 2021. I don't really want to comment on, one specific carrier per se. But I certainly think that, the industry itself showed a lot of discipline, working through last year, especially in the second quarter when there was a lot of volume pressure. So it's been good to see the industry overall perform certainly that's been supportive of our own pricing initiatives, which we may be have philosophies that are slightly different from the industry generally, but certainly would expect a very favorable pricing environment in 2021. There's, a lot of factors that would go into that certainly demand is incredibly strong, capacity is generally limited, that's a lot of feedback that we are getting from customers right now. And that's just across the transportation space. And then, I think that, some of the other LTL carriers that utilize some truckload carriers for their line-haul services, certainly are facing may be more cost inflation than we are. And typically in that type of environment rates are rising faster as well to offset that cost inflation for those other carriers businesses. So I think there's a lot of factors that would point to industry pricing being very favorable for this year. And certainly should be supportive of our pricing initiatives. We've never really split out exactly, what we spend and where so to speak. Obviously, we've got some big national deals. And -- and we kind of put some programs on hold last year. And so, I think that -- would not expect those costs necessarily to be higher than where they were last year, but it's certainly something that we're expecting the cost to be higher if you will, than maybe what we've just seen in the past couple of quarters. That's really since we started making some changes and trying to address all of our cost initially in the second quarter of 2020. A lot of those items that were directly or indirectly affected by the pandemic the -- some temporary and some might be permanent we're in that general supplies and expenses line. And generally speaking, in the second quarter third quarter, those cost are more between 2.5% to 3%. We'd expect it to kind of go back up where in the past they've been 3% to 3.5%, somewhere not maybe to the full extent of that 3.5%. The calls will be continue to see some of those savings like I mentioned earlier, related to travel and so forth, but certainly kind of coming back maybe more to that range, but hopefully at the low end of it. Dave. And then on the weight per shipment, it was 1,625 pound in January, which was a 4.6% increase there so continuing to see strong weight per shipments. Our business is still leaning a little heavier, if you will on our larger national accounts that have a higher weight per shipment on average. But I think that the strength in that number is some of our smaller customers get healthier and are making up coming back to normal, if you will in terms of a percent of our business. It's just a reflection on the strength in the economy right now and probably seeing a little bit of some spillover type freight that it's coming into the network as well. It's hard to say, because it's going to be dependent upon the top-line performance. And certainly, we had a really strong sequential performance in 4Q. It was going through the sequentials last year and unprecedented drop like everyone else experienced from 1Q to 2Q, and then the reverse happened going into 3Q, but then incredibly strong performance going into 4Q, and I think we're starting out with some strength here in January as well. So, we're going to continue to make use of it really until the capacity of our team sort of catches up with the volume growth that we're seeing. So I don't -- wouldn't expect it to necessarily go any higher, because I think we're doing a great job of on-boarding people right now and keep in pace. So with -- certainly in the first quarter would expect it to stay pretty consistent with where we were in 4Q and we'd hope that we can start seeing it reduce a little bit in the second, but it could be more of a second half of the year, but again, I think it's just going to be top-line driven more than anything. We are. Yes. We are seeing that. We're seeing the response from our customers. We've had numerous situations where our competitors could or didn't respond for whatever the reason and we were able to take advantage of that. So again, that's why we're doing what we're doing from a capacity standpoint, so we can be there when the need arises. Like I said earlier, we'd rather just not comment on any specific competitors and transactions or whatnot. But I think regardless of who our competitors are, I think, we've kind of proven. What Greg just said, we keep focused on executing our plan making the investments. We have a service advantage in the marketplace and we have a capacity advantage as well and we're just going to keep doing our thing and staying focused on our employees, staying focused on our customers, and then just let in the financials kind of fall out in the end and that's included a lot of profitable growth over the years and certainly expect that to continue to do that regardless of the landscape. I think that the latter comment probably is the most appropriate. There is -- there probably is such a thing as bad freight not a ton of it, but there is a lot of bad pricing out there. So, priced appropriately there is very little bad freight, you just have to price based on what that particular commodity cost due to move it. And anyway I think, Tom, we've done that better than most and we understand if there is something that's expensive to hall of handle then, we're going to price it accordingly. What does that mean from the UPS or TransForce acquisition, who knows we'll just have to wait and see. I'm not sure what their strategy has been up in the Canadian market or down on this site at all, but we'll have to see certainly if they execute on the raise in prices and whatnot, I think that will be good for our industry. So I don't see it is certainly not from this standpoint now, it's not a negative, so I think that be good for all of us. One, we are more exposed to the industrial markets, as is the industry and our percentages stayed pretty consistent in '20 with '19, we're still 55% to 60% of our revenues industrial-related and close to 30 -- 25% to 30% industrial-related and over the balance of the year, they came in about the same that they were the year prior in. Fourth quarter revenue performance was pretty consistent with our industrial customers and retail-related customers as well, they were both in about the same range. So we look to certainly see the improvement in the industrial economy though create freight opportunities for us. And then, as Greg mentioned earlier, I think that there is going to be ongoing opportunity on the retail side and kind of leading up to 2020, we're probably seeing a little bit more growth in that retail area than on the industrial side, and I would expect that we'd see a little bit stronger performance there. But I think with respect to margins, we talked a lot about this throughout 2020 on our calls that our operating philosophy is, we want each customer to stand on its own. We measure the profitability of each customer and we look at each customer's operating ratio and whether it's a large national account or a smaller account or retail or industrial, they all should contribute in their own ways and that's how we try to manage the business and then look at each individual customer and try to drive continuous improvement with our operating ratio by keeping the business intact and just continuing to make improvements year in and year out with them. So the balance in the mix shift from one category to the next in that industrial versus retail categories or the national ship reverses the smaller one. I think we kind of proved out last year with our operating performance that we're true to our word in that regard and that each do kind of operate close to one another. So either way, we get the growth going into '21, certainly we'd expected it can continue to drive and help us drive improvement in the operating ratio. Sure. And I'll just go -- for the benefit of everyone, I'll go through the fourth quarter and these will be our shipments per day. So October versus September was down 3.3% November was 3% higher than October and then December was 4.2% lower than November. January was 1.4% higher than December. The 10-year average almost going back to October was a 3.3% decrease and November was a 1.8% increase and December is a 9.8% decrease. January is normally a 3% increase, but I think that given the strength of the performance that we had in both November and December as why that January numbers a little bit lower than the 10-year average given the outperformance of those two months prior. So it's been really strong performance like we said, really just throughout the year we took a little bit of a breather in October if you will. And as we were continuing to play catch-up and we're starting to get a lot of heavy shipments into the mix and -- but that was just really very temporary. And you can see kind of once we lifted any of those restrictions just the volumes continue to accelerate through the rest of the year and now into the first month of the New Year. So a lot of good favorable trends volume side. You left out the quality of our sales team, so that's as point number one. But I think that we've kind of talked about these points earlier that we've got a service advantage that's unique in our industry and we're giving better service than anyone else. We've got a capacity advantage and we're starting to see and this is played out in years before, but we're starting to see this capacity advantage play out for us as well and we're getting feedback from customers that support that. And then you've got other factors, the industrial economy is improving. I know there is a lot of uncertainty and there always is in election year and now that's behind everyone, so you kind of have a better feel for what the regulatory environment and so forth is going to be. And so, hopefully, that's going to continue to support an improving economy as well, as just the country sort of reopening throughout. And so, all those factors, the demand improvement, inventories being low and the need for restocking, it's all just a matter of -- those are all favorable trends. But I think that we're uniquely positioned to take advantage of that, with market share wins, for customers that we strengthen relationships throughout last year as we work with them and we are flexible. And I think that we've got improvements there that should pay dividends for the long run. And those customers are going to increasingly give us business, we think, and some that has historically had been more price-sensitive now have seen our ability to respond with them and give them capacity in a challenge time and to give them service. And maybe it's proved too many customers that, you may pay a little bit more upfront, but the total cost of transportation service, when selecting Old Dominion, can save a company money in the long run. So there's multiple factors, but at the end of the day, it goes back to the fact that we have a service advantage and a capacity advantage and those two factors are unique and have been the basis for why we've been able to grow market share, more than anyone else in our industry over the past 10 years. It's about 56% on the direct side and so our overhead cost, now, or kind of we've talked about those cost over the long run, have been sort of between 20% to 25% of revenue. And so, again, kind of, getting back to the quality of that revenue performance, we were able to move that number back down to lower end of that range. So, something we'll just continue to build on. Those bonuses are kind of split, obviously, more heavily to -- on the direct side, but for management and non-productive labor and meaning, drivers, dock workers and our mechanics, those cost we put more on the overhead side. And so, there's an element of that bonus that would therefore be split into overhead as well, but the majority of it's going to be on the direct side. We're -- like I mentioned, we're at 1625-pounds and I think when we've been in strong environments from strong demand backdrops. We've been around a 1600-pound average in the past. Certainly, you can go back and look at 2018 and that was around the range we were in then. So I think it can stay in this 1600 to maybe 1650 kind of range as we progress through the year and certainly we'd see some ups and downs.  But I think that like I mentioned, we're continuing to see good performance with our smaller customers and they are naturally going to have a little bit lower weight per shipment, so that will bring it down. But just the overall demand environment I think is keeping all shipments a little bit stronger from a weight perspective. I don't think we're really getting flooded, if you will with spillover-type freight. When I look through it, the business we have with third-party logistics companies, a lot of time with our capacity constraints in the market they're able to go out and find and help their customers who are also our customers find capacity. And certainly, we've seen a little bit higher weight per shipment growth with business is controlled by the 3PLs then the rest of our book of business if you will.  So I would expect it to stay in that sort of elevated range just given all the favorable economic backdrop numbers and then just the fact that we still believe capacity is generally constrained in the industry. I think, it's obviously a threat, no doubt. I mean, if you got to a bad team you improve the players and it's a threat to all the other team, so no doubt. But I think they've got to do it, they've got to pull it off and there is an awful lot that goes into service and we worked awfully hard on it over the years, not only a, to be on time, but all the other things that go into a true service product and I think we do it better than others. And hey, it's out there, it's not rocket science, but they've got to do it. So we'll see how they do."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions.  The OD team delivered strong financial and operating results for the third quarter despite a number of unusual operating challenges related to the effects of the pandemic. After experiencing one of our sharpest ever declines in volumes during the second quarter this year, a sequential increase in volumes during the third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. Through incredibly hard work and dedication, the OD team rose to the challenge and continued to deliver on-time service of 99% while matching our record low cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. We produced record profitability during the third quarter of 2020 by continuing to execute a simple operating plan, which we have described to you many times before. The long-term strategy is focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest in the capacity and technology that our customers demand to support their own initiatives. Superior service also goes beyond on-time and claims-free deliveries. Every member of the OD family understands the value of our service and how critical it is for supporting our yield management initiatives. Our long-term approach to managing yields on an account-by-account basis has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long-term. We believe customers also appreciate our consistent pricing philosophy, which should continue to be a key factor in our ability to win market share over the long-term. With the pricing environment improving, and expectations for rates to rise further in our industry next year, we believe we are at an inflection point where market share wins can accelerate. While most people may look forward to turning the page on 2020, we will work tirelessly to finish this year out strong, and we'll also use the period to prepare for 2021. We believe the domestic economy and customer demand will continue to improve. So we must ensure that we have the necessary elements of capacity to support our anticipated growth. Given our long-term market share opportunities, we intend to steadily invest in equipment and additional service center capacity that should include the opening of several new facilities before the end of the first quarter next year. We will also continue to invest in our most critical asset, our OD family of employees. We are actively hiring additional drivers and platform employees to balance our workforce with growing demand and shipment trends, and we will continue to provide our team with the training, benefits and opportunities to succeed and support our customers. With our unique position in the market and ability to further invest in ourselves, I am confident in our ability to continue to grow profitably while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 0.9% increase from the prior year. We operated very efficiently during the quarter and established new company records for our operating ratio and overall profitability. Our operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5% and earnings per diluted share increased 24.8% to $1.71. Our revenue growth for the third quarter may have been modest, but we were pleased to actually return to a positive trend. The increase reflects a 1.3% increase in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by the 0.6% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. This yield metric as well as overall revenue was negatively affected by the significant decrease in the average price of diesel fuel as well as changes in the mix of our freight. Our underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent during the third quarter, as indicated by the continued strength in our LTL revenue per shipment. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 18.1% as compared to the second quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 15.4%. Following the steep drop in volumes in April that generally resulted from the initial state-at-home orders, our shipment levels have steadily increased above our normal sequential trend. At this point, in October, with almost a week remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 2% to 2.5% as compared to October 2019. Our shipments per day trended in line with normal seasonality, but our weight per shipment is in the 1,570- to 1,600-pound range, which is lower than the third quarter.  While the weight per shipment is still higher on a year-over-year basis as compared to October 2019, the sequential decrease is due to measures we took to limit the number of heavier-weighted LTL shipments in our system as well as improving revenue trends with our smaller customer accounts that generally have a lower weight per shipment than a larger national account. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q.  Our third quarter operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5%, with improvement in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We improved the efficiency of our operations and produced increases in our laden load average, P&D shipments per hour and platform shipments per hour when compared to the third quarter of 2019. While we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth quarter, as Greg mentioned, we believe we can effectively balance our labor-to-revenue trend in line with the normal sequential change in this expense line item by continuing to focus on productivity. We will also maintain our disciplined approach to control discretionary spending and make every effort to minimize cost inflation in other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $170.2 million and $686.5 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $46.3 million and $166.5 million for the same periods. We paid $17.6 million of cash dividends to our shareholders during the third quarter, and returned $360.3 million in total capital to shareholders during the first 9 months of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total includes $306.8 million of share repurchases and $53.5 million in cash dividends. There were effectively no share repurchases made during the third quarter due to the 6-month accelerated share repurchase agreement we executed in May. We recorded the initial delivery of shares in the second quarter, and the remaining unsettled shares will be delivered in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 24.8% as compared to 24.9% in the third quarter of 2019. Our rate in the third quarter benefited from certain discrete tax adjustments, and we currently expect our effective tax rate to be 25.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go first to Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: So Adam, you mentioned weight per shipment lower sequentially, still up a little bit year-over-year. I was just wondering, is there a weight per shipment that you're targeting to optimize the revenue quality and margins? And also, are you starting to see any spillover freight from tight truckload capacity? And is that -- are those some of the shipments that you're turning away?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I don't think that there's necessarily an optimal weight per shipment. Certainly, we've tended to average in better periods around the 1,600-pound mark, and we can trend down closer to 1,550 pounds, and that still be fine, too. Some of the lower watermarks like we hit in kind of August of last year, was about 1,530 pounds, that's generally when the economy may not be as strong and that kind of went hand-in-hand with some of the slowdown that we had seen in the industrial market last year. But we're still pleased. I mean, right now, it's kind of around -- between the 1,570- and 1,600-pound range, and that's good. We were starting to see some heavier weighted shipments coming in, particularly off the west coast, some really just large transactional business that we wanted to make sure we weren't getting overrun with and to try to keep the network in balance as well. So we took some internal measures there to try to limit, not necessarily exclude all, but to limit some of those shipments kind of around the system. And so that's why it's trending a little bit lower. In September, the average was 1,617 pounds, so it had been moving back closer to that 1,600-pound mark. And there's a couple of good trends in there. Our smaller mom-and-pop customers are starting to -- the revenue is coming back. Initially in the pandemic, we had stronger performance with our larger national accounts. Our top 50 accounts continue to perform very well. But starting to see some of those smaller accounts come back. And I think once we get at the election and some of the uncertainty that's out there, hopefully, we'll see those continue to trend even more favorably as we transition into '21.\nAllison Landry: Okay. And then I know you talked about the environment currently being conducive to accelerating market share gains, and it sounds like you're more active on the hiring front. But could you sort of walk us through how you expect headcount trends to materialize in Q4? It sounded like maybe up a little bit sequentially, but do you think it'll still be down year-over-year?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that it will -- typically, on a sequential basis, the average change in headcount in the fourth quarter is about 2% higher than the third quarter. And when you look back at some periods like 2017, for example, that number was about 4% higher sequentially. And we were going through a similar period then with volumes really starting to accelerate. So we certainly could see that number kind of being around that 4%. There's no magic number. We're basically just as we go around the system trying to figure out where we need people and to keep things balanced. We may have noticed that we used a little bit of purchase transportation, a little bit more than normal in the third quarter. That was up 20 or 30 basis points. And that's some of how we manage when you get a surge in shipments like we saw when we didn't have all the people in the right places. We can certainly go to that purchase transportation market. But with truckload rates like they are now, certainly, we want to -- we would rather have the employees and our own equipment and continue to manage our domestic line haul network 100% in-house like we historically have, and we only use that extra PT when absolutely necessary because that's where I think we get the advantage from a claims standpoint. By having that total control, we can control that service element to our business. And certainly, that's critical to our value proposition and being able to continue the trend of what we've produced historically. So we're going to make sure that we keep adding the people where necessary to keep up with current demand trends, but also for expectations for a positive growth environment in '21. So it's critical that we get all the people in place. We've certainly got the equipment, and we'll be addressing our equipment and our service center needs with our '21 CapEx plan. But that people piece of the equation right now is important. And given the effects of the pandemic, it's not something that you can solve quickly. It takes a little bit more time to process and onboard drivers, in particular. And so that's something that we just want to make sure that we can catch up and try to get ahead of the demand curve, if we will.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Just a couple of questions. Just following up on the driver headcount front. Obviously, in the truckload sector, they talk a lot about drivers being difficult to come by. I'm just curious, your experience in the LTL world on driver headcount.\nGreg Gantt: Jordan, great question. They are hard to come by. They're a little more difficult to find now than they have been in the past. But we're having success, as Adam mentioned. Since the pandemic, it's a little bit harder to onboard people than it used to be because of some of the issues and some of the government offices and that kind of thing. We're not getting records, checks back as timely as we're used to. Just some of the things that you do to process a driver are taking a little bit longer than we're used to, but we're able to find drivers. Again, just not always at the speed that we'd like to find them. But so far, so good, but it definitely takes an effort. We're still able to hire some competitors. And I think that's a good thing that certainly has helped us over time. So we'll continue to do what we need to do to keep our service center staffed and ready to go.\nJordan Alliger: All right. That's helpful. And then just one other quick one. Can you touch a little bit more on some of these other -- the expense side, the operating supplies, general supplies, et cetera? I'll continue to track on the second quarter and now the third quarter at a very good run rate relative to normal as a percentage of sales, I'm just curious, is this -- are these sort of general supply, other OpEx expenses, can they stay muted? Or do they have to come back over time as well as the labor?\nAdam Satterfield: I think some of those, just collectively, when you talk about the general supplies and expenses and depreciation, those all kind of fall in the general overhead bucket, if you will. And that would include -- the other big component is a piece of the salary, wages and benefits, our salaried employees and clerical and so forth. But all of those dollars, that's been an area that we've talked about from the first to the second quarter.  We certainly saved on dollars in the aggregate due to active measures that we took. But sequentially, we had, from the first quarter to the second quarter, some inflation and those aggregate expenses as a percent of revenue. But with the improvement in revenue, we actually were able to generate some improvement there. So in the second quarter of this year, those costs in aggregate were about 24% of revenue. They were a little over 21% here in the third quarter. So the improvement in revenue certainly helped. The total dollars were about the same that we spent. And that's just ongoing cost control measures that we've got in place. Certainly, as we start transitioning into '21, it's kind of a matter of when some of those costs will return something such as some of our marketing programs, customer entertainment, travel by our sales personnel. We want to be able to restart those measures. Our sales team has done a phenomenal job having to play the hand that they're dealt right now. Staying in front of our customers, continuing to communicate, talk about customer challenges and customer opportunities as well. But certainly, it's not as effective when they're out making personal sales calls and having face-to-face meeting. So we'd like to see that be restored and happily would pay that cost, but that's one of those things that we simply have no idea when it will be safe to really be able to fully restore those programs. So measures like that will come back in due time. But certainly, we'd expect to have a much higher revenue base when those are restored as well. And we've historically seen our overhead costs kind of average between 20% to 25%. And coming back to being closer to 21% -- 21%, 21.5% of revenue here in the third quarter. Certainly, it's a function of cost control, some revenue recovery, but just continuing to be disciplined there and trying to keep those overhead costs as low as a percent of revenue as we can will always be our focus going forward.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Congratulations on a great quarter here. So Adam, maybe if I could just kind of think about the third quarter to fourth quarter seasonality here. Typically, it's about 170 basis points or so of sequential deterioration. You talked about needing to staff up on the headcount side. Obviously, it's such an unusual year in terms of how this year has progressed. Do you think that we'll see something more in line with normal seasonality this year? Or given all these different factors here, should we think about it being one way or the other, maybe a little bit worse than normal seasonality or maybe a little bit better? Just can you kind of help us think through that for a moment?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly, I think the way we'll be looking at it is we'll look at kind of that normal sequential trend. And then just sort of compare and contrast there. I think that with revenue trends that we think can continue, certainly not at the strength of the recovery and the surge we saw in the third quarter. But with positive revenue trends continuing, that certainly gives us a helping hand, if you will.  The average -- we've got several outliers when you just look at a simple 10- or 5-year average over time. But it's usually about a 200-basis-point increase. And the fourth quarter can include things like we have an annual actuarial assessment, and we rebase a couple of the insurance-type liabilities, and that can go one way or the other on us. And so when you throw out some of those outliers, I think that 200 basis point kind of change will be sort of what we measure against. But as you know, we're always looking to try to do better. And if we can outperform a little bit on a revenue basis, then certainly that will win to help in hand. I think that in the third quarter some of the costs that we saw will go away temporarily in the second. A big cost element was -- were things like our group health and dental costs. Those kind of restored to normal, and frankly, we're a little bit higher when we look at our fringe benefit rate as a percent of revenue. The group health and dental costs were a little bit higher than what that normal rate has been. And as a result, that fringe rate was a little bit higher than normal. So I think that there's some catch-up on some cost items. So there's some puts and takes going both ways, and we'll just look to try to balance those. But we did want to say that -- I said it in the prepared comments, that I think that the biggest cost element that we have is the salaries, wages and benefits. And certainly, we're going to continue to keep our focus, one, on providing the very best service in our industry. And I'm really proud of what we achieved, continuing to deliver in the third quarter with historic low, matching our cargo claims ratio at 0.1% and continue to deliver 99%. But I think that we can keep that 200 basis point change kind of about 150 basis points, is the typical change in that salaries, wages and benefit. So if we can manage that kind of in line with normal seasonality, and I think we can. Then certainly, some of those other cost elements will be more a function of revenue trends, if you will, from the third to the fourth quarter.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Okay. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And so I guess for my follow-up question here, I don't want to put you guys on the spot, but I've been getting this question this morning from some investors. But when you kind of think about the long-term goal has always been sort of a 25% incremental margin for your business, when we think about this quarter, in particular, you guys had, obviously, a 25.5% operating margin for the quarter. So it kind of feels like we're maybe pushing into a new frontier. Has there been any change to how you guys are thinking about the incremental margin potential of the business as we sort of look forward? Or is 25% still the right number to use?\nAdam Satterfield: I think what we've said maybe a couple of years ago was 25% was kind of our long-term goal. And that would imply working towards a 75% operating ratio. When we achieve that goal, then we'd kind of update the internal number, if you will. And that doesn't mean that we certainly can't do better than that in a quarterly period. And I think we certainly can, and we've proven it in the past.  And when you think about our cost structure, with sort of 2/3 or around there of our costs being variable. If we can continue to manage those variable costs and produce leverage on those fixed costs, then we can produce some really strong numbers. But until we achieve the 75% annual operating ratio, and I think we'll keep that goal out there. And then we'll update it and start thinking about sort of what's next. But what we feel is a lot of confidence on the ability to continue to improve the operating ratio even further. We know we've got opportunity of just continuing to execute on a basic plan. And to achieve long-term operating ratio improvement, it's a focus on density and yield. And certainly, the density piece of that has been a challenge this year. But when you look at some of our operating metrics, despite the significant changes from first to second and then second to third, we've met those challenges, operated very efficiently and been able to control our costs. So we've done all the things there. But that yield piece is critically important as well. And just having a long-term consistent approach that is focused on outperforming our cost inflation that's led to -- and helped us improve the operating ratio over the long-term. So there's certainly -- we feel confident saying that we can continue to beat it. We'll have some quarters where we might be 35% or even up to 40%. We've done some of those numbers in the past. And certainly, the cost structure has improved when you think about our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So that creates an even stronger opportunity for us as we move forward. But we're not going to let that be a limiting factor either. We don't necessarily focus on incremental margins internally. What we're focused on is producing long-term profitable growth. And so to achieve the market share opportunities that we think are out there in front of us, it requires investments and doing things that create some cost. And so we're going to continue to make all the necessary investments we need to make and try to continue the string of the long-term profitable growth we've been able to deliver because that ultimately leads to increased shareholder value.\nOperator: We'll go next to David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Adam, I just want to talk a little bit more about, I guess, the employee side because the labor efficiencies is where you've shown the most leverage. 6 months ago, 10 months ago, you guys were already very lean. So I guess, where did you cut -- how did you -- how were you able to move the amount of freight that you're moving now with fewer people? What was -- what was the fact that you found that may not have been apparent?\nGreg Gantt: Dave, some of that fat was not necessarily in our productive labor, but in some of our supervision, clerical and the different areas, not just necessarily productive, drivers, dock and those folks. But we found some -- when things got really tight, we found some things that we were able to manage without, and we made the necessary -- what we felt like were necessary cuts at the time. We have not added all of those folks back by any means. Some things have changed, and we have not needed that additional labor that we were able to reduce back in the spring, back in April and May. So now we -- every location is a little bit different. The means are a little bit different by location. But now we do have some needs that we're continuing to feel to ramp back up just to make sure we're staffed. And as Adam had mentioned before, and as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, trying to prepare for '21, which we expect to be pretty robust and promising year. So we'll continue that ramp up as needed.\nDavid Ross: And Greg, you mentioned also investing in technology that customers demand to support their initiatives. Can you give us some examples of what that is? And has that also allowed you to be more productive from a labor efficiency standpoint?\nGreg Gantt: In some cases, David, it has. But for the most part, the biggest thing that customers are looking for is feedback on their shipments. They want to know where it is and how do they get it, how do they get it quicker. And those are the things that we continue to try to work on the communication, shipment communication, the feedback that we get from our customers, the information that we get back from them in order to provide quicker tracing and better information, better -- so they can better plan and so we can better plan. So it's a 2-way street from that standpoint. But we're continuing to focus and work on those things, and they are definitely starting to help us.\nAdam Satterfield: That's definitely helping. So thank you very much, David.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChristian Wetherbee: I was curious about the revenue per day cadence from September to October. I guess I'm trying to get a sense of -- you talked about weight per shipment a little bit in the fluctuation there. Maybe you get a sense of what's going on, on the pricing side or the revenue per hundredweight side to get a sense of how mix and kind of core pricing are impacting that as well?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. I mean, the yields are going to continue. Certainly, if you're looking at revenue per hundredweight with the shipment sizes, weight per shipment decreasing a little bit. That certainly would cause the revenue per hundredweight to increase slightly as well. So that's been a strong number, I think, when you look at the sequential increase in our yield metrics from the second to the third. Just looking at it on a hundredweight basis, I think that certainly some of the mix impacted things; the higher weight per shipment in the third, a little bit longer length of haul as well. That's certainly contributing. But that will continue. And we feel like some of the feedback we're hearing is that yields are continuing to increase in the industry as well. And a lot of times, what you'll see is, especially some of our competitors that use a little bit more purchase transportation and truckload services to run some of their internal line haul, certainly will start facing cost inflation when the truckload rates are inflecting as positive as they are right now. And that's typically a good thing that creates historically an inflection point where we start seeing really a higher need or a need rather for higher rates for our competitors that are offsetting those costs as their cost inflation is increasing. And so that's supportive of our ongoing yield initiatives internally as well as it usually will create some freight opportunity for us as well when that piece of cost for our competitors is increasing certainly much faster than what our cost inflation would look like. So those are a couple of good trends that we feel positive about as we start thinking about finishing out 2020 and then turning the page to '21.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And I guess you talked about inflection points in the prepared remarks and also in the answer to my question. So thinking about market share opportunities as maybe you sort of cross over into 2021, you guys have always done a good job growing in excess of the market. But can you give us maybe some bigger picture thoughts on sort of LTL industry growth opportunities and then what your opportunity is within that and maybe sort of frame it in the context of next year or the year after? Just want to get a sense of sort of how you're still seeing that opportunity, how big it is?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. When you look at that LTL, it has been growing faster than just general GDP. And we think that the industry overall will continue to see good growth. And I think that there are some longer-term tailwinds at play with things like, for example, the e-commerce trends that are pushing more retail-related freight into the system. And right now, we're seeing good trends with the retailers. And it's different to manage that type of freight than certainly some of the -- our legacy industrial-related business, which is still 55% to 60% of our revenue. But certainly, it's been nice to have a good mix of retail-related business that performed pretty strong for us, particularly in the second quarter when everything else was really weak. So that's a trend that I think will continue to be a tailwind for LTL, creating smaller shipment sizes as fulfillment centers continue to be built closer to population areas and shipment sizes more conducive to LTL versus truckload. But I think it gets back to -- right now, capacity may not be as big of a factor at least this year, going through some of the weakness that the overall market has seen. But when you get back to the long-term trend that we've been talking about before the pandemic effect, we've been consistently investing in real estate capacity, growing our network and building out the doors to process freight. And that's what's required in the LTL space, the door capacity is very critical and certainly could be a limiting factor to growth, and it's why we stay or try to stay so far ahead of the demand curve there. And there really hasn't been at least a significant change in the number of service centers and the other public carriers when you look over a longer period of time. Certainly, some have added to their systems and grown in different areas and whatnot. But nevertheless, I think we've been one of the biggest winners for market share in some cases because we continue to invest and have the capacity. So we have a service advantage by offering best-in-class service. We have a capacity advantage, and we think that will continue to play in our favor as the market continues to recover. We've certainly seen some improving trends. I think that some of our industrial customers will continue to improve. ISM and some things like that have certainly been positive the last couple of months. But I don't think we're anywhere near full recovery for most manufacturers and -- manufacturing type businesses, as they've not been as strong as some of our retailers. So those will -- those customers will continue to recover. I think we'll continue to see favorable trends with the retail-related business as well, and all that can kind of come together, hopefully, for us as we transition into '21.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: So just maybe as a follow-up from that question. Can you just give us a sense into what your customer conversations are like right now? I mean, clearly, the LTL market is super tight. There's a long way to go in the demand cycle. Are your customers looking ahead to 2021? And are they panicking? Do you see kind of RFP contract negotiations coming forward? Kind of how are you thinking about the timing of the next GRI based on what your customers are you right now?\nGreg Gantt: Yes, Ravi, I'd expect that we would take our next increase pretty much annually like we typically do. Typically, it's a year out, and I would expect next spring that we would take our typical seasonal increase based on our cost and how they are trending, which we will look at closer to that time. But there has been, and I think we mentioned it earlier, there has been a lot of demand for the bigger shipments, particularly, as Adam mentioned, off the West Coast. We've seen that, which certainly changes how you respond to customers' needs and whatnot. We're not a truckload carrier. And if you're not careful, sometimes when the demand changes like it being this -- early this fall, when you start to see those things, you have to make some adjustments, which we did. So I think customers are certainly what we can tell, they're positive going into next year. Again, the pandemic, I think, has some impact on that. But as we continue to recover and hopefully positively so, I think we'll certainly go into '21 with big expectations, and certainly what we're aiming towards at this point.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And just kind of on that, again, if you just give us a little bit of a framework on what big expectations mean. I mean, typically, your GRI is in the mid-single-digit range. Will you be pushing for double digits?\nAdam Satterfield: I think we've got a long-term approach, Ravi, that we look at our cost inflation every year. And then we sit across the table from our customers and talk about what our costs, how they're changing and then what we need in terms of rate. And certainly, the way we really manage the business is looking at customer profitability on an account-by-account basis. So there may be some customer accounts that we'll have to maybe be more aggressive with. And then there's other long-term customer accounts that may go into the equation that be a little bit lower than the average.  So it just kind of depends on each customer situation, and we'll look at those. But we've been pretty consistent the last few years with a general rate increase of around 5%. And then that kind of becomes the proxy for what we talk to customers on average. About for the need, and we've been successful in achieving our contractual increases throughout this year. But that kind of gets back to the heart of the true customer relationship that you have. And our industry is a relationship business. And so it's critical that we continue to talk with our customers and have that 2-way open and honest communication about things. And certainly, we're willing to do that, and it makes more sense when you can have a cost-based discussion versus the industry is tight and we need a double-digit increase this year. And the industry is loose this year, so we're going to give you some of that back next year and the rollercoaster ride that maybe some customers go on with when they make a decision other than select an Old Dominion. But we're really proud of kind of these long-term customer relationships that we have, and certainly, we think that will continue. And next year, just looking out, certainly, that's kind of the 4% to 5%. When you look at our long-term revenue per shipment, we've kind of averaged really between 4.5% and 5%, and that's been 75 to 100 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And we've already established a 3% wage increase that went into effect the 1st of September. So that's a big element of our cost inflation every year. And has been pretty consistent as well. So we already know some of those factors, and that'll kind of frame things up for us. But we'll look. And the yield numbers themselves, some of it will really depend. There's going to be some weird comparisons as we transition into next year with weight per shipment that might make your revenue per hundredweight look a little bit stronger than maybe that 5% type of number. So we'll just have to balance all of those. But underlying contract and general rate increase, I would expect that we'll see it kind of consistent with what our long-term trends have been.\nRavi Shanker: That's great color. If I can just sneak in 1 follow-up to that. Kind of the 1 area, which I think you may not have mentioned is fuel. Obviously, kind of we appear to be in an environment of like prolonged subdued fuel prices. And in the past, the fuel surcharge has been a nice boost to your yield metrics. Do you feel like you need to change your go-to-market strategy or maybe change some of the formulas and how the fuel yield -- the fuel surcharge is calculated there?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, we've been dealing with fuel that's been down 20% or more. And that's what it was down in this most recent quarter, and we produced a 74.5% operating ratio. So I think when we balance that fuel contribution with the overall yield, that's just a variable component of pricing. And it's something that we continue to look at. And as a contract turns over, we look at the fuel base. But I think that we've been pretty successful with our fuel strategy really over the last couple of years. It's been several years ago, where when fuel first really took a big drop that maybe the low end of our scale wasn't appropriate, and we waited a little time to go back to some of our customers and have to make some changes on that. So as long as fuel continues to stay consistent, it doesn't really go much lower, we'd like to see it come back a little bit because that certainly helps the top line number. But we're going to be -- if fuel continues to stay in this range where it is, around $2.40 a gallon, that's -- it's going to be down in the fourth quarter. That would be down in the first quarter and really be the second quarter of next year before it kind of comes back to par, that was when fuel started dropping in 2Q of this year. So we'll see. It'd be nice if it was a little bit higher because certainly that optically make our revenue numbers. When we come in every day and we look at what the revenue from the previous day was, and when we look at the revenue, we can say growth now. But looking at it with and without the fuel, without the fuel certainly looks much stronger, and it'd be nice if that was the overall number, but you play the hand that you're dealt, and that's what we'll continue to do.\nGreg Gantt: Positive side of that, Ravi, is obviously, we don't need high fuel prices to produce a record low OR. So I think that's the positive side of that.\nOperator: We'll go next to Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Quickly when you look at the surge in freight that we've seen that came on in the summer, what are your customers telling you in terms of where it's coming from? I mean, clearly, there's been some restocking, but there is some underlying demand. I'm just curious what they're saying. How strong is this going to be and for how long?\nAdam Satterfield: Certainly, when you look at inventory levels overall, they continue to be low and so I think that some of that will continue, but the consumer continues to consume. And I think that people are spending money in different ways. And you get down to it, that's still 70% to 80% of the overall economy. So as people continue to purchase things and there's got to be the production of those things and ultimate delivery and positioning for them to be able to buy them. So certainly, there's been some obvious changes in the retail landscape related to the pandemic and probably have seen e-commerce growth probably pulled forward a couple of years at least in terms of the change of e-commerce in terms of total retail sales. So that's been something that, as we talked about before, it creates some opportunity for the LTL industry. That's certainly not an overnight kind of phenomenon, and you don't build fulfillment centers overnight, but that's something that's certainly continuing to change, and we think we can benefit from. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure. But hinted at earlier, there's certainly some operational challenges that come along with managing more that freight and balancing, you're right, equipment pools and just the service demands can be different as well. So we've got to make sure that we keep all of that balanced as we flex and see more growth with our retail-related business.  But I think that certainly, we can see those trends continue and take advantage because the other big piece of that retail-related growth on the e-commerce side is the demand for superior service is even greater. As they're managing inventory levels, and inventory is tight, then certainly you can't afford to. And in many cases, when you deliver into many of the big-box retailers that have got programs in place that that will have penalties for vendors if their carriers aren't delivering on time and in full. Certainly, when you make the selection of choose an Old Dominion, we're going to deliver on time 99% of the time and our damages as a percent of revenue of 0.1%. So we certainly can meet that demand and service expectation for our customers and help them avoid charges down the line where the total cost of service is cheaper for them, even though they might pay a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion.\nJason Seidl: That's good color. I have a follow-up on technology. I mean, you guys have always been at the forefront investing in technology, going back in my 20-plus years of covering you. How should we look at Old Dominion in their foray into potential alternative fuel-type or alternative-technology trucks? Is this something you're looking at?\nGreg Gantt: Certainly, Jason. We always try to stay in the forefront of any type of new equipment that's out there. I think we've talked about this in one of the prior calls, but we're looking at and exploring electric vehicles and that kind of thing. But Jason, honestly, right now, nobody has a production, any type of a production of electric vehicle. They're just -- we're just not there yet. I'm sure they've come a time, and we'll progress as the technology and the opportunities for that progress. But right now, they're just not out there and available. So we certainly have to balance all that from a cost standpoint and everything else. But they're -- I'm sure that's going to be a big thing as we go forward. But right now, they're just not production vehicles out there to be had to run in our system. There's lots of issues, lots of poles left to climb, if you will. And again, I'm sure we'll get there, but just not there yet.\nJason Seidl: So it feels like we're a couple of years away then?\nGreg Gantt: I think so.\nOperator: We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Adam, on your comments regarding the cost structure, especially on the overhead side, I guess that implies direct costs or variable costs of 53% to 53.5% of revenues. Do you think you can hold the line on that, I guess, variable piece of the cost structure in 4Q in terms of percentage of revenue? Or is there anything that may drive, I guess, a bit of the match between how that's evolved versus shipments has actually been quite close. I'm just wondering if there's any perspective mismatch there between variable costs and shipments that we should think about as you go into the fourth quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I mean, that's the -- we were talking earlier about some of the labor costs and that salary, wages and benefits line. It's typically where that normal sequential deterioration in the operating ratio that's about 200 basis points. The majority of that comes from the salary, wages and benefits line. And most of those costs are going to be our productive labor cost. So we'll see how that balances as we transition. Typically, like I said, you'd see that inflate a little bit, and we're certainly going to do what we can and believe that we can keep those costs kind of in line with what that normal sequential trend will be. And some of it will just depend on kind of what the revenue base and how that trends through the fourth quarter compared to where we just were in the third. So -- but that will have more of an impact really on some of those more fixed types of costs.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. And then just related to that, I guess, on the overhead side, I'd love for you to comment on the long-term opportunity there. Obviously, there's excess capacity on the line haul network and the density opportunities there. I mean, in 3, 4, 5 years, assuming no major change, I guess, in the growth and how the mix of revenue is trending. Could we be looking at 17% to 18% overhead, just as you guys continue to leverage the line haul? And then the last one I had is just -- if you could just provide a little bit more color around September tonnage. That's obviously important between the breakdown between shipments and weight per shipment on a year-over-year basis. I don't know if you can help us with that in terms of how the quarter ended in September.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. In terms of the long-term where overhead costs might go, we've just -- over the long run, we've seen those costs trend between that 20% to 25% type of range. And the reason for that is really what our market share opportunities are for the long-term. And we feel like we've got a really long runway for continued growth there, which will require continued investment in assets. And so as we continue to invest, certainly, that depreciation line will continue to stay more as a bigger component, if you will, versus getting to the point where there's not growth left, and you can create leverage on that. So we feel good about what the market share opportunities are and continuing to look at investing 10% to 15% of our revenues back into our CapEx programs every year that that will then drive the increase in depreciation. Some of those overhead costs, too, are more variable in nature. There are some elements that are bad debt expense. There's some performance-based compensation that's in there. There's other things that are more variable. So that 20% to 25%, maybe 5% to 8% of revenue is kind of more variable in nature that that's sort of within that overall element. So those will obviously continue to increase. But certainly, there's going to be opportunities out there. And we certainly are always looking to do what we can to minimize those costs. But what that means over the long run is that the improvement in the operating ratio has come out of our direct cost. And you referenced line haul a couple of times, and we put line haul, that's a direct operating expense. And there's a fixed nature of running our line haul operations. And when we add new service centers, sometimes that creates a little inefficiency on the line haul side, but it drives efficiency within our pickup/delivery operations because we're now putting our pickup/delivery workforce, if you will, closer to our customers and minimizing the time to our first stop. And so there's different trade-offs as we continue to grow and add to the overall footprint. But I think that certainly, there's opportunities for us to continue to be efficient there and drive further efficiencies. When you sort of break down our operations, we're at about 240 service centers now. When you look at the available capacity that we have in the network, that's the opportunity, whereas we increase density in one particular service center, that helps that service center's operating ratio. And when you're doing that across the spectrum of those 240, it's only the few that you're adding depreciation to every year where you're causing the operating ratio maybe to go the opposite direction. But you've got a bigger pool that they're working on some type of improvement program. And that's really at the heart of why we've got confidence in saying we can continue to drive the operating ratio even lower than where it is today.\nAmit Mehrotra: Can you address the September question as well on the breakdown between shipment, weight per shipment and shipments?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I thought with that long-winded response, you might forget about that one, but with September, let's see, so the overall -- do you want the year-over-year for September?\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, if you're going to give me both, I'll take the year-over-year and sequential, that would be great.\nAdam Satterfield: Okay. So for weight, year-over-year tonnage was up 3.6%. And then sequentially, September's tonnage was up 4.3% over August. On the shipment side, the shipments per day were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. So compared to September of last year, shipments in September on a sequential basis were up 4.6% versus August.\nOperator: We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Adam, just on the comments around the network growth into '21. I guess, first to start, can you share roughly where you think the available capacity is in the network? And then second, as you think about what you're targeting, is it mostly on the door side? Or is it on rolling stock? And is there anything we need to think about on the cost side? I think it was 2018 maybe where you grew the fleet a little bit in advance of the tonnage growth and the depreciation was out a little bit ahead. Is the thought in '21 that you could see a similar dynamic? Or would it be maybe a little bit better matched with the tonnage coming into the network?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. The overall capacity of the service in a network is probably between 25% and 30% now. We've gotten above that 30% threshold when things really weakened. And I think we're kind of back in that type of range now, which is good for us, especially as we transition to next year. But as Greg mentioned earlier, we've got several facilities that we think will be opening just between now and the end of the first quarter. So I think that we'll see some openings in '21, but there will also be some facilities that we either just expand or we move into a larger facility and out of another one. Much of the investment will be continuing to add out in some of our larger metro areas where we may add a second, third, fourth or fifth facility. I think that there's tremendous market share opportunity there. We've seen that play out in the Midwest, in particular, which is the largest LTL market. And so I think that certainly, we've got opportunities there. And then we'll continue to look at where we have density for end of the line type of locations and can add a facility in a market that -- just like I was talking about earlier, that can help us in reducing some of our pickup/delivery cost as well just by getting out closer to our customers. But we generally want to make sure that there's enough freight opportunity and density there to support an operation in the market. On the other side and the other pieces, certainly, we've got equipment capacity right now. I think that we haven't finalized our CapEx. We'll give that on next quarter's call. But we had a bit of a holiday this year because of the overinvestment in equipment in '18 and '19. This year, we only spent $20 million on equipment. So I think that we'll see that number kind of get back to more of a normalized type of range, and we expect to see the overall CapEx kind of back in that 10% to 15% range, but probably towards the upper end of that.  But we've still got some things to finalize as we kind of transition through the fourth quarter and really get to the point of putting orders in place. But with all that said, I think that typically, we can create, and especially if we get into a really strong revenue growth environment, we can create leverage there and be able to offset those costs. And that kind of just goes back into maybe the incremental margin conversation we were having earlier. We certainly, I think, can produce some strong incrementals, but a lot of it will be dependent on the good expectations for next year. And we're still having conversations with customers as we're building up our forecast for next year and from a bottoms-up and a top-down basis. And there's still some uncertainty, obviously, hanging out there that we'll see it may change some people's minds next week based on the results of the election.\nTodd Fowler: Yes. Well definitely in Ohio we're seeing tuned on that one. That's for sure. So, just on my follow-up, I guess, kind of a bigger picture question, and Jack kind of hit on this with the incremental margin question earlier. But operating at a sub-75% OR here in the third quarter, are there any bigger picture takeaways as you think about the business? I mean you did it in an environment that was pretty volatile. You had purchase transportation that moved up. Tonnage was obviously up a lot sequentially, but not a lot year-over-year. Does it feel like that on a longer-term basis, it's sustainable to operate on a full-year basis at a mid-75 -- or excuse me, mid-70 OR? Or are there other pieces or other things that we need to think about that really contributed to this performance in the quarter that may not be representative of kind of what you can do longer-term?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think we've talked about being able to operate in this type of range on an annualized basis for some time and certainly made a lot of progress this year. Used to kind of say we needed revenue growth to be able to improve the operating ratio, but this environment was so unusual. We had to take immediate and aggressive action to address some of the cost because of how immediate the drop-off in revenue was and just the unavailability of work that was out there back in April. And so it's been good as we transitioned through and saw some of the recovery began back in May when things sort of stabilized and started improving. And we brought back probably about 1,400 employees compared back to April. And so we continue to onboard people to keep up with these demand trends. And -- but have really done a good job in balancing all of our costs. And I think what we've seen in the past in trying to take that forward, as we move into the future, is a lot of times, when you go through a period like this, you do a lot of evaluation of your processes, your people and systems and so forth. And some of the productivity that we saw improvements that we made back in the '08 and '09 timeframe, those carried forward for years to come. And so we certainly expect that some of this improvement in productivity as we transition back into a growth environment and start bringing newer people onboard, we obviously want to maintain these measurements of productivity. And I think that we'll be able to. And so certainly, that's encouraging. That's the biggest piece of the cost structure and the most critical element for us to continue to manage those and other true controllable costs as we transition back into more of a normalized growth environment in terms of what our expectations have been and what we've been able to produce in the past. So we certainly -- again, we've talked about it before, but we believe we can continue to improve the operating ratio. And it's just based on how that model works. If we can continue to improve the network density that generally creates productivity opportunities. And if we continue to be disciplined and have a cost-based type of approach to managing our yields, both of those generally require the positive macro environment to support those initiatives. We've done it when the macro environment wasn't good. But certainly, we think as we transition to more of a positive one, they'll continue to help on those fronts, and we can produce further operating ratio improvement.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: Nice quarter. So my first question, I wanted to talk about -- Greg, you mentioned you think we're at an inflection point on where OD can go in terms of market share. Maybe you could just elaborate on that a little bit. I think Adam talked earlier about some of your competitors seeing some cost pressures rising. But is it really a function of that? Or is it really a function more of kind of what you're seeing in terms of end markets and the conversations you're having with customers? And if so, maybe you could elaborate on where you're seeing some strength in terms of those customer conversations. And then if we think about other periods where OD has really seen a strong operating environment, you've been able to grow tonnage into the double digits. And so maybe you could talk about the extent to which you think that's feasible for 2021, given kind of where you are in terms of resources and what you're looking to add?\nGreg Gantt: Sure. Well, I think, obviously, we're expecting growth next year. We're continuing to -- as Adam had mentioned before, we're continuing to expand our capacity, both from a facilities and an equipment standpoint, and we're in the process of hiring people.  So as you know, those are the components of adding capacity. So we're actually working pretty hard on all 3 fronts at this point in time. But we've seen strength of late, particularly off the West Coast. And I think we've all seen and heard about additional imports that are coming in and how busy the ports are out in that part of the country. And we've seen that particularly out of California. But we've exhibited strength really, for the most part, system-wide, and we certainly expect that next year. For the most part, our customers are extremely positive. Again, Adam mentioned before, what happens next week certainly could have an impact on where we are and where we go. But so far, we're expecting a good year. Obviously, we're spending money like we're expecting a good year. So I think we certainly hope that it continues down that path and we're -- just based on the feedback that we're getting, we're hoping for big things, to hope that makes sense.\nAri Rosa: No, that's -- no, absolutely. That's helpful directionally, certainly. And then just a little bit on minutiae. But the free cash flow number, it looked like the cash from operating activities at about $170 million was a bit below what it has been typically. And so obviously, very strong on the income statement line. But maybe you could talk about what was going on there with the operating cash flow?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, operating cash flow. Well, you've always got some changes in things that maybe are deferred that get paid. But when I think when you look on an overall basis, from a year-to-date standpoint, we produced really solid cash flow from operations. And so I've been pleased with that. But from a quarterly standpoint, could just be the timing effect of some of the deferred taxes that are somewhat related to the CARES Act from -- that was passed earlier this year that helped from some of the payroll taxes and whatnot.  And just some other changes in the timing effect of things. But really strong, I think, cash flow performance, if you will, in terms of kind of where we are. It's probably a little below on a year-to-date basis last year, but overall, it's approaching $700 million of cash from ops this year. So really strong, and we'll continue -- we've got it kind of in-hand to be able to put to work as we think about our CapEx. And as you know, our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our sales, and that the CapEx plan was a little bit lower this year. But a big piece of that was the equipment, as we talked about earlier. So we'll be evaluating that, as we transition next year, but it certainly will probably be a much larger number for CapEx than what we had this year.\nOperator: We'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: A couple of quick ones. The -- so the October rev per day deceleration, is that entirely weight per shipment? Or is there any other piece of that?\nAdam Satterfield: No, it's weight per shipment driven, Scott. Like we mentioned before, the shipments are trending in line in October, and as you know, typically, our business kind of builds up and September is usually the strongest month of the year for us. And so, we saw that again, and those shipments continue to be really strong there. In fact, we're back to about kind of where when we put our forecast together for the beginning of the year back to where we thought we'd be in September but took an unusual route to get there. And you compare September shipment level to March, which is really before things begin to really be affected by the pandemic. We're kind of in line with the normal trend there of kind of you look back over time, where September would be versus March. So we're seeing good trends there. But the October, the shipments per day right in line right now at this point with what the longer-term -- the 10-year average sequential trend would be and -- but just a little bit softer on the weight per shipment side, which is not totally unexpected. We believe that, that would continue to sort of come back as our smaller customers continue to sort of get back to their normalized level. The mix is still slanted a little bit heavier to our larger national accounts than kind of historical trends by a couple of points probably. But nevertheless, those smaller accounts are continuing to perform well and coming back. So that's certainly beneficial. But yield trends continue to be solid, and it's really just a function of that weight per shipment is dropping a little bit on us. But some of that, like we mentioned, was us taking control and getting some of the transactional freight out of our business right now.\nScott Group: But just given your views around share gains, you wouldn't have thought that shipments would be outperforming seasonality now?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, again, I think that when you just look and think about from a customer standpoint and how they're getting freight out, September is going to be the build-up. And when you look over the past 20 years, a normal sequential trend is down about 3%. There's really been only one October in the past 20 years that's been positive versus September. So obviously, we've got a week left in the month, and we're just talking about numbers that aren't finalized, but this is about where, frankly, we thought we would be, and we're managing to. So it's not been a surprise, especially with the fact that, again, we have limited some shipments out of the system. So it would have been slightly better, but very normal and expected to see, even as things were building up that we'd see a little bit of a drop-off in October versus the September trend there. And that's just really a function when you look across the spectrum of all of our customer accounts, the way they're managing their business and their shipment trends and so forth. So not unexpected to see it at all.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just lastly, on the OR. So if you look at most years, the OR is similar with, if not better than, third quarter the prior year. So I guess what I'm trying to say is, it feels like next year should be a year where you can get to that 75% OR, if not better. Do you think we're missing anything there?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean, we're not ready to call next year's operating ratio. But I think that certainly, if revenue plays out like we hope it will, transitioning then that obviously creates an opportunity. We generally, on average, have been produced or improving the operating ratio, 80 to 100 basis points kind of on average each year. And just taking kind of where we are from a year-to-date basis, then obviously we're a little bit better than that at this point than that longer-term trend despite the fact that revenues have been affected like they hadn't been. So we'll see where we end up next year, but we're not ready to give any specific color on it. But certainly, in an improving revenue environment, it makes the ability to improve operating ratio easier than certainly what we've seen and had to deal with this year.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions.  The OD team delivered strong financial and operating results for the third quarter despite a number of unusual operating challenges related to the effects of the pandemic. After experiencing one of our sharpest ever declines in volumes during the second quarter this year, a sequential increase in volumes during the third quarter was one of the strongest in our history. Through incredibly hard work and dedication, the OD team rose to the challenge and continued to deliver on-time service of 99% while matching our record low cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. We produced record profitability during the third quarter of 2020 by continuing to execute a simple operating plan, which we have described to you many times before. The long-term strategy is focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest in the capacity and technology that our customers demand to support their own initiatives. Superior service also goes beyond on-time and claims-free deliveries. Every member of the OD family understands the value of our service and how critical it is for supporting our yield management initiatives. Our long-term approach to managing yields on an account-by-account basis has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long-term. We believe customers also appreciate our consistent pricing philosophy, which should continue to be a key factor in our ability to win market share over the long-term. With the pricing environment improving, and expectations for rates to rise further in our industry next year, we believe we are at an inflection point where market share wins can accelerate. While most people may look forward to turning the page on 2020, we will work tirelessly to finish this year out strong, and we'll also use the period to prepare for 2021. We believe the domestic economy and customer demand will continue to improve. So we must ensure that we have the necessary elements of capacity to support our anticipated growth. Given our long-term market share opportunities, we intend to steadily invest in equipment and additional service center capacity that should include the opening of several new facilities before the end of the first quarter next year. We will also continue to invest in our most critical asset, our OD family of employees. We are actively hiring additional drivers and platform employees to balance our workforce with growing demand and shipment trends, and we will continue to provide our team with the training, benefits and opportunities to succeed and support our customers. With our unique position in the market and ability to further invest in ourselves, I am confident in our ability to continue to grow profitably while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Jordan, great question. They are hard to come by. They're a little more difficult to find now than they have been in the past. But we're having success, as Adam mentioned. Since the pandemic, it's a little bit harder to onboard people than it used to be because of some of the issues and some of the government offices and that kind of thing. We're not getting records, checks back as timely as we're used to. Just some of the things that you do to process a driver are taking a little bit longer than we're used to, but we're able to find drivers. Again, just not always at the speed that we'd like to find them. But so far, so good, but it definitely takes an effort. We're still able to hire some competitors. And I think that's a good thing that certainly has helped us over time. So we'll continue to do what we need to do to keep our service center staffed and ready to go. Dave, some of that fat was not necessarily in our productive labor, but in some of our supervision, clerical and the different areas, not just necessarily productive, drivers, dock and those folks. But we found some -- when things got really tight, we found some things that we were able to manage without, and we made the necessary -- what we felt like were necessary cuts at the time. We have not added all of those folks back by any means. Some things have changed, and we have not needed that additional labor that we were able to reduce back in the spring, back in April and May. So now we -- every location is a little bit different. The means are a little bit different by location. But now we do have some needs that we're continuing to feel to ramp back up just to make sure we're staffed. And as Adam had mentioned before, and as I mentioned in my earlier commentary, trying to prepare for '21, which we expect to be pretty robust and promising year. So we'll continue that ramp up as needed. In some cases, David, it has. But for the most part, the biggest thing that customers are looking for is feedback on their shipments. They want to know where it is and how do they get it, how do they get it quicker. And those are the things that we continue to try to work on the communication, shipment communication, the feedback that we get from our customers, the information that we get back from them in order to provide quicker tracing and better information, better -- so they can better plan and so we can better plan. So it's a 2-way street from that standpoint. But we're continuing to focus and work on those things, and they are definitely starting to help us. Yes. I mean, the yields are going to continue. Certainly, if you're looking at revenue per hundredweight with the shipment sizes, weight per shipment decreasing a little bit. That certainly would cause the revenue per hundredweight to increase slightly as well. So that's been a strong number, I think, when you look at the sequential increase in our yield metrics from the second to the third. Just looking at it on a hundredweight basis, I think that certainly some of the mix impacted things; the higher weight per shipment in the third, a little bit longer length of haul as well. That's certainly contributing. But that will continue. And we feel like some of the feedback we're hearing is that yields are continuing to increase in the industry as well. And a lot of times, what you'll see is, especially some of our competitors that use a little bit more purchase transportation and truckload services to run some of their internal line haul, certainly will start facing cost inflation when the truckload rates are inflecting as positive as they are right now. And that's typically a good thing that creates historically an inflection point where we start seeing really a higher need or a need rather for higher rates for our competitors that are offsetting those costs as their cost inflation is increasing. And so that's supportive of our ongoing yield initiatives internally as well as it usually will create some freight opportunity for us as well when that piece of cost for our competitors is increasing certainly much faster than what our cost inflation would look like. So those are a couple of good trends that we feel positive about as we start thinking about finishing out 2020 and then turning the page to '21. Yes. When you look at that LTL, it has been growing faster than just general GDP. And we think that the industry overall will continue to see good growth. And I think that there are some longer-term tailwinds at play with things like, for example, the e-commerce trends that are pushing more retail-related freight into the system. And right now, we're seeing good trends with the retailers. And it's different to manage that type of freight than certainly some of the -- our legacy industrial-related business, which is still 55% to 60% of our revenue. But certainly, it's been nice to have a good mix of retail-related business that performed pretty strong for us, particularly in the second quarter when everything else was really weak. So that's a trend that I think will continue to be a tailwind for LTL, creating smaller shipment sizes as fulfillment centers continue to be built closer to population areas and shipment sizes more conducive to LTL versus truckload. But I think it gets back to -- right now, capacity may not be as big of a factor at least this year, going through some of the weakness that the overall market has seen. But when you get back to the long-term trend that we've been talking about before the pandemic effect, we've been consistently investing in real estate capacity, growing our network and building out the doors to process freight. And that's what's required in the LTL space, the door capacity is very critical and certainly could be a limiting factor to growth, and it's why we stay or try to stay so far ahead of the demand curve there. And there really hasn't been at least a significant change in the number of service centers and the other public carriers when you look over a longer period of time. Certainly, some have added to their systems and grown in different areas and whatnot. But nevertheless, I think we've been one of the biggest winners for market share in some cases because we continue to invest and have the capacity. So we have a service advantage by offering best-in-class service. We have a capacity advantage, and we think that will continue to play in our favor as the market continues to recover. We've certainly seen some improving trends. I think that some of our industrial customers will continue to improve. ISM and some things like that have certainly been positive the last couple of months. But I don't think we're anywhere near full recovery for most manufacturers and -- manufacturing type businesses, as they've not been as strong as some of our retailers. So those will -- those customers will continue to recover. I think we'll continue to see favorable trends with the retail-related business as well, and all that can kind of come together, hopefully, for us as we transition into '21. Yes, Ravi, I'd expect that we would take our next increase pretty much annually like we typically do. Typically, it's a year out, and I would expect next spring that we would take our typical seasonal increase based on our cost and how they are trending, which we will look at closer to that time. But there has been, and I think we mentioned it earlier, there has been a lot of demand for the bigger shipments, particularly, as Adam mentioned, off the West Coast. We've seen that, which certainly changes how you respond to customers' needs and whatnot. We're not a truckload carrier. And if you're not careful, sometimes when the demand changes like it being this -- early this fall, when you start to see those things, you have to make some adjustments, which we did. So I think customers are certainly what we can tell, they're positive going into next year. Again, the pandemic, I think, has some impact on that. But as we continue to recover and hopefully positively so, I think we'll certainly go into '21 with big expectations, and certainly what we're aiming towards at this point. Positive side of that, Ravi, is obviously, we don't need high fuel prices to produce a record low OR. So I think that's the positive side of that. Certainly, Jason. We always try to stay in the forefront of any type of new equipment that's out there. I think we've talked about this in one of the prior calls, but we're looking at and exploring electric vehicles and that kind of thing. But Jason, honestly, right now, nobody has a production, any type of a production of electric vehicle. They're just -- we're just not there yet. I'm sure they've come a time, and we'll progress as the technology and the opportunities for that progress. But right now, they're just not out there and available. So we certainly have to balance all that from a cost standpoint and everything else. But they're -- I'm sure that's going to be a big thing as we go forward. But right now, they're just not production vehicles out there to be had to run in our system. There's lots of issues, lots of poles left to climb, if you will. And again, I'm sure we'll get there, but just not there yet. I think so. Sure. Well, I think, obviously, we're expecting growth next year. We're continuing to -- as Adam had mentioned before, we're continuing to expand our capacity, both from a facilities and an equipment standpoint, and we're in the process of hiring people.  So as you know, those are the components of adding capacity. So we're actually working pretty hard on all 3 fronts at this point in time. But we've seen strength of late, particularly off the West Coast. And I think we've all seen and heard about additional imports that are coming in and how busy the ports are out in that part of the country. And we've seen that particularly out of California. But we've exhibited strength really, for the most part, system-wide, and we certainly expect that next year. For the most part, our customers are extremely positive. Again, Adam mentioned before, what happens next week certainly could have an impact on where we are and where we go. But so far, we're expecting a good year. Obviously, we're spending money like we're expecting a good year. So I think we certainly hope that it continues down that path and we're -- just based on the feedback that we're getting, we're hoping for big things, to hope that makes sense. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the third quarter of 2020 was $1.1 billion, which was a 0.9% increase from the prior year. We operated very efficiently during the quarter and established new company records for our operating ratio and overall profitability. Our operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5% and earnings per diluted share increased 24.8% to $1.71. Our revenue growth for the third quarter may have been modest, but we were pleased to actually return to a positive trend. The increase reflects a 1.3% increase in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by the 0.6% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. This yield metric as well as overall revenue was negatively affected by the significant decrease in the average price of diesel fuel as well as changes in the mix of our freight. Our underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent during the third quarter, as indicated by the continued strength in our LTL revenue per shipment. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 18.1% as compared to the second quarter of 2020, while LTL shipments per day increased 15.4%. Following the steep drop in volumes in April that generally resulted from the initial state-at-home orders, our shipment levels have steadily increased above our normal sequential trend. At this point, in October, with almost a week remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 2% to 2.5% as compared to October 2019. Our shipments per day trended in line with normal seasonality, but our weight per shipment is in the 1,570- to 1,600-pound range, which is lower than the third quarter.  While the weight per shipment is still higher on a year-over-year basis as compared to October 2019, the sequential decrease is due to measures we took to limit the number of heavier-weighted LTL shipments in our system as well as improving revenue trends with our smaller customer accounts that generally have a lower weight per shipment than a larger national account. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q.  Our third quarter operating ratio improved 480 basis points to 74.5%, with improvement in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We improved the efficiency of our operations and produced increases in our laden load average, P&D shipments per hour and platform shipments per hour when compared to the third quarter of 2019. While we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the fourth quarter, as Greg mentioned, we believe we can effectively balance our labor-to-revenue trend in line with the normal sequential change in this expense line item by continuing to focus on productivity. We will also maintain our disciplined approach to control discretionary spending and make every effort to minimize cost inflation in other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $170.2 million and $686.5 million for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2020, respectively, while capital expenditures were $46.3 million and $166.5 million for the same periods. We paid $17.6 million of cash dividends to our shareholders during the third quarter, and returned $360.3 million in total capital to shareholders during the first 9 months of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total includes $306.8 million of share repurchases and $53.5 million in cash dividends. There were effectively no share repurchases made during the third quarter due to the 6-month accelerated share repurchase agreement we executed in May. We recorded the initial delivery of shares in the second quarter, and the remaining unsettled shares will be delivered in the fourth quarter. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2020 was 24.8% as compared to 24.9% in the third quarter of 2019. Our rate in the third quarter benefited from certain discrete tax adjustments, and we currently expect our effective tax rate to be 25.9% for the fourth quarter of 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Yes. I don't think that there's necessarily an optimal weight per shipment. Certainly, we've tended to average in better periods around the 1,600-pound mark, and we can trend down closer to 1,550 pounds, and that still be fine, too. Some of the lower watermarks like we hit in kind of August of last year, was about 1,530 pounds, that's generally when the economy may not be as strong and that kind of went hand-in-hand with some of the slowdown that we had seen in the industrial market last year. But we're still pleased. I mean, right now, it's kind of around -- between the 1,570- and 1,600-pound range, and that's good. We were starting to see some heavier weighted shipments coming in, particularly off the west coast, some really just large transactional business that we wanted to make sure we weren't getting overrun with and to try to keep the network in balance as well. So we took some internal measures there to try to limit, not necessarily exclude all, but to limit some of those shipments kind of around the system. And so that's why it's trending a little bit lower. In September, the average was 1,617 pounds, so it had been moving back closer to that 1,600-pound mark. And there's a couple of good trends in there. Our smaller mom-and-pop customers are starting to -- the revenue is coming back. Initially in the pandemic, we had stronger performance with our larger national accounts. Our top 50 accounts continue to perform very well. But starting to see some of those smaller accounts come back. And I think once we get at the election and some of the uncertainty that's out there, hopefully, we'll see those continue to trend even more favorably as we transition into '21. I think that it will -- typically, on a sequential basis, the average change in headcount in the fourth quarter is about 2% higher than the third quarter. And when you look back at some periods like 2017, for example, that number was about 4% higher sequentially. And we were going through a similar period then with volumes really starting to accelerate. So we certainly could see that number kind of being around that 4%. There's no magic number. We're basically just as we go around the system trying to figure out where we need people and to keep things balanced. We may have noticed that we used a little bit of purchase transportation, a little bit more than normal in the third quarter. That was up 20 or 30 basis points. And that's some of how we manage when you get a surge in shipments like we saw when we didn't have all the people in the right places. We can certainly go to that purchase transportation market. But with truckload rates like they are now, certainly, we want to -- we would rather have the employees and our own equipment and continue to manage our domestic line haul network 100% in-house like we historically have, and we only use that extra PT when absolutely necessary because that's where I think we get the advantage from a claims standpoint. By having that total control, we can control that service element to our business. And certainly, that's critical to our value proposition and being able to continue the trend of what we've produced historically. So we're going to make sure that we keep adding the people where necessary to keep up with current demand trends, but also for expectations for a positive growth environment in '21. So it's critical that we get all the people in place. We've certainly got the equipment, and we'll be addressing our equipment and our service center needs with our '21 CapEx plan. But that people piece of the equation right now is important. And given the effects of the pandemic, it's not something that you can solve quickly. It takes a little bit more time to process and onboard drivers, in particular. And so that's something that we just want to make sure that we can catch up and try to get ahead of the demand curve, if we will. I think some of those, just collectively, when you talk about the general supplies and expenses and depreciation, those all kind of fall in the general overhead bucket, if you will. And that would include -- the other big component is a piece of the salary, wages and benefits, our salaried employees and clerical and so forth. But all of those dollars, that's been an area that we've talked about from the first to the second quarter.  We certainly saved on dollars in the aggregate due to active measures that we took. But sequentially, we had, from the first quarter to the second quarter, some inflation and those aggregate expenses as a percent of revenue. But with the improvement in revenue, we actually were able to generate some improvement there. So in the second quarter of this year, those costs in aggregate were about 24% of revenue. They were a little over 21% here in the third quarter. So the improvement in revenue certainly helped. The total dollars were about the same that we spent. And that's just ongoing cost control measures that we've got in place. Certainly, as we start transitioning into '21, it's kind of a matter of when some of those costs will return something such as some of our marketing programs, customer entertainment, travel by our sales personnel. We want to be able to restart those measures. Our sales team has done a phenomenal job having to play the hand that they're dealt right now. Staying in front of our customers, continuing to communicate, talk about customer challenges and customer opportunities as well. But certainly, it's not as effective when they're out making personal sales calls and having face-to-face meeting. So we'd like to see that be restored and happily would pay that cost, but that's one of those things that we simply have no idea when it will be safe to really be able to fully restore those programs. So measures like that will come back in due time. But certainly, we'd expect to have a much higher revenue base when those are restored as well. And we've historically seen our overhead costs kind of average between 20% to 25%. And coming back to being closer to 21% -- 21%, 21.5% of revenue here in the third quarter. Certainly, it's a function of cost control, some revenue recovery, but just continuing to be disciplined there and trying to keep those overhead costs as low as a percent of revenue as we can will always be our focus going forward. Yes. Certainly, I think the way we'll be looking at it is we'll look at kind of that normal sequential trend. And then just sort of compare and contrast there. I think that with revenue trends that we think can continue, certainly not at the strength of the recovery and the surge we saw in the third quarter. But with positive revenue trends continuing, that certainly gives us a helping hand, if you will.  The average -- we've got several outliers when you just look at a simple 10- or 5-year average over time. But it's usually about a 200-basis-point increase. And the fourth quarter can include things like we have an annual actuarial assessment, and we rebase a couple of the insurance-type liabilities, and that can go one way or the other on us. And so when you throw out some of those outliers, I think that 200 basis point kind of change will be sort of what we measure against. But as you know, we're always looking to try to do better. And if we can outperform a little bit on a revenue basis, then certainly that will win to help in hand. I think that in the third quarter some of the costs that we saw will go away temporarily in the second. A big cost element was -- were things like our group health and dental costs. Those kind of restored to normal, and frankly, we're a little bit higher when we look at our fringe benefit rate as a percent of revenue. The group health and dental costs were a little bit higher than what that normal rate has been. And as a result, that fringe rate was a little bit higher than normal. So I think that there's some catch-up on some cost items. So there's some puts and takes going both ways, and we'll just look to try to balance those. But we did want to say that -- I said it in the prepared comments, that I think that the biggest cost element that we have is the salaries, wages and benefits. And certainly, we're going to continue to keep our focus, one, on providing the very best service in our industry. And I'm really proud of what we achieved, continuing to deliver in the third quarter with historic low, matching our cargo claims ratio at 0.1% and continue to deliver 99%. But I think that we can keep that 200 basis point change kind of about 150 basis points, is the typical change in that salaries, wages and benefit. So if we can manage that kind of in line with normal seasonality, and I think we can. Then certainly, some of those other cost elements will be more a function of revenue trends, if you will, from the third to the fourth quarter. I think what we've said maybe a couple of years ago was 25% was kind of our long-term goal. And that would imply working towards a 75% operating ratio. When we achieve that goal, then we'd kind of update the internal number, if you will. And that doesn't mean that we certainly can't do better than that in a quarterly period. And I think we certainly can, and we've proven it in the past.  And when you think about our cost structure, with sort of 2/3 or around there of our costs being variable. If we can continue to manage those variable costs and produce leverage on those fixed costs, then we can produce some really strong numbers. But until we achieve the 75% annual operating ratio, and I think we'll keep that goal out there. And then we'll update it and start thinking about sort of what's next. But what we feel is a lot of confidence on the ability to continue to improve the operating ratio even further. We know we've got opportunity of just continuing to execute on a basic plan. And to achieve long-term operating ratio improvement, it's a focus on density and yield. And certainly, the density piece of that has been a challenge this year. But when you look at some of our operating metrics, despite the significant changes from first to second and then second to third, we've met those challenges, operated very efficiently and been able to control our costs. So we've done all the things there. But that yield piece is critically important as well. And just having a long-term consistent approach that is focused on outperforming our cost inflation that's led to -- and helped us improve the operating ratio over the long-term. So there's certainly -- we feel confident saying that we can continue to beat it. We'll have some quarters where we might be 35% or even up to 40%. We've done some of those numbers in the past. And certainly, the cost structure has improved when you think about our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So that creates an even stronger opportunity for us as we move forward. But we're not going to let that be a limiting factor either. We don't necessarily focus on incremental margins internally. What we're focused on is producing long-term profitable growth. And so to achieve the market share opportunities that we think are out there in front of us, it requires investments and doing things that create some cost. And so we're going to continue to make all the necessary investments we need to make and try to continue the string of the long-term profitable growth we've been able to deliver because that ultimately leads to increased shareholder value. That's definitely helping. So thank you very much, David. I think we've got a long-term approach, Ravi, that we look at our cost inflation every year. And then we sit across the table from our customers and talk about what our costs, how they're changing and then what we need in terms of rate. And certainly, the way we really manage the business is looking at customer profitability on an account-by-account basis. So there may be some customer accounts that we'll have to maybe be more aggressive with. And then there's other long-term customer accounts that may go into the equation that be a little bit lower than the average.  So it just kind of depends on each customer situation, and we'll look at those. But we've been pretty consistent the last few years with a general rate increase of around 5%. And then that kind of becomes the proxy for what we talk to customers on average. About for the need, and we've been successful in achieving our contractual increases throughout this year. But that kind of gets back to the heart of the true customer relationship that you have. And our industry is a relationship business. And so it's critical that we continue to talk with our customers and have that 2-way open and honest communication about things. And certainly, we're willing to do that, and it makes more sense when you can have a cost-based discussion versus the industry is tight and we need a double-digit increase this year. And the industry is loose this year, so we're going to give you some of that back next year and the rollercoaster ride that maybe some customers go on with when they make a decision other than select an Old Dominion. But we're really proud of kind of these long-term customer relationships that we have, and certainly, we think that will continue. And next year, just looking out, certainly, that's kind of the 4% to 5%. When you look at our long-term revenue per shipment, we've kind of averaged really between 4.5% and 5%, and that's been 75 to 100 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And we've already established a 3% wage increase that went into effect the 1st of September. So that's a big element of our cost inflation every year. And has been pretty consistent as well. So we already know some of those factors, and that'll kind of frame things up for us. But we'll look. And the yield numbers themselves, some of it will really depend. There's going to be some weird comparisons as we transition into next year with weight per shipment that might make your revenue per hundredweight look a little bit stronger than maybe that 5% type of number. So we'll just have to balance all of those. But underlying contract and general rate increase, I would expect that we'll see it kind of consistent with what our long-term trends have been. Well, we've been dealing with fuel that's been down 20% or more. And that's what it was down in this most recent quarter, and we produced a 74.5% operating ratio. So I think when we balance that fuel contribution with the overall yield, that's just a variable component of pricing. And it's something that we continue to look at. And as a contract turns over, we look at the fuel base. But I think that we've been pretty successful with our fuel strategy really over the last couple of years. It's been several years ago, where when fuel first really took a big drop that maybe the low end of our scale wasn't appropriate, and we waited a little time to go back to some of our customers and have to make some changes on that. So as long as fuel continues to stay consistent, it doesn't really go much lower, we'd like to see it come back a little bit because that certainly helps the top line number. But we're going to be -- if fuel continues to stay in this range where it is, around $2.40 a gallon, that's -- it's going to be down in the fourth quarter. That would be down in the first quarter and really be the second quarter of next year before it kind of comes back to par, that was when fuel started dropping in 2Q of this year. So we'll see. It'd be nice if it was a little bit higher because certainly that optically make our revenue numbers. When we come in every day and we look at what the revenue from the previous day was, and when we look at the revenue, we can say growth now. But looking at it with and without the fuel, without the fuel certainly looks much stronger, and it'd be nice if that was the overall number, but you play the hand that you're dealt, and that's what we'll continue to do. Certainly, when you look at inventory levels overall, they continue to be low and so I think that some of that will continue, but the consumer continues to consume. And I think that people are spending money in different ways. And you get down to it, that's still 70% to 80% of the overall economy. So as people continue to purchase things and there's got to be the production of those things and ultimate delivery and positioning for them to be able to buy them. So certainly, there's been some obvious changes in the retail landscape related to the pandemic and probably have seen e-commerce growth probably pulled forward a couple of years at least in terms of the change of e-commerce in terms of total retail sales. So that's been something that, as we talked about before, it creates some opportunity for the LTL industry. That's certainly not an overnight kind of phenomenon, and you don't build fulfillment centers overnight, but that's something that's certainly continuing to change, and we think we can benefit from. And we're going to do everything we can to make sure. But hinted at earlier, there's certainly some operational challenges that come along with managing more that freight and balancing, you're right, equipment pools and just the service demands can be different as well. So we've got to make sure that we keep all of that balanced as we flex and see more growth with our retail-related business.  But I think that certainly, we can see those trends continue and take advantage because the other big piece of that retail-related growth on the e-commerce side is the demand for superior service is even greater. As they're managing inventory levels, and inventory is tight, then certainly you can't afford to. And in many cases, when you deliver into many of the big-box retailers that have got programs in place that that will have penalties for vendors if their carriers aren't delivering on time and in full. Certainly, when you make the selection of choose an Old Dominion, we're going to deliver on time 99% of the time and our damages as a percent of revenue of 0.1%. So we certainly can meet that demand and service expectation for our customers and help them avoid charges down the line where the total cost of service is cheaper for them, even though they might pay a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion. Yes. I mean, that's the -- we were talking earlier about some of the labor costs and that salary, wages and benefits line. It's typically where that normal sequential deterioration in the operating ratio that's about 200 basis points. The majority of that comes from the salary, wages and benefits line. And most of those costs are going to be our productive labor cost. So we'll see how that balances as we transition. Typically, like I said, you'd see that inflate a little bit, and we're certainly going to do what we can and believe that we can keep those costs kind of in line with what that normal sequential trend will be. And some of it will just depend on kind of what the revenue base and how that trends through the fourth quarter compared to where we just were in the third. So -- but that will have more of an impact really on some of those more fixed types of costs. Yes. In terms of the long-term where overhead costs might go, we've just -- over the long run, we've seen those costs trend between that 20% to 25% type of range. And the reason for that is really what our market share opportunities are for the long-term. And we feel like we've got a really long runway for continued growth there, which will require continued investment in assets. And so as we continue to invest, certainly, that depreciation line will continue to stay more as a bigger component, if you will, versus getting to the point where there's not growth left, and you can create leverage on that. So we feel good about what the market share opportunities are and continuing to look at investing 10% to 15% of our revenues back into our CapEx programs every year that that will then drive the increase in depreciation. Some of those overhead costs, too, are more variable in nature. There are some elements that are bad debt expense. There's some performance-based compensation that's in there. There's other things that are more variable. So that 20% to 25%, maybe 5% to 8% of revenue is kind of more variable in nature that that's sort of within that overall element. So those will obviously continue to increase. But certainly, there's going to be opportunities out there. And we certainly are always looking to do what we can to minimize those costs. But what that means over the long run is that the improvement in the operating ratio has come out of our direct cost. And you referenced line haul a couple of times, and we put line haul, that's a direct operating expense. And there's a fixed nature of running our line haul operations. And when we add new service centers, sometimes that creates a little inefficiency on the line haul side, but it drives efficiency within our pickup/delivery operations because we're now putting our pickup/delivery workforce, if you will, closer to our customers and minimizing the time to our first stop. And so there's different trade-offs as we continue to grow and add to the overall footprint. But I think that certainly, there's opportunities for us to continue to be efficient there and drive further efficiencies. When you sort of break down our operations, we're at about 240 service centers now. When you look at the available capacity that we have in the network, that's the opportunity, whereas we increase density in one particular service center, that helps that service center's operating ratio. And when you're doing that across the spectrum of those 240, it's only the few that you're adding depreciation to every year where you're causing the operating ratio maybe to go the opposite direction. But you've got a bigger pool that they're working on some type of improvement program. And that's really at the heart of why we've got confidence in saying we can continue to drive the operating ratio even lower than where it is today. Yes. I thought with that long-winded response, you might forget about that one, but with September, let's see, so the overall -- do you want the year-over-year for September? Okay. So for weight, year-over-year tonnage was up 3.6%. And then sequentially, September's tonnage was up 4.3% over August. On the shipment side, the shipments per day were down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis. So compared to September of last year, shipments in September on a sequential basis were up 4.6% versus August. Yes. The overall capacity of the service in a network is probably between 25% and 30% now. We've gotten above that 30% threshold when things really weakened. And I think we're kind of back in that type of range now, which is good for us, especially as we transition to next year. But as Greg mentioned earlier, we've got several facilities that we think will be opening just between now and the end of the first quarter. So I think that we'll see some openings in '21, but there will also be some facilities that we either just expand or we move into a larger facility and out of another one. Much of the investment will be continuing to add out in some of our larger metro areas where we may add a second, third, fourth or fifth facility. I think that there's tremendous market share opportunity there. We've seen that play out in the Midwest, in particular, which is the largest LTL market. And so I think that certainly, we've got opportunities there. And then we'll continue to look at where we have density for end of the line type of locations and can add a facility in a market that -- just like I was talking about earlier, that can help us in reducing some of our pickup/delivery cost as well just by getting out closer to our customers. But we generally want to make sure that there's enough freight opportunity and density there to support an operation in the market. On the other side and the other pieces, certainly, we've got equipment capacity right now. I think that we haven't finalized our CapEx. We'll give that on next quarter's call. But we had a bit of a holiday this year because of the overinvestment in equipment in '18 and '19. This year, we only spent $20 million on equipment. So I think that we'll see that number kind of get back to more of a normalized type of range, and we expect to see the overall CapEx kind of back in that 10% to 15% range, but probably towards the upper end of that.  But we've still got some things to finalize as we kind of transition through the fourth quarter and really get to the point of putting orders in place. But with all that said, I think that typically, we can create, and especially if we get into a really strong revenue growth environment, we can create leverage there and be able to offset those costs. And that kind of just goes back into maybe the incremental margin conversation we were having earlier. We certainly, I think, can produce some strong incrementals, but a lot of it will be dependent on the good expectations for next year. And we're still having conversations with customers as we're building up our forecast for next year and from a bottoms-up and a top-down basis. And there's still some uncertainty, obviously, hanging out there that we'll see it may change some people's minds next week based on the results of the election. Well, I think we've talked about being able to operate in this type of range on an annualized basis for some time and certainly made a lot of progress this year. Used to kind of say we needed revenue growth to be able to improve the operating ratio, but this environment was so unusual. We had to take immediate and aggressive action to address some of the cost because of how immediate the drop-off in revenue was and just the unavailability of work that was out there back in April. And so it's been good as we transitioned through and saw some of the recovery began back in May when things sort of stabilized and started improving. And we brought back probably about 1,400 employees compared back to April. And so we continue to onboard people to keep up with these demand trends. And -- but have really done a good job in balancing all of our costs. And I think what we've seen in the past in trying to take that forward, as we move into the future, is a lot of times, when you go through a period like this, you do a lot of evaluation of your processes, your people and systems and so forth. And some of the productivity that we saw improvements that we made back in the '08 and '09 timeframe, those carried forward for years to come. And so we certainly expect that some of this improvement in productivity as we transition back into a growth environment and start bringing newer people onboard, we obviously want to maintain these measurements of productivity. And I think that we'll be able to. And so certainly, that's encouraging. That's the biggest piece of the cost structure and the most critical element for us to continue to manage those and other true controllable costs as we transition back into more of a normalized growth environment in terms of what our expectations have been and what we've been able to produce in the past. So we certainly -- again, we've talked about it before, but we believe we can continue to improve the operating ratio. And it's just based on how that model works. If we can continue to improve the network density that generally creates productivity opportunities. And if we continue to be disciplined and have a cost-based type of approach to managing our yields, both of those generally require the positive macro environment to support those initiatives. We've done it when the macro environment wasn't good. But certainly, we think as we transition to more of a positive one, they'll continue to help on those fronts, and we can produce further operating ratio improvement. Yes, operating cash flow. Well, you've always got some changes in things that maybe are deferred that get paid. But when I think when you look on an overall basis, from a year-to-date standpoint, we produced really solid cash flow from operations. And so I've been pleased with that. But from a quarterly standpoint, could just be the timing effect of some of the deferred taxes that are somewhat related to the CARES Act from -- that was passed earlier this year that helped from some of the payroll taxes and whatnot.  And just some other changes in the timing effect of things. But really strong, I think, cash flow performance, if you will, in terms of kind of where we are. It's probably a little below on a year-to-date basis last year, but overall, it's approaching $700 million of cash from ops this year. So really strong, and we'll continue -- we've got it kind of in-hand to be able to put to work as we think about our CapEx. And as you know, our first priority for capital allocation is investing in our sales, and that the CapEx plan was a little bit lower this year. But a big piece of that was the equipment, as we talked about earlier. So we'll be evaluating that, as we transition next year, but it certainly will probably be a much larger number for CapEx than what we had this year. No, it's weight per shipment driven, Scott. Like we mentioned before, the shipments are trending in line in October, and as you know, typically, our business kind of builds up and September is usually the strongest month of the year for us. And so, we saw that again, and those shipments continue to be really strong there. In fact, we're back to about kind of where when we put our forecast together for the beginning of the year back to where we thought we'd be in September but took an unusual route to get there. And you compare September shipment level to March, which is really before things begin to really be affected by the pandemic. We're kind of in line with the normal trend there of kind of you look back over time, where September would be versus March. So we're seeing good trends there. But the October, the shipments per day right in line right now at this point with what the longer-term -- the 10-year average sequential trend would be and -- but just a little bit softer on the weight per shipment side, which is not totally unexpected. We believe that, that would continue to sort of come back as our smaller customers continue to sort of get back to their normalized level. The mix is still slanted a little bit heavier to our larger national accounts than kind of historical trends by a couple of points probably. But nevertheless, those smaller accounts are continuing to perform well and coming back. So that's certainly beneficial. But yield trends continue to be solid, and it's really just a function of that weight per shipment is dropping a little bit on us. But some of that, like we mentioned, was us taking control and getting some of the transactional freight out of our business right now. Well, again, I think that when you just look and think about from a customer standpoint and how they're getting freight out, September is going to be the build-up. And when you look over the past 20 years, a normal sequential trend is down about 3%. There's really been only one October in the past 20 years that's been positive versus September. So obviously, we've got a week left in the month, and we're just talking about numbers that aren't finalized, but this is about where, frankly, we thought we would be, and we're managing to. So it's not been a surprise, especially with the fact that, again, we have limited some shipments out of the system. So it would have been slightly better, but very normal and expected to see, even as things were building up that we'd see a little bit of a drop-off in October versus the September trend there. And that's just really a function when you look across the spectrum of all of our customer accounts, the way they're managing their business and their shipment trends and so forth. So not unexpected to see it at all. Well, I mean, we're not ready to call next year's operating ratio. But I think that certainly, if revenue plays out like we hope it will, transitioning then that obviously creates an opportunity. We generally, on average, have been produced or improving the operating ratio, 80 to 100 basis points kind of on average each year. And just taking kind of where we are from a year-to-date basis, then obviously we're a little bit better than that at this point than that longer-term trend despite the fact that revenues have been affected like they hadn't been. So we'll see where we end up next year, but we're not ready to give any specific color on it. But certainly, in an improving revenue environment, it makes the ability to improve operating ratio easier than certainly what we've seen and had to deal with this year."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial and operating results for the second quarter despite the operating challenges we faced with the economy. Although, our revenue declined 15.5%, we were pleased to improve our operating ratio to a quarterly record of 77.8%. We accomplished this by focusing on improving our yield, managing our variable cost, and controlling our discretionary spending. Our yield management process has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long term. Through this process, we manage profitability on an account-by-account basis. We believe this approach is consistent and fair for our customers. Is also supportive of our ongoing investments in capacity and technology while helping offset cost inflation. We believe customers appreciate the consistency of this approach, as they know what to expect from us each year. Providing superior service at a fair price is our value proposition, which is critical to our long-term customer relationships. Our team is relentless in its commitment to providing the very best levels of service to our customers regardless of the economic environment. While we contended with many operating challenges in the second quarter, including the 16.6% decrease in shipments per day, we produced a new company quarterly claims ratio of 0.1% while also improving productivity. There are many components of our industry leading service. And based on customer feedback, we believe the gap between us and our competition has widened in the current environment. It is historically become a common practice in our industry to focus primarily on cost in a recessionary environment. This narrow focus generally leads customer service failures, which is why we are so committed to the service standards that support our revenue quality. We have long believed that this creates a competitive advantage for us in our industry and it's especially critical now because the importance of high quality and dependable service seems to have recently increased for many of our customers. As evidenced to this trend, we have been awarded new business in the past few months from customers that has historically provided lower rates rather than overall value. This trend not only leads us to believe that many of our competitors are remaining relatively disciplined with their pricing, but it is also encouraging for future market share opportunities. While the quality of our revenue is critical to our operating ratio, appropriately managing our cost is just as import. Minimizing our cost inflation on a per shipment basis is an ongoing process based largely on the productivity of our employees as salaries, wages and benefits represent our largest expense. As a result of operating efficiencies and improved productivity, we are able to improve our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter. The enforcement reality of the sudden significant reduction in revenue that occurred in April 2020 was an adjustment to our workforce to balance our employee count with available work, believing that the economy could recover quickly, we implemented an employee furlough program that initially resulted in a 15.5% year-over-year decrease in our full-time employees in April. While the economy is still recovering, our volumes increased sequentially in May and June, and we are cautiously optimistic that this accelerating trend can continue. Many of our furloughed employees have been able to return to work as a result of this improvement. We took various other measures to reduce operating expenses, while also controlling discretionary spending to reduced overhead costs. In addition, circumstances associated with the COVID-19 environment created certain cost savings that are expected to diminish in future periods, such as a reduction in group health and dental claims travel and customer entertainment. Second quarter of 2020 was one of the most difficult periods I have experienced in my career. And I am especially proud of our team's ability to respond quickly and manage our operations in this environment. I think the quality of our results shows that our business model works in both good times and bad. While certain challenges will likely continue until the economy recovers, we believe there will be long-term changes to supply chains that should create opportunities for the LTL industry. With our industry-leading service, our unmatched long-term investments in service center capacity and the dedication of our OD family of employees, I'm confident that we are in a better position than any other carrier in the industry to respond to increased customer needs for LTL services. As a result, I am also confident in our ability to continue our long term, are producing profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $896.2 million, which was a 15.5% decrease from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which contributed to our earnings per diluted share of $1.25 for the quarter. Our revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 12.1% decrease in LTL tons and a 3.8% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Decrease in the average price of diesel fuel reduced our fuel surcharges, which had an impact on our topline revenue as well as our yield, excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.5% due primarily to the significant increase in weight per shipment. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being the average length of haul and weight per shipment. Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in our mix. As a result, revenue per hundredweight is a tough measure to evaluate, when the mix of our business changes so significantly like it did during the second quarter. While the change in revenue per hundredweight might suggest otherwise, we continue to negotiate rate increases during the second quarter and believe underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent. We believe revenue per shipment is a better measurement, as we focus internally on maintaining a positive spread between our revenue and cost per shipment. The 4.9% increase in revenue per shipment excluding fuel surcharges, for the second quarter, was relatively consistent with the change in the first quarter of 2020, as well as our long-term trends. With respect to our revenue trend during the second quarter, revenue per day on a year-over-year basis was down 19.3% in April, but then sequentially improved in the remaining months of the quarter. Average revenue per day in June, for example, was down 11.4% as compared to June 2019. Our change in volumes also followed a similar pattern. On a sequential basis, LTL shipments per day decreased 15.7% in April as compared to March 2020. Shipments per day then increased 9.7% from April to May and increased 7.1% from May to June. The sequential acceleration and shipments in revenue has continued into July. With only a couple of days remaining in the month, our current revenue per day is trending down approximately 3% plus or minus. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which was a record for us despite the significant decline in revenue. More than two-thirds of our costs are variable or semi-variable and our team was effective in matching these costs with the change in revenue, while also controlling our discretionary spending. Our operations team also did an outstanding job with improving efficiencies during the quarter. We have historically improved productivity during recessionary environments and from experience, we believe we can maintain, much of this productivity once we return to a growth environment. While the loss of revenue certainly had a deleveraging effect on our fixed cost, the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $312.2 million and $516.2 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $67.9 million and $120.1 million for the same periods. We returned $146.1 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter and $342.7 million for the first half of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total included $306.8 million of share repurchases and $35.9 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter 2020 was 25.7% as compared to 26.1% in the second quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So, Adam, if I could maybe start going back to your commentary on the pricing environment for a moment, because I think in your prepared comments you said that the pricing environment remains relatively consistent with what you've been seeing over the past several quarters with regard to the second quarter. We have heard some anecdotes on public conference calls here over the last couple of days that maybe there's been a little bit of an acceleration in pricing, in the third quarter and I'm just curious if you could maybe talk about - have you noticed a shift in tone around pricing in discussions with your customers over the past several weeks, maybe couple of months?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know that we've heard a shift in tone at any point recently. Certainly, our approach is always one to consistency and I think that's what our customers appreciate. They know what to expect out of us and we're pretty disciplined in that respect to focus on what our cost inflation is every year and the pricing, the operating ratio on an account-by-account basis that, that we try to target with our customer accounts as well. So, for us, we just continue on with our consistent approach and we've been getting increases all year long. I mean, in some cases, in the early part of this quarter, that may have impacted some of our volumes as well. But like we mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some volumes coming back to us, that's been an encouraging trend, and some of the business that we may have lost back in April. Some of that business coming back to us just based on the service that they received from the other carrier that they might have switched to. And when they look and think about the total value equation, they didn't feel like they were getting the value there and they came back to us. So that's what we'll continue to focus on is just our consistent long-term type of approach to offset cost inflation that's workforce and that's what we intend to continue.\nJack Atkins: And then I guess from my follow-up question, just kind of thinking about the operating ratio, here. I guess normal seasonality 2Q to 3Q, would call for some modest deterioration, but your commentary around revenue trends per day in July would indicate that maybe revenue is trending better sequentially, but there may be - there are some temporary costs that are getting layered back in, now the business is stabilizing. So Adam, can you maybe help us kind of take me to those puts and takes and how that relates to or progression as we move into the third quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, it's typically is about a 50 basis point deterioration from the second to the third, but in a normal environment, which clearly we are in, and we would have seen the second quarter revenue of about 10% over the first quarter and then third quarter increase is slightly typically from the second quarter. So you get, historically speaking, most of your operating ratio improvement there in the second quarter on a sequential basis, that is. And so, in this environment, if we can keep this accelerating revenue trend, then some of the leverage that we lost particularly in overhead and within that overhead category on the depreciation, we lost quite a few basis points there from the first and the second quarter. So, if we can continue this revenue trend and revenue can meet or exceed than where we were in the first quarter, then certainly that depreciation in particular unwinds, and there should be some other costs that we unwind along with that. And we fully expect to try to maintain the productivity that should continue, certainly there will be some costs that will be coming back online in the third quarter. But given all of those factors, we certainly think that we should definitely be able to beat what that long term deterioration is simply, if nothing else, just the improvement that we should have the leverage on the depreciation.\nOperator: We'll now take our next question from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: Greg in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the quality of revenue and kind of improving that here in this quarter, I would think that, that could maybe a little bit more challenging in a negative tonnage environment and maybe in a stronger tonnage environment where you can pick and choose the freight that you want. It's a little bit easier. So can you expand on that comment? And essentially what you're focused on and what you're able to do from a quality of revenue standpoint, right now?\nGreg Gantt: Sure, Todd. No doubt in this deteriorating environment that we just came through. We did see customers more likely to put out bids and rebid the freight and that kind of thing. And that was definitely a challenge for us. And Adam mentioned, some of that - some of our - we did lose some business in that process, but we gained some from others and fortunately, in other cases, we are gaining back some revenue that we lost earlier, because of they couldn't meet the service standards that they had with us. So it's ever a challenge, that's our business. And there is always you win some you lose some. But fortunately, at the end of the day, you hope that your service outshines, the value outshines your competitors. So far so good. We are regaining some of the business that we lost. That's a good thing. We've taken on some new additional business of late. So I think there have been some opportunities that did open up for us as the quarter went all and as we roll into the third quarter, so far in the month of July, it's definitely looking strong.\nTodd Fowler: So, Greg you said in a comment that - yeah - so some of the business that you lost earlier in the quarter, maybe was more some price sensitive business and it didn't fit as well in the network or what is this profitable, and so it's okay to see that go away, but you're starting to see some of that come back now?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Coming back at our price. Right.\nTodd Fowler: Got you, okay, that makes sense.\nGreg Gantt: Coming back at our price. We obviously lost it to a lower price, but that doesn't mean the customer got a greater value and it came back because of the value we provide.\nTodd Fowler: Understood. Okay. And then just for my follow-up; Adam, do you have any color or anything you can share on the increase in the weight per shipment, the up 5% and kind of the level that you're at right now, is that something that you think is sustainable? Do you see that as a shift in the business that you're handling or is that indication of improvement in underlying economic activity? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: The weight per shipment is certainly been a wild swing since the trend that we had back in January and February, right when things started changing our weight per shipment increased above 1,600 pounds in March, it reached a peak of 1,677 pounds in April and then it started working its way back to sort of a - more of an average that we've seen over the longer term of about 1,600 pounds. It was right at 1,600 pounds in June. And most of that was in the early stages of some of the stay at home orders. We had more national account business that remained open. Our national account business typically has a higher weight per shipment than our smaller mom-and-pop type of accounts. And so, now some of those smaller accounts are starting to come back online. But we're still getting, I would say more business from our national accounts. They continue to be strong. And when you think about some of the companies that are performing well in this environment and that have increased demand, it's a lot of those bigger on the retail side, some of those bigger retailers and their weight per shipment just continues to be much heavier. So it's a little bit different mix. But we're happy to see it kind of coming back to the 1,600 pound range. And we expect that is more of the smaller accounts come back online. It could drift down a little bit lower, but that 1,600 pound range is continued into the July at this point. And so, if we can see that stay around that sort of level for the time being, that'd be a good trends and contributor too to the overall revenue per shipment that we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Maybe, Adam, I could hit back on pricing a little bit. Can you give us maybe a little bit more specific sort commentary on where contracts are kind of being reset, as you get through the quarter? I don't know how much activity was actually happening in 2Q, but could you give us just sort of a rough sense. It sounds like it's been consistent with what you've seen, but kind of curious if there is incremental color you can add?\nAdam Satterfield: We kind of stopped talking about the - our average contract renewals. And some of that, we hear others kind of give the same commentary and be it average increases in contracts or general increases, never seen the fully reconcile even factoring in changes in weight per shipment to what some of the others might report as their revenue per hundredweight. And so I would just say that, that looking at revenue per shipment and how that's trended, that's more in line with what we've been able to achieve with increase is kind of on average. And typically that's been between 4% to 5% and that's somewhat falls in alignment as well. We have a general rate increase that went into effect earlier this year, that was at 4.9%. And that's generally the target that we have for our contracts as well. So, in that ballpark is really what our long-term trend has been. It's what we continue to target. And it's what we've been able to achieve this year. So that it's been a good thing. Obviously, the long-term success of that program, managing our cost where there is a positive delta between our revenue per shipment and our cost per shipment managing those two factors has really been a key contributor to our long-term operating ratio improvement.\nChris Wetherbee: And then maybe when you think about volume opportunities and just sort of how you want to manage your network in the context of a potentially sort of tightening truckload cycle, when we've seen these in the past, there has been spillover into the LTL market. You guys have always been disciplined about what kind of business you want to take on in those kinds of tight market who maybe not all of it is what you really do want in the network. But I don't know if it's too early to see any indications of that or maybe talk a bit about how you're thinking about handling that as you move forward. But just kind of curious what your expectations are potentially around that truckload opportunity as things kind of move in. So maybe be it would be kind of larger LTL, smaller TL type of opportunities going forward.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I mean certainly that creates some opportunities for us. And it really just gets back to our sales team, their discussions and ongoing conversations with our customers what their customer needs are. And if they've got freight that needs to be moved and we can help out, obviously volumes are off for us. Even though they're getting better, there is still down on a year-over-year basis. So we've got capacity and we're ready to help our customers whenever we can. If that's a heavier weighted shipment that might have moved by truckload, there is no such thing as bad freight, there is poorly priced freight. So if we understand all the shipment characteristics and have got good pricing practices in place, which I believe we do, then certainly we're willing to handle about any shipment that a customer would want us to. The best thing that we would see that the changing trends in the truckload world would be that if the truckload rates continue to increase. Typically, that has the effect of increasing many of our competitors cost structure. Many of our competitors use outsourced truckload for purchase transportation. So if our competitors now have got some unexpected cost inflation, that's going to put more rate pressure for themselves to go back and increase their rates typically that has the effect too of moving normal LTL business our way. So multiple opportunities I think both from a direct and indirect basis for the truckload world improving.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: I was just wondering, Adam, could you give us a sense of how much the lower group health and dental expenses were in Q2? I know that you said some of that may come back in Q3 and in Q4. So just wondering if there's any color you could provided there to help us with modeling.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I mean certainly that was a benefit. Our overall fringe rate though in the second quarter was 33.6%. And we typically target about 34%. I think that at the beginning of the year, that was something that we talked about. And so just the change and we were at 34% in the second quarter of last year. So those numbers are pretty comparable from period-to-period, but probably resulted, I would just say fringes overall and $2 million, $1 million to $2 million of savings comparing what we had this quarter versus what the fringe rate was in 2Q of '19. So a little savings there. There is always sort of puts and takes in that fringe type of number, certainly we were fortunate, I guess, if you will, to see that group health and dental was down and some of the others were up. And on a sequential basis, simply having more income in the second quarter than the first that drives things like our 401(K) match that we give to our employees and it's things like that continuously improving our benefits overall and giving more paid time off and doing some of these things that continue to motivate our employees, and we think helps drive the bottom line success as well. They understand the success. They drive for the company. They get rewarded for it. So we think that's been a very motivational tool over the years for our employees and helping our culture.\nAllison Landry: And then, I'm sorry if I missed this earlier in the remarks, but could you give us the productivity metrics in the quarter? I think you said, sort of, they improved across-the-board, but some of the specific KPIs. And then, if you could give us a sense of where you are with furlough and just your overall view on how to think about headcount levels in the second half? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes, we didn't give the specifics on the productivity, but saw really strong performance, our platform shipments per hour for the quarter improved 7.1%, our P&D shipments per hour improved 4.2%, even our line haul light mode average had improved 0.8%. And we talked about before that, that not all cost are variable, and running this line-haul network that we have serving 238 service centers, there is a fixed element of running that cost, but I was really pleased with all the level of productivity that we had and as such. When you look at our productive labor cost on a per shipment basis. So again getting things back to how they are per shipment, overall they were right at about 3% cost inflation. And that's pretty much in line with the wage increase that we gave last year. So we had improvement. We don't give this level of detail, but our P&D and our Dock costs per shipment were essentially both flat and then we had a little inflation overall in line-haul. But that would be expected based on that trend. I'd say, an update on the headcount. Overall, in June, we were down - the full time employees were down 10.5% just comparing June of this year to June of last year. So we brought many people back from the furlough program. If you look and compare April to June. The headcount is up about 4.5 overall, but if you compare kind of where we are today to where we were in March, we're down about 1,400 positions overall, which is about 7%. And based on where we are, our shipments per day should be higher in July than they were back in March. So that was kind of what we've talked about in the prepared remarks that unfortunately when we go through an environment like this, we've made adjustments like, we have, but you find areas of productivity when each department leader is going through evaluating their costing and costs don't save them sales. It takes action and a plan. We've gone through and we've figured out ways to be able to do more with less. And I think that's what we're seeing now. But if our accelerating trends continue, we certainly will have to continue to bring back some more employees, we fully expect and we'd like to that, because they go hand in hand with the increase in volumes. But I think overall when you look at sort of the level of headcount with the volumes, those should come back in alignment and eventually show some improvement there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to talk a little bit about the residential delivery, as one of your competitors basically said they saw an uptick, almost a doubling in the percentage. It's still ticked down a little bit for them, but definitely above the prior year. Can you talk a little bit about your experience with the residential market and how you see the margins there for OD?\nAdam Satterfield: Jason, we do not measure the number of residential deliveries that we had. And I did anecdotally hear a whole lot of commentary about additional residentials. I know we had a few more in one segment of our business, but I don't think we saw a significant uptick in residentials at all.\nJason Seidl: And would you say that the margins on your residential deliveries are equal to or better than the regular margins?\nGreg Gantt: We, Jason, as all of our accounts, we price on based on the cost of those accounts require, and we price them accordingly. We price in the residential stop, there is a fee for that, as you know. We price them accordingly based on the cost. So I think that's an account-by-account basis, but they are not necessarily better or worse than the other businesses.\nJason Seidl: And my follow up is going to be on any potential acquisitions and the outlook. I know in the past you mentioned your desire to potentially add some, I guess, business lines that would be complementary to your LTL operations. We've also been here in the marketplace that the appetite for acquisitions as picked back up a little bit from sort of the start of COVID. Wondering what your thoughts on that going forward.\nGreg Gantt: At this point in time, Jason, we - maybe we have somewhat of an appetite for an acquisition. I just - I don't know who that is or exactly what that is. At this point, we're not looking at anything currently. And we always have opportunities across the desk and we evaluate those as they come along, but currently, at this time, we're not looking at anything in particular.\nOperator: We'll now take a question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So Adam just on the 3% drop in rev per day in July. I missed it, if you said so, but directionally, can you talk about sort of the tonnage, weight and yield trends within just directionally?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. A lot of that is mainly on the tonnage. And so you've got some of the yield, if you will, sequentially that, that's moving up a little bit, but yeah, we're continuing to see acceleration essentially on the shipments and the time and our yields continue to perform as well. But overall, it's good to see. Obviously that coming back closer to kind where we were last year after going through the second quarter and revenue being down double-digits and certainly it feels a lot easier to manage and should produce a lot more opportunities, once we can get back to the revenue being flat and eventually get back to a growth environment, which is what we're more used to.\nScott Group: And then I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. So you're seeing the biggest revenue drop in a decade. And you put up record margins and by the way, it's not just you, we've seen this from some of the other trucking companies this quarter. And I'm just trying to understand how this is happening? You mentioned a little bit of that healthcare cost, but do you think there is anything else unusual from a cost standpoint, either fuel or lack of congestion or something else? I guess and ultimately what I'm trying to figure out is next year we're going to have good volume and revenue growth, hopefully. So should we be thinking about strong incremental margins next year and getting to a mid '70s operating ratio? Or is next year, a year, we get the revenue, but maybe we don't get the incremental margin, because there were something that was just unusual helping in this environment? I guess that's the question.\nGreg Gantt: Scott, let me say this. There were certainly some things that worked in our favor, not just ours, but probably the entire industry. Obviously the traffic congestion was a lot less than it has been in the past. We did save some money on the group health, and had less spend on customer entertainment, some marketing - areas in marketing were down from what we normally see. So there were some things that did say some short-term tight cost. But I'll say this, when this thing first started, we sat down as a management team and we made a plan. And the one thing that I made very clear was we had to execute on that plan. We didn't dillydally, we executed and I think everybody took it very serious what they had to do. Our big concern was continue to give the type of service that our customers are used to. We didn't cut anything from that standpoint, we're very pointed and determined in our efforts to continue those all of different service measures that we have and to continue to improve on those. We did it. And I think you saw it in a reduced claims and our own time percentage was still above 99%. So we did not slack off in any way, shape or form from that standpoint. And I think our customers accepted it, while we may have saw some business walk for price early in the quarter. It started to come back later in the quarter as they realize they weren't getting what they were used to with OD. So, yes, there were some areas where we did save some money. But we did a lot of the things that we had to do to help our sales from a productivity standpoint. So, yes and good. Certainly, we made a lot of things happen that we're very proud of at this point in time. As far as next year, certainly, we think that there is an opportunity to continue to have the same type of productivity levels of improvement that we had in the second quarter. You can, measure it from there. We certainly expect our revenue growth to come back. Not exactly sure where that's going at this point in time. Who knows where the economy is going to go, we're facing a lot of things later this year and on in the next year with the election year and all that, but a lot of challenges ahead, but we do definitely think, if we have some growth that we can drive however lower. I don't think there's any doubt about it as we've said before, we think we can manage through the good times and the bad. I think we've proven that in the past, but I don't think there's any doubt. We will continue to prove that into the future.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Just a follow-up on that a little bit specifically as it relates to fuel. It seemed to be a tailwind for a lot of carriers in the quarter, what was the impact, Adam, of the sharp drop that we saw from March to April in fuel, was it a good guy in the quarter, significant --?\nAdam Satterfield: Dave, we've tried to structure our fuel tables to really where they don't really impact us on the bottom line, too much one way or the other. We got hurt a little bit a few years ago back in '16 and really didn't have the lower end of our table where it needed to be, but we address that throughout the year and then fully address that when the next GRI came about. So net-net, we try to do some back of the envelope type of calculations and believe it was fairly minimal, on a net basis. Maybe overall slightly good. But the hard thing to try to negotiate and do these back of the envelope type of calculations is the simple fact that fuel is just another element that's pricing, that's negotiated with our customers. So, if you've got somebody that, that wants to make in this environment look like their base rates were that, that they didn't take an increase, but we got an overall improvement in our fuel contribution or some other type of element that really gives us the same level of revenue then that just becomes a tool to negotiate with. So it's really hard to try to make that comparison. But I'll say that the change on the call side, I mean obviously it hit us hard on the topline. And then on the cost side, you see the change and the improvement in the operating supplies and expenses, a big driver of that not all of it, but a big driver of that was the decrease in fuel typically when fuel changes so significantly like that in a period, you'd see the corresponding increase in your labor cost. And I think that hit kind of mask the overall improvement, if you will, to keep our labor cost essentially flat like we did in this environment with the surcharge revenue being down so much. It was really impressive to me and I thought that was the biggest driver in our ability to improve the operating ratio was what we were able to accomplish with all of those labor cost as a percent of revenue.\nDavid Ross: And then, another thing impressive has been the insurance and claims line item, it's been remarkably low and steady in a tough insurance market for a long time. Can you talk a little bit more either Adam or Greg about what really makes it a non-issue for you guys and not something that investors have had to worry about on the expense you probably just had.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, there is two elements that go into that insurance and claims line, that's our auto accidents. We call it BIPD. The bodily injury and property damage in the cargo claims. And fortunately for us, our cargo claims has consistently improved and almost non-existent at a record 0.1% for this most recent quarter. So that element has come a long way. You go back to the recession, when I felt like we really differentiated ourselves the great recession of '09, when we really differentiated ourselves from our competition. We are above 1% and we believe that, that's where the industry average is likely still north of 1% from the data that we get and feedback from customers. So that's a good thing that we've consistently driven that claims ratio down. On the auto side, certainly this year and it's in the second quarter, like most of the other carriers, we're facing significant inflation with our insurance rates, but we've been very fortunate with the fact that all the investment in new equipment and safety systems and training and so forth that we've made over the years, those all have accident mitigation type of tools with them. And our tractors now and then just continuous training on the Dock and other places and that we've done. And so there is an element that goes into this line, there is an element in our salaries, wages and benefits that goes hand in hand with those safety programs. And we continue to see workers' comp which is in the benefit line to improvement there. And so I think it's just, it's been a focus of our company that have safety programs in place and always be trying to continuously improve those and I think we've seen a big benefit, the insurance line is one, but, there is a hidden one that's in the fringe benefit line on the workers' comp that goes hand-in-hand. So if we can just keep our accident frequency ratios low those continuously improve and try to keep severity low as well and some of that's mitigated by the investment in technology on the tractors. And hopefully we can keep that line item consistent like it has been in that 1% to 1.2% type of range.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa: So, Greg, you mentioned in your opening remarks, some lasting changes to supply chains as a result of the pandemic, which you think could benefit LTL carriers. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit and get into some details. And then maybe in the process touch on what kind of e-commerce volumes you're seeing and if you've seen a big uptick in demand on that front and how it might impact your business?\nGreg Gantt: We did see increases on those e-commerce type accounts. We did see some big revenue jumps with those particular accounts on the inbound side for us particularly. I think you know we don't participate in a lot of home deliveries and that kind of thing, but there is another end of that. So we did see some upticks on those accounts, which is a good thing. And that was really what those comments we're pointed towards. I think we'll continue to see those type of customers business basis grow. So I think that's a good thing for us generally speaking.\nAri Rosa: And does - do the characteristics of that business from either pricing or kind of weight standpoint vary in terms of how it impacts your costs. I mean, I imagine you're still going to be pricing appropriately as you've kind of hammered home for years. But how does that business vary in terms of its characteristics?\nGreg Gantt: Those accounts, Ariel, they have practically everything, they have a very, very wide variety of products. So, yes, each account that goes into those is vastly different, but they are all priced accordingly. So I don't think there is anything different generally speaking than with a lot of our other accounts, but we will price them accordingly. Regardless of the product.\nAri Rosa: Got it, thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Yes - I was just going to add that we've seen growth over the last couple of years in our retail-related business. It's close to 30% of our overall revenues that were still closely align with the industrial sector. But, nevertheless, that business has been growing. So this has been a trend that's been evolving but certainly accelerating in this environment and things are going to completely change overnight. In terms of supply chains and whatnot, but certainly we feel like that more fulfillment centers, things of that nature, as they continue to be built around both the landscape and much of the freight that will be inbound those fulfillment centers will be more conducive to the LTL type quantity shipments. And so we certainly believe that we've already been winning business in that area and can continue because to be able to maintain the manage inventory quantities and the number of SKUs that they want to have in those facilities. You've got to have tight inventory controls and that requires confidence in your carrier to deliver on time and without damage and certainly, I think we've proven that we do that better than anyone and I think that we'll be able to continue to participate and that element of the business continuing to give us a little market share.\nAri Rosa: And then I just wanted to touch for my last question on, the operating ratio and I know this is obviously, you guys have addressed this a bit, but really impressive. On the cost front, is it appropriate for us to be thinking about a sub 80 operating ratio is kind of the new plateau and would it be a surprise to see that tick back up if congestion returns the highways and that sort of thing and then in the past you've occasionally provided a view on where you expect incremental margins to be I think you've kind of talked about something in the 25% range, should we be looking for kind of a step-up based on, based on this quarter, and just the impressive performance you're able to deliver.\nGreg Gantt: I mean certainly there will be some costs that will come back into the business and we'll be prepared for those, but there should be other cost savings opportunities. Keep in mind with the big drop in revenue that we saw typically when you look long term it's the density, the revenue per service factors is that has increased the operating ratio has improved and when we look at individual service centers and regions around the country. We know that we've got ongoing opportunity to improve our operating ratio and it really is driven down to the service center level. When you look and think about all the dollars that we've invested over the years and expanding our door capacity and then the individual opportunity to improve the service centers ratio, all those 238 service centers roll up into the company average. And you might have some that we've just expanded and maybe curve, the operating ratio, but you've got a much larger group that we're leveraging all the fixed cost there because we own most of our facilities, and so it gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this operating ratio lower once the density factors come back, but it's the density and the yield and both of those generally require a positive economic backdrop to support each. Those are the two key really to drive long-term operating ratio improvement and we're going to continue to focus on those. It's a matter of managing revenue quality and cost and we've got to consistently do both. We've got to continue to look for ways that we can keep our cost inflation low while continuing to also give the service to our customers that provides value and allows us to get the consistent rate increases that we need as well and so this just continues to build on itself and also allows us to do. The most important thing and that's taken care of our employees and keep them motivated keep on them engaged to continue to give service to be productive that employee and our family culture that we have is really what's been driving our long-term success. When we want to make sure that we don't miss out on that element as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: All the good questions have been answered. Asked to answer. So, I guess, I'll have to ask a couple of bad one. So forgive me. I'm just want to think about the sequential, I mean, I know OR is kind of an output of various moving parts. And as I think about the sequential movement from 2Q to 3Q, I just wonder why the output won't actually be more challenge, especially given what's happening in the weight per shipment side, because correct me if I'm wrong, Adam, you mentioned that weight per shipment kind of was volatile, but then maybe went down towards the end of the quarter. So as shipments are going up, weight per shipment coming down, you're adding resources just to serve the shipments, wouldn't that represent, I mean, it's maybe overly simplistic, but doesn't represent maybe an incremental headwind on the OR as we think about kind of moving parts. If you can talk about that?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I mean, certainly there are a lot of moving parts right now as we work our way through this environment. And so, yes, sequentially, the weight per shipment is coming down, but all up on a year-over-year basis, our weight per shipment was pretty low last year in the third quarter. But I think that we'll continue to keep our focus on maintaining our revenue quality. And if we can keep that revenue per shipment high, which will - we have no intent to change anything related to our pricing philosophies, a little bit lower weight per shipment, then certainly can. If you've got the same cost per shipment to handle, then that can put a little compression on that individual shipments margin. But again getting the leverage from the revenue growth, like, we talked earlier that's, if you just sort of run out for the quarter kind of this trend that we're seeing in July, you'll have significant improvement sequentially in revenue. And so, the leverage that can come from that is significant and should offset any other type of challenge that we have, typically our overhead cost average 20% to 25% of our revenue. And in the second quarter, they were about 24%. It's a period with revenue weakness. And even though the aggregate cost, absolute cost were lower on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter and they were lower in the second quarter than the first that some of the action that we took, we obviously saw a lot of the increase in those cost as a percent of revenue due to the revenue weakness. But sequentially if we can show that improvement, there - and not increase as overhead costs, you're going to get a lot of leverage there and we'd expect to be able to work that 24% back down closer to the lower end of the range. Certainly it will be the idea. And then we just got to keep the focus, and I can assure you we will on maintaining all of our labor to revenue statistics, all of our productivity across all areas of the operations, that's the biggest cost element that we have, but again when density comes back into the network as we are talking about our line-haul cost earlier, that should improve that line-haul costs that's more semi-variable. So the density coming back in the revenue, certainly, that should give us much more opportunity than any other pressures related to a little bit lower weight per shipment should present.\nAmit Mehrotra: And then, I don't if I missed it, did you talk about year-on-year tonnage in July? I wasn't sure if you had mentioned that or not?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I just generally said, July is now done and we got out of the habit of giving the number in the middle and even though we've got two days left, but given an interim month exact number and then the comparison that created and sometimes panic or sometimes exuberance that maybe neither was warranted of the change between the day of call and then what the actual number was. So I kind of talked around it, I guess, but we're down - the revenue is down about 3% sort of plus or minus at this point and we'll see where we end up with these next two days of revenue. And the weight is somewhat in that - the weight per day is somewhat in that same ballpark. So that's continued to show improvement from where we were in June. And July has been a really strong month. Typically July is a month that the revenue falls off a couple of points from June. And to see, the revenue continued to accelerate and we've actually got revenue per day that is higher in July, certainly that's a big benefits and provides us with a lot of encouragement as we go through the third quarter to see if these trends continue, because usually July is the weakest month of the third quarter. So we'll continue to see how these trends play out, but certainly gives us a lot of encouragement to see our customers continuing to reopen their business to increase the levels of business they're giving us an and some of the new wins that we've been able to create, while our sales team hasn't even really been out - be able to be out on the street, making sales calls. So it's been a coordinated effort, and our sales team got to give them a lot of credit for having to change the way they operate, how they communicate, but the coordination between our sales, cost and pricing team and continue to stay engaged and strengthen relationships with our customers. I think that's a big piece of not only our long-term numbers, but the improvement that we're starting to see as we go into the third quarter.\nGreg Gantt: Let me add that. We saw our revenue trend start to improve in June. And, so far, through the month of July, they've continued to be very consistent and they look down the line. If you look at revenue per shipment, weight per shipment per hundred and all of those different things that we measure from a revenue standpoint, they're all consistent and look very good so far. So we hope that trend will continue. But we are encouraged by not concerned at all. We are very encouraged at this point.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman.\nJordan Alliger: Just a big picture question, your service standards have always been tremendous part of competitive advantage in the LTL space. I'm just wondering, the industry itself, competition or is the competition catching up, we're doing things in the right direction. Does that impact the gap between you and the competition or is it still so head and tails above everyone else with the competitive advantage generally remains.\nGreg Gantt: Jordan, let me say, first off, everybody has service standards and filing a lot of cases they're very similar carrier-to-carrier. Ours I think are in line with most of our competitors are better. But service runs a lot wider gamut than just A to B on time. And there is still a lot that goes into service. And I think that's where OD excels compared to our competitors. And if you look at all other things that we've done over the years and we talk about the low claims ratio, but that's a big part of it. A to B on time is a big part of it. Our employees are engaged. They know what their role is, as it relates to service and they execute on that role every day. Whether it's a Dock worker or the person that answers the phone in the office and talks to our customers, how they deal with our customers. Making timely pickups, making appointment times, all of those things. There is just an awful lot of elements that go into service. And I think we measure up far better than our competitors on the day-to-day basis. And that's why I think when we sometimes lose business over price, but it comes back because of service and at the end of the day, we're getting it back and we're getting it back at our price. So there is an awful lot that goes into that. We've put a lot of work into that over the years and it's paying off. So we will continue to focus in that area and continue our commitment to our customers. So it does make a difference. Hope that answers your question.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Christine on for Ravi Shanker. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And so, maybe circling back to some of the commentary around e-commerce and sort of a tangential theme to that, are you guys seeing any or do you expect to see any sort of boring of lines between the LTL and TL operation kind of moving forward over the next couple of quarters and years, I think, the policies to be shortening on the TL side and on the LTL side, seems like the shipments are getting a little bit heavier, are you guys seeing any, again more blurring there?\nGreg Gantt: Not that we can tell to be honest with you, no. Yeah, certainly, I think as suppliers try to get closer to their customers, the TL length of haul would get shorter, but we haven't seen that trend at all in our business. I believe the haul has been very consistent over the last several years. And to be honest with you, if anything, we're seeing a little bit of an increase of late. So if there is blurring our lines, we can't see it. There is still a pretty big distinction.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then maybe just one follow-up, sort of bigger picture. As your strategy evolved at all in the last couple of months around, you know, electric vehicles, whether that's in P&D or maybe some shorter haul, other short-haul operations for you guys with some of the developments that we've seen from the OEMs in the last couple of months here?\nGreg Gantt: Well, to say this, I don't think that technology has evolved to the point that it's all that useful for us yet. There is still a lot of issues with it. I know we all hear see and read things that sound good, but I'm not sure of the practicality in our particular company, it's just not - the technology is not there yet. We can't make it work, as it currently stands today. So I think it will continue to evolve and I think there will be an application down the road and maybe sooner than later, but we'll just have to wait and see. There is still a lot of issues with it, at this point and hopefully, it will get there, but it is just not there yet.\nOperator: And that does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gantt for any additional or closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Okay, thank you all for participating today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to call us, if you have anything further. Thanks. And I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: And once again that does conclude today's conference. We thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial and operating results for the second quarter despite the operating challenges we faced with the economy. Although, our revenue declined 15.5%, we were pleased to improve our operating ratio to a quarterly record of 77.8%. We accomplished this by focusing on improving our yield, managing our variable cost, and controlling our discretionary spending. Our yield management process has strengthened the quality of our revenue and profitability over the long term. Through this process, we manage profitability on an account-by-account basis. We believe this approach is consistent and fair for our customers. Is also supportive of our ongoing investments in capacity and technology while helping offset cost inflation. We believe customers appreciate the consistency of this approach, as they know what to expect from us each year. Providing superior service at a fair price is our value proposition, which is critical to our long-term customer relationships. Our team is relentless in its commitment to providing the very best levels of service to our customers regardless of the economic environment. While we contended with many operating challenges in the second quarter, including the 16.6% decrease in shipments per day, we produced a new company quarterly claims ratio of 0.1% while also improving productivity. There are many components of our industry leading service. And based on customer feedback, we believe the gap between us and our competition has widened in the current environment. It is historically become a common practice in our industry to focus primarily on cost in a recessionary environment. This narrow focus generally leads customer service failures, which is why we are so committed to the service standards that support our revenue quality. We have long believed that this creates a competitive advantage for us in our industry and it's especially critical now because the importance of high quality and dependable service seems to have recently increased for many of our customers. As evidenced to this trend, we have been awarded new business in the past few months from customers that has historically provided lower rates rather than overall value. This trend not only leads us to believe that many of our competitors are remaining relatively disciplined with their pricing, but it is also encouraging for future market share opportunities. While the quality of our revenue is critical to our operating ratio, appropriately managing our cost is just as import. Minimizing our cost inflation on a per shipment basis is an ongoing process based largely on the productivity of our employees as salaries, wages and benefits represent our largest expense. As a result of operating efficiencies and improved productivity, we are able to improve our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter. The enforcement reality of the sudden significant reduction in revenue that occurred in April 2020 was an adjustment to our workforce to balance our employee count with available work, believing that the economy could recover quickly, we implemented an employee furlough program that initially resulted in a 15.5% year-over-year decrease in our full-time employees in April. While the economy is still recovering, our volumes increased sequentially in May and June, and we are cautiously optimistic that this accelerating trend can continue. Many of our furloughed employees have been able to return to work as a result of this improvement. We took various other measures to reduce operating expenses, while also controlling discretionary spending to reduced overhead costs. In addition, circumstances associated with the COVID-19 environment created certain cost savings that are expected to diminish in future periods, such as a reduction in group health and dental claims travel and customer entertainment. Second quarter of 2020 was one of the most difficult periods I have experienced in my career. And I am especially proud of our team's ability to respond quickly and manage our operations in this environment. I think the quality of our results shows that our business model works in both good times and bad. While certain challenges will likely continue until the economy recovers, we believe there will be long-term changes to supply chains that should create opportunities for the LTL industry. With our industry-leading service, our unmatched long-term investments in service center capacity and the dedication of our OD family of employees, I'm confident that we are in a better position than any other carrier in the industry to respond to increased customer needs for LTL services. As a result, I am also confident in our ability to continue our long term, are producing profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our quarter financial results in greater detail. Sure, Todd. No doubt in this deteriorating environment that we just came through. We did see customers more likely to put out bids and rebid the freight and that kind of thing. And that was definitely a challenge for us. And Adam mentioned, some of that - some of our - we did lose some business in that process, but we gained some from others and fortunately, in other cases, we are gaining back some revenue that we lost earlier, because of they couldn't meet the service standards that they had with us. So it's ever a challenge, that's our business. And there is always you win some you lose some. But fortunately, at the end of the day, you hope that your service outshines, the value outshines your competitors. So far so good. We are regaining some of the business that we lost. That's a good thing. We've taken on some new additional business of late. So I think there have been some opportunities that did open up for us as the quarter went all and as we roll into the third quarter, so far in the month of July, it's definitely looking strong. Yes. Coming back at our price. Right. Coming back at our price. We obviously lost it to a lower price, but that doesn't mean the customer got a greater value and it came back because of the value we provide. We, Jason, as all of our accounts, we price on based on the cost of those accounts require, and we price them accordingly. We price in the residential stop, there is a fee for that, as you know. We price them accordingly based on the cost. So I think that's an account-by-account basis, but they are not necessarily better or worse than the other businesses. At this point in time, Jason, we - maybe we have somewhat of an appetite for an acquisition. I just - I don't know who that is or exactly what that is. At this point, we're not looking at anything currently. And we always have opportunities across the desk and we evaluate those as they come along, but currently, at this time, we're not looking at anything in particular. Scott, let me say this. There were certainly some things that worked in our favor, not just ours, but probably the entire industry. Obviously the traffic congestion was a lot less than it has been in the past. We did save some money on the group health, and had less spend on customer entertainment, some marketing - areas in marketing were down from what we normally see. So there were some things that did say some short-term tight cost. But I'll say this, when this thing first started, we sat down as a management team and we made a plan. And the one thing that I made very clear was we had to execute on that plan. We didn't dillydally, we executed and I think everybody took it very serious what they had to do. Our big concern was continue to give the type of service that our customers are used to. We didn't cut anything from that standpoint, we're very pointed and determined in our efforts to continue those all of different service measures that we have and to continue to improve on those. We did it. And I think you saw it in a reduced claims and our own time percentage was still above 99%. So we did not slack off in any way, shape or form from that standpoint. And I think our customers accepted it, while we may have saw some business walk for price early in the quarter. It started to come back later in the quarter as they realize they weren't getting what they were used to with OD. So, yes, there were some areas where we did save some money. But we did a lot of the things that we had to do to help our sales from a productivity standpoint. So, yes and good. Certainly, we made a lot of things happen that we're very proud of at this point in time. As far as next year, certainly, we think that there is an opportunity to continue to have the same type of productivity levels of improvement that we had in the second quarter. You can, measure it from there. We certainly expect our revenue growth to come back. Not exactly sure where that's going at this point in time. Who knows where the economy is going to go, we're facing a lot of things later this year and on in the next year with the election year and all that, but a lot of challenges ahead, but we do definitely think, if we have some growth that we can drive however lower. I don't think there's any doubt about it as we've said before, we think we can manage through the good times and the bad. I think we've proven that in the past, but I don't think there's any doubt. We will continue to prove that into the future. We did see increases on those e-commerce type accounts. We did see some big revenue jumps with those particular accounts on the inbound side for us particularly. I think you know we don't participate in a lot of home deliveries and that kind of thing, but there is another end of that. So we did see some upticks on those accounts, which is a good thing. And that was really what those comments we're pointed towards. I think we'll continue to see those type of customers business basis grow. So I think that's a good thing for us generally speaking. Those accounts, Ariel, they have practically everything, they have a very, very wide variety of products. So, yes, each account that goes into those is vastly different, but they are all priced accordingly. So I don't think there is anything different generally speaking than with a lot of our other accounts, but we will price them accordingly. Regardless of the product. Yes - I was just going to add that we've seen growth over the last couple of years in our retail-related business. It's close to 30% of our overall revenues that were still closely align with the industrial sector. But, nevertheless, that business has been growing. So this has been a trend that's been evolving but certainly accelerating in this environment and things are going to completely change overnight. In terms of supply chains and whatnot, but certainly we feel like that more fulfillment centers, things of that nature, as they continue to be built around both the landscape and much of the freight that will be inbound those fulfillment centers will be more conducive to the LTL type quantity shipments. And so we certainly believe that we've already been winning business in that area and can continue because to be able to maintain the manage inventory quantities and the number of SKUs that they want to have in those facilities. You've got to have tight inventory controls and that requires confidence in your carrier to deliver on time and without damage and certainly, I think we've proven that we do that better than anyone and I think that we'll be able to continue to participate and that element of the business continuing to give us a little market share. I mean certainly there will be some costs that will come back into the business and we'll be prepared for those, but there should be other cost savings opportunities. Keep in mind with the big drop in revenue that we saw typically when you look long term it's the density, the revenue per service factors is that has increased the operating ratio has improved and when we look at individual service centers and regions around the country. We know that we've got ongoing opportunity to improve our operating ratio and it really is driven down to the service center level. When you look and think about all the dollars that we've invested over the years and expanding our door capacity and then the individual opportunity to improve the service centers ratio, all those 238 service centers roll up into the company average. And you might have some that we've just expanded and maybe curve, the operating ratio, but you've got a much larger group that we're leveraging all the fixed cost there because we own most of our facilities, and so it gives us confidence that we can continue to drive this operating ratio lower once the density factors come back, but it's the density and the yield and both of those generally require a positive economic backdrop to support each. Those are the two key really to drive long-term operating ratio improvement and we're going to continue to focus on those. It's a matter of managing revenue quality and cost and we've got to consistently do both. We've got to continue to look for ways that we can keep our cost inflation low while continuing to also give the service to our customers that provides value and allows us to get the consistent rate increases that we need as well and so this just continues to build on itself and also allows us to do. The most important thing and that's taken care of our employees and keep them motivated keep on them engaged to continue to give service to be productive that employee and our family culture that we have is really what's been driving our long-term success. When we want to make sure that we don't miss out on that element as well. Let me add that. We saw our revenue trend start to improve in June. And, so far, through the month of July, they've continued to be very consistent and they look down the line. If you look at revenue per shipment, weight per shipment per hundred and all of those different things that we measure from a revenue standpoint, they're all consistent and look very good so far. So we hope that trend will continue. But we are encouraged by not concerned at all. We are very encouraged at this point. Jordan, let me say, first off, everybody has service standards and filing a lot of cases they're very similar carrier-to-carrier. Ours I think are in line with most of our competitors are better. But service runs a lot wider gamut than just A to B on time. And there is still a lot that goes into service. And I think that's where OD excels compared to our competitors. And if you look at all other things that we've done over the years and we talk about the low claims ratio, but that's a big part of it. A to B on time is a big part of it. Our employees are engaged. They know what their role is, as it relates to service and they execute on that role every day. Whether it's a Dock worker or the person that answers the phone in the office and talks to our customers, how they deal with our customers. Making timely pickups, making appointment times, all of those things. There is just an awful lot of elements that go into service. And I think we measure up far better than our competitors on the day-to-day basis. And that's why I think when we sometimes lose business over price, but it comes back because of service and at the end of the day, we're getting it back and we're getting it back at our price. So there is an awful lot that goes into that. We've put a lot of work into that over the years and it's paying off. So we will continue to focus in that area and continue our commitment to our customers. So it does make a difference. Hope that answers your question. Not that we can tell to be honest with you, no. Yeah, certainly, I think as suppliers try to get closer to their customers, the TL length of haul would get shorter, but we haven't seen that trend at all in our business. I believe the haul has been very consistent over the last several years. And to be honest with you, if anything, we're seeing a little bit of an increase of late. So if there is blurring our lines, we can't see it. There is still a pretty big distinction.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $896.2 million, which was a 15.5% decrease from the prior year. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which contributed to our earnings per diluted share of $1.25 for the quarter. Our revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 12.1% decrease in LTL tons and a 3.8% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Decrease in the average price of diesel fuel reduced our fuel surcharges, which had an impact on our topline revenue as well as our yield, excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight decreased 0.5% due primarily to the significant increase in weight per shipment. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being the average length of haul and weight per shipment. Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in our mix. As a result, revenue per hundredweight is a tough measure to evaluate, when the mix of our business changes so significantly like it did during the second quarter. While the change in revenue per hundredweight might suggest otherwise, we continue to negotiate rate increases during the second quarter and believe underlying pricing trends remained relatively consistent. We believe revenue per shipment is a better measurement, as we focus internally on maintaining a positive spread between our revenue and cost per shipment. The 4.9% increase in revenue per shipment excluding fuel surcharges, for the second quarter, was relatively consistent with the change in the first quarter of 2020, as well as our long-term trends. With respect to our revenue trend during the second quarter, revenue per day on a year-over-year basis was down 19.3% in April, but then sequentially improved in the remaining months of the quarter. Average revenue per day in June, for example, was down 11.4% as compared to June 2019. Our change in volumes also followed a similar pattern. On a sequential basis, LTL shipments per day decreased 15.7% in April as compared to March 2020. Shipments per day then increased 9.7% from April to May and increased 7.1% from May to June. The sequential acceleration and shipments in revenue has continued into July. With only a couple of days remaining in the month, our current revenue per day is trending down approximately 3% plus or minus. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 10 basis points to 77.8%, which was a record for us despite the significant decline in revenue. More than two-thirds of our costs are variable or semi-variable and our team was effective in matching these costs with the change in revenue, while also controlling our discretionary spending. Our operations team also did an outstanding job with improving efficiencies during the quarter. We have historically improved productivity during recessionary environments and from experience, we believe we can maintain, much of this productivity once we return to a growth environment. While the loss of revenue certainly had a deleveraging effect on our fixed cost, the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $312.2 million and $516.2 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2020 respectively, while capital expenditures were $67.9 million and $120.1 million for the same periods. We returned $146.1 million of capital to our shareholders during the second quarter and $342.7 million for the first half of the year. For the year-to-date period, this total included $306.8 million of share repurchases and $35.9 million in cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter 2020 was 25.7% as compared to 26.1% in the second quarter of 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. I don't know that we've heard a shift in tone at any point recently. Certainly, our approach is always one to consistency and I think that's what our customers appreciate. They know what to expect out of us and we're pretty disciplined in that respect to focus on what our cost inflation is every year and the pricing, the operating ratio on an account-by-account basis that, that we try to target with our customer accounts as well. So, for us, we just continue on with our consistent approach and we've been getting increases all year long. I mean, in some cases, in the early part of this quarter, that may have impacted some of our volumes as well. But like we mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some volumes coming back to us, that's been an encouraging trend, and some of the business that we may have lost back in April. Some of that business coming back to us just based on the service that they received from the other carrier that they might have switched to. And when they look and think about the total value equation, they didn't feel like they were getting the value there and they came back to us. So that's what we'll continue to focus on is just our consistent long-term type of approach to offset cost inflation that's workforce and that's what we intend to continue. Yes, it's typically is about a 50 basis point deterioration from the second to the third, but in a normal environment, which clearly we are in, and we would have seen the second quarter revenue of about 10% over the first quarter and then third quarter increase is slightly typically from the second quarter. So you get, historically speaking, most of your operating ratio improvement there in the second quarter on a sequential basis, that is. And so, in this environment, if we can keep this accelerating revenue trend, then some of the leverage that we lost particularly in overhead and within that overhead category on the depreciation, we lost quite a few basis points there from the first and the second quarter. So, if we can continue this revenue trend and revenue can meet or exceed than where we were in the first quarter, then certainly that depreciation in particular unwinds, and there should be some other costs that we unwind along with that. And we fully expect to try to maintain the productivity that should continue, certainly there will be some costs that will be coming back online in the third quarter. But given all of those factors, we certainly think that we should definitely be able to beat what that long term deterioration is simply, if nothing else, just the improvement that we should have the leverage on the depreciation. The weight per shipment is certainly been a wild swing since the trend that we had back in January and February, right when things started changing our weight per shipment increased above 1,600 pounds in March, it reached a peak of 1,677 pounds in April and then it started working its way back to sort of a - more of an average that we've seen over the longer term of about 1,600 pounds. It was right at 1,600 pounds in June. And most of that was in the early stages of some of the stay at home orders. We had more national account business that remained open. Our national account business typically has a higher weight per shipment than our smaller mom-and-pop type of accounts. And so, now some of those smaller accounts are starting to come back online. But we're still getting, I would say more business from our national accounts. They continue to be strong. And when you think about some of the companies that are performing well in this environment and that have increased demand, it's a lot of those bigger on the retail side, some of those bigger retailers and their weight per shipment just continues to be much heavier. So it's a little bit different mix. But we're happy to see it kind of coming back to the 1,600 pound range. And we expect that is more of the smaller accounts come back online. It could drift down a little bit lower, but that 1,600 pound range is continued into the July at this point. And so, if we can see that stay around that sort of level for the time being, that'd be a good trends and contributor too to the overall revenue per shipment that we're seeing. We kind of stopped talking about the - our average contract renewals. And some of that, we hear others kind of give the same commentary and be it average increases in contracts or general increases, never seen the fully reconcile even factoring in changes in weight per shipment to what some of the others might report as their revenue per hundredweight. And so I would just say that, that looking at revenue per shipment and how that's trended, that's more in line with what we've been able to achieve with increase is kind of on average. And typically that's been between 4% to 5% and that's somewhat falls in alignment as well. We have a general rate increase that went into effect earlier this year, that was at 4.9%. And that's generally the target that we have for our contracts as well. So, in that ballpark is really what our long-term trend has been. It's what we continue to target. And it's what we've been able to achieve this year. So that it's been a good thing. Obviously, the long-term success of that program, managing our cost where there is a positive delta between our revenue per shipment and our cost per shipment managing those two factors has really been a key contributor to our long-term operating ratio improvement. Yes, I mean certainly that creates some opportunities for us. And it really just gets back to our sales team, their discussions and ongoing conversations with our customers what their customer needs are. And if they've got freight that needs to be moved and we can help out, obviously volumes are off for us. Even though they're getting better, there is still down on a year-over-year basis. So we've got capacity and we're ready to help our customers whenever we can. If that's a heavier weighted shipment that might have moved by truckload, there is no such thing as bad freight, there is poorly priced freight. So if we understand all the shipment characteristics and have got good pricing practices in place, which I believe we do, then certainly we're willing to handle about any shipment that a customer would want us to. The best thing that we would see that the changing trends in the truckload world would be that if the truckload rates continue to increase. Typically, that has the effect of increasing many of our competitors cost structure. Many of our competitors use outsourced truckload for purchase transportation. So if our competitors now have got some unexpected cost inflation, that's going to put more rate pressure for themselves to go back and increase their rates typically that has the effect too of moving normal LTL business our way. So multiple opportunities I think both from a direct and indirect basis for the truckload world improving. Yes, I mean certainly that was a benefit. Our overall fringe rate though in the second quarter was 33.6%. And we typically target about 34%. I think that at the beginning of the year, that was something that we talked about. And so just the change and we were at 34% in the second quarter of last year. So those numbers are pretty comparable from period-to-period, but probably resulted, I would just say fringes overall and $2 million, $1 million to $2 million of savings comparing what we had this quarter versus what the fringe rate was in 2Q of '19. So a little savings there. There is always sort of puts and takes in that fringe type of number, certainly we were fortunate, I guess, if you will, to see that group health and dental was down and some of the others were up. And on a sequential basis, simply having more income in the second quarter than the first that drives things like our 401(K) match that we give to our employees and it's things like that continuously improving our benefits overall and giving more paid time off and doing some of these things that continue to motivate our employees, and we think helps drive the bottom line success as well. They understand the success. They drive for the company. They get rewarded for it. So we think that's been a very motivational tool over the years for our employees and helping our culture. Sure. Yes, we didn't give the specifics on the productivity, but saw really strong performance, our platform shipments per hour for the quarter improved 7.1%, our P&D shipments per hour improved 4.2%, even our line haul light mode average had improved 0.8%. And we talked about before that, that not all cost are variable, and running this line-haul network that we have serving 238 service centers, there is a fixed element of running that cost, but I was really pleased with all the level of productivity that we had and as such. When you look at our productive labor cost on a per shipment basis. So again getting things back to how they are per shipment, overall they were right at about 3% cost inflation. And that's pretty much in line with the wage increase that we gave last year. So we had improvement. We don't give this level of detail, but our P&D and our Dock costs per shipment were essentially both flat and then we had a little inflation overall in line-haul. But that would be expected based on that trend. I'd say, an update on the headcount. Overall, in June, we were down - the full time employees were down 10.5% just comparing June of this year to June of last year. So we brought many people back from the furlough program. If you look and compare April to June. The headcount is up about 4.5 overall, but if you compare kind of where we are today to where we were in March, we're down about 1,400 positions overall, which is about 7%. And based on where we are, our shipments per day should be higher in July than they were back in March. So that was kind of what we've talked about in the prepared remarks that unfortunately when we go through an environment like this, we've made adjustments like, we have, but you find areas of productivity when each department leader is going through evaluating their costing and costs don't save them sales. It takes action and a plan. We've gone through and we've figured out ways to be able to do more with less. And I think that's what we're seeing now. But if our accelerating trends continue, we certainly will have to continue to bring back some more employees, we fully expect and we'd like to that, because they go hand in hand with the increase in volumes. But I think overall when you look at sort of the level of headcount with the volumes, those should come back in alignment and eventually show some improvement there. Jason, we do not measure the number of residential deliveries that we had. And I did anecdotally hear a whole lot of commentary about additional residentials. I know we had a few more in one segment of our business, but I don't think we saw a significant uptick in residentials at all. Yes. A lot of that is mainly on the tonnage. And so you've got some of the yield, if you will, sequentially that, that's moving up a little bit, but yeah, we're continuing to see acceleration essentially on the shipments and the time and our yields continue to perform as well. But overall, it's good to see. Obviously that coming back closer to kind where we were last year after going through the second quarter and revenue being down double-digits and certainly it feels a lot easier to manage and should produce a lot more opportunities, once we can get back to the revenue being flat and eventually get back to a growth environment, which is what we're more used to. Dave, we've tried to structure our fuel tables to really where they don't really impact us on the bottom line, too much one way or the other. We got hurt a little bit a few years ago back in '16 and really didn't have the lower end of our table where it needed to be, but we address that throughout the year and then fully address that when the next GRI came about. So net-net, we try to do some back of the envelope type of calculations and believe it was fairly minimal, on a net basis. Maybe overall slightly good. But the hard thing to try to negotiate and do these back of the envelope type of calculations is the simple fact that fuel is just another element that's pricing, that's negotiated with our customers. So, if you've got somebody that, that wants to make in this environment look like their base rates were that, that they didn't take an increase, but we got an overall improvement in our fuel contribution or some other type of element that really gives us the same level of revenue then that just becomes a tool to negotiate with. So it's really hard to try to make that comparison. But I'll say that the change on the call side, I mean obviously it hit us hard on the topline. And then on the cost side, you see the change and the improvement in the operating supplies and expenses, a big driver of that not all of it, but a big driver of that was the decrease in fuel typically when fuel changes so significantly like that in a period, you'd see the corresponding increase in your labor cost. And I think that hit kind of mask the overall improvement, if you will, to keep our labor cost essentially flat like we did in this environment with the surcharge revenue being down so much. It was really impressive to me and I thought that was the biggest driver in our ability to improve the operating ratio was what we were able to accomplish with all of those labor cost as a percent of revenue. Well, there is two elements that go into that insurance and claims line, that's our auto accidents. We call it BIPD. The bodily injury and property damage in the cargo claims. And fortunately for us, our cargo claims has consistently improved and almost non-existent at a record 0.1% for this most recent quarter. So that element has come a long way. You go back to the recession, when I felt like we really differentiated ourselves the great recession of '09, when we really differentiated ourselves from our competition. We are above 1% and we believe that, that's where the industry average is likely still north of 1% from the data that we get and feedback from customers. So that's a good thing that we've consistently driven that claims ratio down. On the auto side, certainly this year and it's in the second quarter, like most of the other carriers, we're facing significant inflation with our insurance rates, but we've been very fortunate with the fact that all the investment in new equipment and safety systems and training and so forth that we've made over the years, those all have accident mitigation type of tools with them. And our tractors now and then just continuous training on the Dock and other places and that we've done. And so there is an element that goes into this line, there is an element in our salaries, wages and benefits that goes hand in hand with those safety programs. And we continue to see workers' comp which is in the benefit line to improvement there. And so I think it's just, it's been a focus of our company that have safety programs in place and always be trying to continuously improve those and I think we've seen a big benefit, the insurance line is one, but, there is a hidden one that's in the fringe benefit line on the workers' comp that goes hand-in-hand. So if we can just keep our accident frequency ratios low those continuously improve and try to keep severity low as well and some of that's mitigated by the investment in technology on the tractors. And hopefully we can keep that line item consistent like it has been in that 1% to 1.2% type of range. Yes, I mean, certainly there are a lot of moving parts right now as we work our way through this environment. And so, yes, sequentially, the weight per shipment is coming down, but all up on a year-over-year basis, our weight per shipment was pretty low last year in the third quarter. But I think that we'll continue to keep our focus on maintaining our revenue quality. And if we can keep that revenue per shipment high, which will - we have no intent to change anything related to our pricing philosophies, a little bit lower weight per shipment, then certainly can. If you've got the same cost per shipment to handle, then that can put a little compression on that individual shipments margin. But again getting the leverage from the revenue growth, like, we talked earlier that's, if you just sort of run out for the quarter kind of this trend that we're seeing in July, you'll have significant improvement sequentially in revenue. And so, the leverage that can come from that is significant and should offset any other type of challenge that we have, typically our overhead cost average 20% to 25% of our revenue. And in the second quarter, they were about 24%. It's a period with revenue weakness. And even though the aggregate cost, absolute cost were lower on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter and they were lower in the second quarter than the first that some of the action that we took, we obviously saw a lot of the increase in those cost as a percent of revenue due to the revenue weakness. But sequentially if we can show that improvement, there - and not increase as overhead costs, you're going to get a lot of leverage there and we'd expect to be able to work that 24% back down closer to the lower end of the range. Certainly it will be the idea. And then we just got to keep the focus, and I can assure you we will on maintaining all of our labor to revenue statistics, all of our productivity across all areas of the operations, that's the biggest cost element that we have, but again when density comes back into the network as we are talking about our line-haul cost earlier, that should improve that line-haul costs that's more semi-variable. So the density coming back in the revenue, certainly, that should give us much more opportunity than any other pressures related to a little bit lower weight per shipment should present. Well, I just generally said, July is now done and we got out of the habit of giving the number in the middle and even though we've got two days left, but given an interim month exact number and then the comparison that created and sometimes panic or sometimes exuberance that maybe neither was warranted of the change between the day of call and then what the actual number was. So I kind of talked around it, I guess, but we're down - the revenue is down about 3% sort of plus or minus at this point and we'll see where we end up with these next two days of revenue. And the weight is somewhat in that - the weight per day is somewhat in that same ballpark. So that's continued to show improvement from where we were in June. And July has been a really strong month. Typically July is a month that the revenue falls off a couple of points from June. And to see, the revenue continued to accelerate and we've actually got revenue per day that is higher in July, certainly that's a big benefits and provides us with a lot of encouragement as we go through the third quarter to see if these trends continue, because usually July is the weakest month of the third quarter. So we'll continue to see how these trends play out, but certainly gives us a lot of encouragement to see our customers continuing to reopen their business to increase the levels of business they're giving us an and some of the new wins that we've been able to create, while our sales team hasn't even really been out - be able to be out on the street, making sales calls. So it's been a coordinated effort, and our sales team got to give them a lot of credit for having to change the way they operate, how they communicate, but the coordination between our sales, cost and pricing team and continue to stay engaged and strengthen relationships with our customers. I think that's a big piece of not only our long-term numbers, but the improvement that we're starting to see as we go into the third quarter."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. First quarter seems like a distant memory at this point, but we were pleased with our financial results for the quarter. We improved our operating ratio to a new first quarter company record and our diluted earnings per share also increased. These were notable achievements given how challenging the first quarter was as both revenue and tonnage were down. We were cautiously optimistic at the beginning of 2020, as we believed the operating environment will turn positive. Our volumes were trending in line with normal seasonality for the fourth quarter of 2019, and January and February 2020 results were in line with our initial expectations. Things changed in the middle of March, however, and we began to realize the profound impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the country and the general business environment.  While no one could have fully anticipated the effects of this pandemic, the situational awareness guiding our response was developed from the crisis management planning exercises that our team periodically performs. One of the most critical things we focused on during training in this importance of timely communication with our employees, customers and vendors. As a result, we were well-prepared to communicate early and often with these stakeholder groups as we address the rapidly-changing environment. While no plan will be perfect in these types of situations, our response was coordinated, quick and effective. Once again, proving the flexibility of our people and our business. I believe our response has also demonstrated the true importance of what we have repeatedly characterized as the foundation of our success, our culture. We have long believed that our culture has differentiated us from our competition and the difference becomes most evident during challenging times. With that in mind, the safety and wellbeing of our OD family of employees was and continues to be our first priority as we address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have followed guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization related to employee health and safety, while also adhering to any national, state and local mandates within the areas we serve. Among our many initiatives, we have distributed face coverings to our employees, increased the cleanings of our facilities, limited non-employee visitors, established social distancing practices and provided resources for our employees to clean and disinfect our trucks and workplaces.  We also provided non-executive employees with a special bonus payment as a way of thanking them for their extraordinary effort in serving our customers through this pandemic. The trucking industry is crucial to help ensure the availability of groceries, medical supplies and other essential products around the country. We are proud of the response of our OD family of employees as we continue to deliver best-in-class service. In terms of how we have responded to the rapid decrease in business levels associated with the stay-at-home and similar orders around the country, we have continued to focus on our value proposition of providing superior service at a fair price. In fact, we produced a record quarterly claims ratio of 0.16% in the first quarter. Our service performance has supported our ongoing price discipline, which is critical to our long-term success.  Without our long-term improvement in yields, we would have not have been able to support investments in capacity, nor improve on our superior service standards over the years. The importance of high-quality and dependable service seems to have also recently increased for many of our customers, which further supports our existing business model. We are fortunate to have so many large national account customers that remain open for business. Although these customers continue to ship goods, often on an accelerated basis, many of our customers are currently closed. As a result, our volumes dropped off pretty significantly at the beginning of April, but they have remained fairly steady ever since. This has allowed us to quickly adjust to our new daily shipments counts. The unfortunate reality of the sudden and significant reduction in revenue, however, has been a necessary adjustment to our workforce. In this case, and with the belief that business levels will be restored once the economy reopens, we implemented an employee furlough program. The duration of this program will provide health benefits for these employees at no cost and they will also retain their seniority with the company.  Other measures to reduce costs have included parking certain equipment to minimize maintenance expense, while also improving the efficiency of our fleet. We discussed on our fourth quarter call that our fleet was already a little heavy as we enter 2020, which was why our capital expenditures for equipment was lower than normal this year. We will still incur monthly depreciation cost for all of our units, but this strategy allows us to maintain adequate equipment capacity for the foreseeable future. We are currently experiencing an environment unlike anything we have ever seen, but we continue to be confident that our business model works up and down the economic cycle. A majority of our costs are variable and we are doing an excellent job of managing our costs in relation to the drop in revenue. A rapid decrease in business and ongoing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment add difficulty to our decision making process. We have quickly adjusted while also simultaneously preferring how we will manage increased business levels when volumes return. We are also encouraged by recent news that certain states are in the process of allowing various businesses to reopen. I believe our country will return as strong as ever and fully realize that responding to rapid growth can be difficult.  We know this from experience as we have seen many periods with 20% plus revenue growth. I am confident that our past experience, existing capacity and dedication of the OD team puts us in a better position than any other carrier to respond to increased customer needs whenever that time comes. I'm incredibly proud of our employees for both our performance in the first quarter and their response to this pandemic. Our employees are on the frontlines and clocking in everyday, so that OD can continue helping the world keep promises.  Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. \nAdam Satterfield : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $987 million, which was a 0.3% decrease from the prior year. The first quarter of 2020 included one extra workday, so the decrease per day was 1.9%. Our operating ratio improved 60 basis points and our earnings per diluted share increased to $1.11. These results include $10.1 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to employees in March. Our revenue results for the first quarter reflect the 3.9% reduction in LTL tons that was partially offset by the 2.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight.  Excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.3%. While this growth rate was lower than recent periods, our yields were negatively affected by the 1.3% increase in weight per shipment.  Our yield numbers for the month of March were flattish as compared to the same period of 2019, due primarily to a 6.3% increase in weight per shipment. It is important to understand revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement that is not always equivalent to actual pricing. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being average length of haul and wait for shipments.  As an example, our average weight per shipment increased 113 pounds from February to March this year, and this contributed to $0.56 sequential decrease in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. The last time our average weight per shipment changed so quickly was the 60 pound decrease from June, July of 2018, which led to a $0.54 sequential increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges.  Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in mix. We continue to negotiate rate increases as we work through bids in accordance with our long-term pricing philosophy. We also believe the price environment remains relatively rational considering the significant drop in demand due to COVID pandemic.  Our first quarter operating ratio improved 60 basis points to 81.4%, due primarily to the quality of our revenue and increased operating efficiencies. These efficiencies allowed us to effectively improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue in the first quarter. Our average headcount also decreased 5.2% as compared to the 5.1% decrease in average shipments per day.  In regards to our April top-line trends, revenue per day is down close to 20%. Our average weight per shipment has increased close to 10%, while shipments are trending slightly worse than revenue. Decrease in revenue also reflects reduced fuel surcharges as the average price of diesel fuel is 20% lower than it was in April 2019. Our actual results have been slightly better than we initially expected when the stay-at-home and similar orders were implemented throughout the country. We take no solace in that fact however and eagerly await the reopening of markets around the country. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for April in our 10-Q.  Due to the unprecedented decrease in revenue we experienced in April, we implemented the furlough program in attempt to balance the number of employees actively working with current freight trends. As a result, our current number of active employees has decreased approximately 15%, as compared to April 2019. While the loss of revenues will have the de-leveraging effect on our fixed cost, approximately two-thirds or more of our costs are variable or semi-variable. We will continue to make our best efforts to match these costs with revenue, while also controlling discretionary spending. We will not over cut expenses though as we believe we are the best positioned LTL carrier to capitalize on an improving economy. Therefore, we want to ensure that we have the people, equipment and door capacity in place to support our customers when the economy and business levels return to normal. We're fortunate to have the balance sheet strength to provide us with this flexibility. Old Dominion's cash at the end of the first quarter totaled $357 million and our outstanding debt totaled only $45 million. We have approximately $200 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit and we also have communicated with our traditional lenders to discuss additional sources of liquidity if needed. In addition, we continue to generate strong cash flow from our business. Our cash flow from operations totaled $204 million for the first quarter while capital expenditures were $52.2 million. We returned $196.6 million of capital to our shareholders during the first quarter, including $178.3 million of share repurchases and $18.3 million cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 26.3% as compared to 26.1% in the first quarter 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.3% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we will go first to Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So, I guess to start off and Adam thank you very much for that color there in terms of what you're seeing so far in April. And it's encouraging to hear that the competitive environment remains relatively rational right now. Could you maybe talk for a moment about, are you seeing issues with share loss in certain markets or anything like that going on or do you feel like market share in general is fairly stable and our customers at all trying to kind of push back on rates and maybe trying to take advantage of sort of what's happening out there, just given this drop in tonnage over the last call it three, four weeks?\nAdam Satterfield: Jack, this is Adam. I think customers or certain customers are always pushing back on price regardless of the environment. With that said, right now, I think about every customer is getting some form of a rate reduction just by the sense that fuel surcharges are down so much and the significance of the surcharge that it can be on each customer's freight bill. So that is happening due to the 20% reduction in the cost of diesel fuel right now and the impact for each customer's freight bill in that regard. Otherwise for us, just like we said the pricing philosophy and the discipline that we've had over the years have been critically important to supporting the investments that we've made in our service centers and our service. And so we had no intention of wavering on that in this regard. And at this point, we haven't seen really any competitive behavior that\u2019s really no different than what we saw basically in the last half of last year. So I think things have been pretty disciplined in this regard thus far. And in the past recession, you saw a lot of companies that financed rate reductions through cutting employee wages and doing some other things like that. And we haven't necessarily seen those types of actions at this point either. And, in fact we just saw one other LTL company, we saw yesterday that will also be announcing I think a similar company bonus program like we had. So that would suggest that the other companies hopefully will be just as disciplined with respect to their yield management process such that we are. \nJack Atkins: Okay, that's great to hear. And then I guess for my follow up question, you guys are coming into this crisis with such a strong balance sheet, loss of liquidity. How are you guys thinking about the opportunity for industry consolidation as we emerge from this over the next couple of years? And even though you're reducing CapEx this morning, sort of what's going on make you consider perhaps leaning into to this to some degree and trying to take advantage of what's probably going to be a more consolidated LTL market on the other side of this? \nGreg Gantt: Jack, this is Greg. That's possible, I suppose. But I think things that we've done over the last several years in trying to expand our capacity, trying to build on our terminal network and give us capacity in all the different markets that we service and particularly the big metro markets that are so critical to our future growth and whatnot. I think that's the correct strategy as we go through this. Where it comes out on the other side, we\u2019ll just have to wait to see. But again, I think we've done the right things to prepare for whatever that might be if we lose a competitor or not. Again, I think we've done the right things. I think our capital expenditure investments will help us on that side whatever it is. So feel good about it. Who knows? I don't really want to speculate on this kind of thing.\nOperator: We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi. \nChris Wetherbee: And just a point of clarification, I think it\u2019s helpful to give sort of the shipment color relative to where April revenue per day was trending a little bit weaker than revenue. Is that fair to say that sort of tonnage is the same relationship? I would imagine the answer is yes. But just want to make sure I understood, maybe some puts and takes that could be going on just given the mix shifts that we're seeing? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. The mix in the businesses that we're seeing that are still open, weight per shipment has been much heavier than what it normally is. And I think some of that, there's probably multiple factors driving it, but some of that is just respect to which customers remain open and the fact that there's probably more demand for those customers\u2019 products. But nevertheless, the comments which are broad and rounded, just to give a sense of direction for you guys. But we're down on the revenue per day basis, close to 20%. The shipments per day are trending worse than that, but our weight per shipment is up almost 10%. So, tonnage then obviously is going to be trending better, but that big increase in the weight per shipment is also having the negative effect on reported yields like what we have already seen in March. So, changing dynamics and whenever things start to reopen, obviously at some point things will stabilize and we'll get back to more of your normal book of business and so forth. But right now we are seeing a much heavier weight per shipment across the board with the freight that we're handling.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's helpful. I guess that sort of leads into the second question, which would just be about, the discussions you've had with the customers, I know it's really difficult to sort of make predictions about what's happening from a volume perspective, but do you feel like there is sort of non-essential pieces of the business where customers are shut down and so we sort of have seen this level of activity here in late April is kind of what it feels like the bottom will be or close to the bottom will be, and then maybe we could see some potential customers opening as we move forward through the rest of the quarter or is it too difficult to tell or is another further leg down there? I know, it's difficult but any color you could give would be great.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly difficult to tail at this point. We're trying to reach out to as many customers as we can. We'd like to think that the worst is behind us. We've kind of gone through this initial period where trying to figure out, which customers are open, which of our customers\u2019 customers are also open, and so that we're not picking up freight that can't be delivered and all of those present operational challenges and communication challenges. But many of our customers, they're not sure what to expect either, as they began to reopen. So, I think there is uncertainty across the board, but if we can continue to see states start a re-opening process and then I think we've got to go through the mental process for every American to figure out how they will react once businesses are open. And when we get back to normal and what the new normal means, may take some time for us to get there. But certainly, we are ready and in place. We've got all forms of capacity that are ready to support our customers when their shipping needs increase and somewhat get back to normal.\nOperator: We'll go next to Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Just given that this looks to be the first time we'll see a sequential decline in revenues, at least going to back 20 years and pretty meaningful like that. Would you still expect to see sequential OR improvement? Maybe if you could speak to that?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think that typically the second quarter is where we give the OR improvement. But you're typically seeing revenue accelerate. Typically, our second quarter revenue is about 10% higher than the first quarter, and I think what happens from a revenue basis obviously, will drive what happens with the operating ratios if things stay lower than -- we -- like we mentioned, we have adjusted many of our variable costs at this point already to this lower environment. But I think that it just remains to be seen. The revenue levels in the second quarter be higher than the first or consistent or lower, that's just still the ongoing uncertainty. But what we can say is that we have made cost adjustments. I feel good about how our direct operating costs are trending already, despite how quickly revenue did drop off. And we're looking to keep those as best we can consistent or maybe even try to generate improvements versus the first quarter. And then it just becomes a function of the overhead costs which the overhead costs we say typically run 20% to 25% of our revenues, closer to the 20%, they\u2019ve averaged probably 22% over the last few years, but close to that lower end of the spectrum when revenue trends are solid. And then it's been higher than that or on the higher end. Last was back in the recessionary environment of 2009.  So that will be the flex. But within those overhead costs, there are some variable costs there as well that we'll continue to try to manage. But not all of our direct operating costs are completely variable as well. And it takes tremendous cost to keep the network running. We've got 238 service centers today. We've got to continue to run our line haul schedules and keep our service metrics high. We're really pleased to see that our own time service remains above 99%. And we did produce the new claims ratio in the first quarter.  So all of that takes tremendous effort, especially when there's some significant freight reduction and challenges in terms of how one service center is operating today versus how it was a month and a half ago. So it's taking a coordinated effort between our sales and operations teams. We're really proud of the results that we've produced and the adjustments on the call side that we've been able to see so far in April. \nAllison Landry: And then just in terms of CapEx. And I know that that's been scaled back. But is there a way to think about maybe an absolute floor just to the extent that conditions are worse for longer? How should we think about maybe just sort of your sort of maintenance CapEx level? But if you could provide some color on that, that would be helpful. Thank you. \nAdam Satterfield: Our normal maintenance CapEx, we kind of say on any annual year would be maybe $200 million to $250 million. But we're already into this year's CapEx plan which only included $20 million of -- related to equipment. We're already into that part of the program, those will not be canceled, and some of that equipment has already been delivered as well. But on the real estate side, where the investments that we're making today really aren't supporting the growth that we would expect to see next year. There in many cases supporting growth that we may see over the next five years. So it's important for us to, in some cases, keep those projects going so that the capacity is available in particularly places where we have been tighter, the West Coast and the Northeast, some parts of the Midwest, some of the metro areas. It's really tough to get permits and do things. And so we want to keep the process going to make sure when volumes come back, particularly with a chance they can come back in a very rapid way that we've got all forms of capacity to deal with freight flows later this year but for the next several years.  But with that said, our normal annual planning process, we look at each of our service centers, what we think anticipated volumes may be over the next few years, and we focus our efforts on where prices are tight, in a slow period and much like we did in '08, '09 we will also look for opportunities. So, while the gross number today reflected some projects that we felt good about being able to defer, if an opportunity becomes available in an area that we know we need capacity at some point in the future, then we would certainly look at existing service centers and how they might be able to work into our long-term plan.\nOperator: We will go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So, Adam, maybe you can offer some help. So we've never seen weight per shipment up so much. I don't think we're ever seen rev per hundredweight down so much as it's going to be down. Help us think about what that actually means for the P&L, is this good or bad for earnings? Good or bad for -- does it help decrementals, hurt decrementals? And then maybe just like any good sort of rule of thumb of how to translate this? How does higher weight per shipment impact core pricing and any good rule of thumb there?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I don't know that there is a rule of thumb and some of that detail I gave in prepared comments, it's just simply not linear in terms of when you look at changes in the weight per shipment per say and how that might reconcile to revenue per hundredweight. But frankly, we're in a period where we've not seen this type of a change in weight per shipment before. Normally, it would be in an environment where the economy was really strong. The weight per shipment we saw increase kind of in the middle and end of March. I think initially a lot of that was, it seemed like, the truckload world was tightening in some places that was concerned about. Our anecdotal evidence we had was concern for some carriers to drive into a particular market and not be able to get payload out. And so, you had customers that were just trying to use capacity in any way they could. And so, maybe some heavier loads came away. Some of the stay-at-home orders were put in place, I think that we saw some of our small mom-and-pop accounts that might be closed. And so, probably more of the business that we're handling being larger national accounts, they typically have a higher weight per shipment as well. And then like I mentioned earlier, just the sheer fact that if they are essential goods, there was probably an increased demand for those. And so, there was just more widgets on every shipment that we were picking up in that regard. But, that will settled down in some regard. And in terms of how it affects overall profitability, again it\u2019s just every customer must stand on its own. That's the basis of what our pricing philosophy is. And if each customer, if we know the revenue stream both of the base rates and how we stress test the fuel surcharge, variable component of the revenue, and then we know the cost inputs then that's what we try to look at in terms of managing account-by-account profitability. That said, I mentioned that we've done a good job I think in managing our direct operating costs, and keeping those somewhat consistent as a percent of revenue despite the significant disruption that we face. So all of those cost inputs should be covered and it just becomes matter of on the big picture level what revenue in total might look like in elements of the overhead like our depreciation in particular, what type of increases we might see there. So overall it's not a bad thing to see the increase weight per shipment, usually on just a per shipment basis. It's a better thing you get a little bit more revenue per shipment when the cost to handle would be the same. But right now it's just obviously very fluid with what we're actually picking up and continuing to work through the system and the network as we speak.\nScott Group: Yes, I mean, I guess I'm still not sure the answer right. I hear wafer shipment typically is good. You also have -- maybe there's more national account business which I sometimes think is bad for OR. So, again, any additional thoughts or color on how to -- how we should think about this translating to the OR would be helpful? And then I'll just add to that, how should we think about fuel, historically lower fuel can be a headwind for LTL earnings. Is that still the case? Or do we not need to think about that anymore?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that for the most part, we try to adjust our fuel tables to be able to have the same level or similar level of profitability by account as the fuel prices are higher or lower. So obviously, we're getting lower fuel surcharges right now, but the costs are down as well. And in regards to just the operating ratio, the only thing I can say is that what we've already said we're trying to from a big picture standpoint. And one thing, we don't manage our national accounts any different from our smaller accounts, each should stand on their own from an operating ratio standpoint. So having more of one business is not necessarily a bad thing if we got that balanced out right from a pricing standpoint. But right now, if we can hold our own with managing our direct operating costs, which are typically around 58% to 60% of revenue, if we can keep those flattish, it\u2019s then just trying to minimize any increase in the overhead type of costs, any inflation that we might see in those costs items as a percent of revenue, given the overall big picture revenue weakness that we're seeing in April.\nOperator: We'll go next to Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nQ - Todd Fowler: Great. Thanks. And good morning. Adam, I wanted to ask about the headcount. First, I wanted to make sure, the 15% reduction that you talked about, is that from first quarter levels are is that year-over-year? And then what's the right way to think about the portion of the expense that you're still keeping? Is the health and wealth -- is the healthcare costs still about a third of the total expense or is it something different than that?\nAdam Satterfield: The 15% of the year-over-year, so that's compared to April of last year. Really didn't have any kind of material action in the first quarter. The 5% decrease really was just a function of kind of the ending headcount that we finished in December of last year. The headcount drifted down a little bit, but we had talked on the last quarter's call about the fact that we felt like we could handle growth, and we were just letting some natural attrition continues to take place. So it drifted down a little bit, but the April number is what reflects the furloughs that were put in place. So that's down, not quite as much, obviously as the number of shipments. But certainly we want to make sure we've got people capacity in place in the event that things turn back on and we continue to see volumes come in the network. So, feel good about kind of where we are in that regard and we'll continue to move forward and just evaluate on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis kind of where we are with volumes and revenue and how we\u2019re managing our people capacity.  In regards to the benefits, we had kind of said I think coming into this year that about 34%, so about a third as you said, as a percent of salaries and wages was the target. We did a little bit better than that in the first quarter. That number in the first quarter was about 32.5%. So, it\u2019s somewhere around of a third to 32% to 34% is probably likely, maybe a little bit higher, since we are covering the healthcare cost of furloughed employees. So, that might tick up albeit at the higher end of that scale, and kind of what our target was coming into this year.\nTodd Fowler : Okay. That helps. And then just for my follow-up, as you look out, if we don't see kind of a significant snap back in volumes or tonnage going forward, are there other levers that you can pull within the network to kind of adjust some of the costs? And then kind of along the same lines, would your expectation be that you might have to pay some additional retention bonuses similar to what you did in 1Q for the work that your employees are doing? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: We are already making cost adjustments in areas like general supplies and expenses and some of our miscellaneous expense items as well. So we're making every effort to eliminate cost where we can and where it makes sense and in terms of just overall kind of revenue levels, and I think Greg mentioned this in his prepared remarks is that, the good news is things have kind of settled in and our revenue levels have been very consistent. That certainly helps us from a planning standpoint, and makes it -- if not easy, but it makes it a little bit easier versus if the revenue on each day of the week was very inconsistent and choppy. So, we've been pleased to see that stability with the revenue and then we'll continue to see where we go from here. But, against our earlier comments, I feel like that we're getting to the point where we're well into this pandemic and now that it seems like some of it's coming under control and some markets are beginning to talk about reopening, you'd like to think that the worst is behind us and that we've hit a floor. But that's something that we look at each and every day and will continue to stay on top of and we're going to manage our costs to whatever the revenue level trends are.\nTodd Fowler: And can you share any thoughts on additional bonuses? And if you don't want to, I understand.\nGreg Gantt: We haven't talked about that at this point in time. So, we'll see where that goes. But we have not discussed that so.\nTodd Fowler : Okay.\nGreg Gantt: Todd, keep in mind too, a lot of our expenses are down just because of the way we've changed and things that we do on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis like travel, entertainment, and some of our marketing expenses are down. So we have covered an awful lot of expenses that we normally incur in business as usual. But there's a lot of things that are turned off that certainly will help our bottom-line when it\u2019s all said and done.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Ari Rosa with Bank of America.\nAri Rosa : So for my first question, I just wanted to get a little more clarity there. And I know Scott was kind of hitting on this. But just maybe if you could talk a little more about the mix of business that's driving up the weight per shipment. Is that more tilted towards kind of retail and essential goods? I presume it is. And then is there an ability or even a desire on your guys part to increase the exposure to those end markets, if you could, on a more sustainable basis?\nAdam Satterfield : It's I would just say the long-term trend has certainly been that we've seen more growth in retail-related business. Not any kind of necessary change or any difference in that regard for what we saw in the first quarter. Most of those were trending, somewhat in line. And what we've seen in April, as you can imagine, we\u2019ve got exposure to agricultural on food and food distributors and things like that, that have been good and any type of manufacturing that would go into those types of things or other medical-related and chemical-related type of products as well. So that's kind of been the areas that have performed and have continued to give us business, if you will, in April. While some other things that if it's -- you can just sort of think about the basics and the places that are continuing to be open for business in terms of what products might be moving or not. So -- but not any kind of wholesale change. But long-term, as we've said multiple times, we think there will continue to be more of a change with respect to retail supply chains and move towards having some type of e-commerce type of presence and how that -- or the ripple effects of that throughout the nation supply chain. And we'll be in place where much of the focus on the retailers that are making those types of changes has been on carriers that offer higher service levels. And so that's been a tailwind for our business in recent years. And the fact that our service levels helped many of our customers avoid fines and charge backs and things like that, that many retailers are putting in place.\nAri Rosa : Great. That's great color. And then just for my follow-up, maybe you could talk about how you think this compares to kind of the 2008-2009 period? And then, you said that you're seeing kind of rationality still in pricing among the LTL carriers. But maybe you could talk about the extent to which you think there's kind of elasticity on pricing for LTL as an industry if pricing is collapsing on the truckload side. It seems like typically, when you see higher weight per shipment, that's some truckload movements flowing into the LTL side. But with pricing down on the truckload side, how elastic is the pricing for LTL carriers as a whole?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. In terms of how we entered the recession in '08 and '09, it was we sort of eased into it. The fourth quarter of '08 was down about 5% or 6%, and then we kind of went down to somewhere between 15% -- 15% to 20% drop in revenue in the first quarter of '09, and then it kind of got to its worst in the second quarter. And now, obviously, we just faced a sudden drop off in April. And really, at the end of March, we didn't necessarily see a drop-off in freight levels at the end of March. It was lower than what we expected. But really, it was, we didn't get the end of quarter buildup that we typically see. And it may have been a little bit soft, but I think that many customers still had kind of orders in the chain, if you will, and we continue to make some of those deliveries. So we held somewhat steady, if you will, from the middle of March towards the end and just missed the normal kind of end of quarter buildup. But now, and kind of as we anticipated, we saw the rapid drop-off in April, and it's obviously much harder to respond to that type of change and to be able to keep the network of 238 service centers remaining fluid and our service metrics high. So I've been really impressed with the operations team and how they've made these adjustments cutting out costs, minimizing empty miles. Our dock productivity is up. P&D productivity is looking good as well and when you think about that, I mean, our miles between stops, those types of things become more challenging when you got some customers that are closed and it just makes that job function that much more difficult and lack of efficiency. But it all goes back to the fact that over the years and the experience that our team has, we've got a lot of experience, and we've got a lot of technology in place to kind of help us plan, but it's not artificial intelligence, it's human ingenuity that's been able to keep our system running in a very efficient manner and we're really pleased with how quickly the team has adapted to these abrupt changes of just revenue falling off a cliff like the half.\nAri Rosa : And could you guys touch maybe on the ability of the LTL industry as a whole to protect pricing if it's collapsing on the truckload side?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that as we've seen in recent years and even going back to when we were slower in 2016, we believe that LTL would continue to be disciplined. Just this year, in fact, that it's so consolidated with 80% of the revenue being in the top 10 carriers. And then when you look at many of the carriers' margins, it's not really in a position to really go out and try to trade price for volume. In fact, it's probably better to go out and try to implement more of an increase to try to shore up their profit levels. So we felt like that LTL pricing would stay more consistent, and it's held fairly steady. We faced some spotty issues last year and dealt with those. And we'll always continue to see spotty issues, and that happens even in good times. So we believe that pricing is critically important. It's obviously been very supportive to us over the years to make sure that we're getting price increases to offset our cost inflation and to support the investments that frankly customers are demanding of us to continue to support technology investments and support capacity infrastructure as well. So we believe that we'll continue to see relative discipline out of the Group, and there's still a benefit of moving freight by LTL. We were like ridesharing before ridesharing was cool. And you're sharing every customer is sharing the cost of the freight. And it's cheaper to move shipments that are less than 10,000 pounds by riding on the truck with some other customer versus the truckload world. And even when they try to dip down and do multi-stock network is not really conducive to doing that. Their equipment is not and their drivers aren't paid to make multiple stops like ours are. So I think the industry remains strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined with respect to price, relatively speaking.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. So good morning, Greg. You guys referenced this a little bit in your commentary, but are you able to quantify what percentage of your customer base is SMB versus large customers and maybe essential versus nonessential?\nGreg Gantt : Well, we've got about 60% of our customers are contract type customers, and those are just going to be larger in nature. And in terms of essential versus non-essential, I mean, to a certain degree, about everyone's essential. And -- but certainly, we've got some smaller mom-and-pop accounts that are closed for business right now. But overall, we're seeing for down about 20% and then I'd say probably 80% is essential, if you will. That's for the most part about -- all of it's moving right now.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. So Greg, you're saying 80% of your customers would be essential, obviously, not from your perspective, but from a government perspective. And so 80% of our customers are actually moving stuff right now?\nGreg Gantt: That's roughly the case. We cannot accurately measure everything that we haul, whether it's essential or not. But we've got a lot of different measures that we've got in place. And it's something that we're actively working on trying to determine just exactly what groups they all fall into. But we don't know exactly if everything that we haul is essential or not.\nRavi Shanker : And just lastly, again, referring back to some of the commentary about share shifts and comparison to '08 and such. Obviously, a big focus for 2020 coming into the year pre-COVID while the kind of supply side catalysts on the TL side with maybe some spillover effect on the LTL side, are you sharing of any accelerated bankruptcies with mom-and-pop carriers, just given some of the supply side restrictions on the -- whether it's driver clearing house or the insurance costs, which obviously even impact LTLs as well that's made worse by the environment?\nGreg Gantt: We know of a lot of truckload carriers that have bankrupted or just closed, whatever. I'm not exactly sure how many that is. I read some article this week. There were a couple of thousand that had closed. But as you know, most on the truckload side, there's thousands and thousands that are like less than 10 drivers. So we know some of those have closed and gone away, but certainly haven't seen that on the LTL side.\nOperator: And we'll go next to David Ross with Stifel.\nDavid Ross : Yes, Greg, I guess when you guys mentioned, you didn't see a drop-off in March, and you got into April and things just fell off a cliff. And Adam, you talked about it not being a normal downturn where you see it down 5%, then maybe it gets a little bit worse over the weeks and months. But when you see it go from flat or down a few percent to down 20% in the span of 24 hours or a couple of days, how do you react to that? I mean, Greg, what are you seeing in the network with the volumes? And then what do you do in terms of shifting things around in such a short period of time?\nGreg Gantt: Well, good question, Dave. We could see it to some degree that it was coming because, as Adam mentioned before, we did not get the normal end of the month, end of the quarter like we would typically get. It was off. I'm not sure, maybe 15%, 20% versus normal end of the month, end of the quarter. So we saw it coming, we weren't completely in the dark. And obviously, as we kept hearing about all these shelter-in-place orders that were issued. I think at that time, it covered about 37, 38 states, something like that. Certainly, all the major markets in the country had gone to that. So we had some information, and trust me, we were prepared to deal with it well ahead of time. So obviously, we couldn't make all the adjustments that we wanted to with the snap of a finger, but we were well prepared to do it at the first of the month. And a lot of the adjustments that we made were at the first of the month. We've made some since and we'll continue to do so if need be. But we've got a lot of information out there that we look at and measure, the customers closing and all that kind of thing. And there is a lot of information flowing in and out that helped us make decisions.\nDavid Ross : What are the one or two I guess, what are the one or two things that you look at it first when you wake up in the morning, Greg? What do you focus on in terms of managing through this and the volume variability?\nGreg Gantt: We obviously have all the different shipment measures, the revenue levels shipments tonnage, all those things, we look at it on a company level and a region level as well. But we'll measure all those things, see where we are. Obviously, you've got to try to somehow compare the workforce to the business levels. We've done it before. So it's not fun, but it's not anything new. We managed through it in '08, '09 and similar downturns, smaller downturns through the year. So it's a little different, but obviously, we got to do it. So not fun, I can tell you that.\nDavid Ross : Well, unlike the other ridesharing companies, you guys at least make money through the ups and downs. So congratulations.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks. So I think, again, as Adam mentioned earlier, it's a tribute to the team. And I can tell you, we've worked extremely close over the last month or so, particularly, and everybody is on board with what we're doing. We've had numerous, numerous conference calls and numerous meetings within the walls of the building and a lot going on.\nOperator: We'll go next to Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra : I got disconnected mid-call. So just let me know if my question has already been asked, and I'll just go back to the transcript. But Adam, I was hoping that you could kind of provide the typical sequential shipment trends from April to May, May to June? I know this year, it's completely crazy, but it would just be helpful to understand kind of the normal sequential seasonality in the shipments as you see it historically?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. The April -- on a shipments per day basis, April shipments are typically a 0.9% higher than March, and May is 3.2% higher than April, and June is 1.8% higher than May.\nAmit Mehrotra : And then that down 20% year-over-year -- sorry, that was in shipment. But what is the normal seasonality sequentially in April that you've seen so far versus that number that you just talked about?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, obviously, if things are down about 20%, I hadn't really calculated necessarily for how it looks into a sequential, but that would put us down about somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% or so versus shipment levels for March.\nAmit Mehrotra : And then the other little nuance point I wanted to ask on the headcount, the furlough program. Is there any impact to the comp and wages per employee? I'm not sure if that program impacts the population mix that may be inflates wages per employee, just something that we should be thinking about in the second quarter.\nAdam Satterfield: Not on the wage side, we did talk about the fact that they will we are covering the cost of the benefits those so the fringe benefit will likely be a little bit higher right at the higher end of our normal range, if you will, as a percent of salaries and wages.\nAmit Mehrotra : Okay. And then obviously, you guys have a great reputation of running an incredibly efficient network. And that's a great track record. And one thing I want to understand is, as I measure kind of the line haul efficiency, is there any way you can help us think about how full the trucks are on any given period or a typical period? I'm just trying to understand like the change the potential change in load factors as you move from 1Q to 2Q, given kind of, I assume those numbers are pretty high and partly reflects the efficiency of the network. But any help around kind of load factors and how we think about that?\nAdam Satterfield: Obviously, load factor is something that we manage and watch on a daily basis. Unfortunately, so far, month to day, the load factors have actually improved some. You've got to keep in mind that we have multiple schedules in all of our lanes. And in a lot of cases, you just end up reducing those schedules in cases where we're down. But we do manage that very closely. And again, fortunately, month-to-date, our load factors have shown some improvement.\nAmit Mehrotra : Is that the best -- is that an effective proxy for margins? Or are there just so many other moving parts that load factor is one piece of it, but I'm just trying to understand, is that effective proxy for like the overall margin trends?\nGreg Gantt: I think you have to look at all different aspects of line haul or miles, empty miles and those kind of things. But I think load factor is the biggest thing that we can manage by. We certainly look at a key factor and that kind of thing as well. But so far, it looks okay.\nAmit Mehrotra : Okay. And then the last question I have very quickly is, Adam, there's a lot of questions around weight per shipment and how should we think about it in the context of margins and fixed cost absorption? And I just want to isolate for weight per shipment is really the question. So obviously, you guys manage expenses on a shipment basis, and that obviously makes sense. But if we were to keep everything equal, specifically pricing equal, the changes in weight per shipment, obviously, will translate to revenue per shipment, higher weight per shipment will translate to revenue per shipment higher, all else equal. But does that higher revenue come with disproportionate margins because you're managing the expenses on shipments? And so I'm just trying to really conceptually isolate weight per shipment, how to think about the drop-through from the revenue associated with that.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I talked around that earlier in the call. So I'll point you back to the transcript or either we can follow-up later.\nOperator: We'll go next to Ben Hartford with Baird.\nBen Hartford: Adam, just real quick. You mentioned two-thirds cost being variable or semi-variable. What would that figure have roughly looked like say five and 10 years ago? Has that number, that proportion risen over time? And if so, why is it density? Is it internal initiatives to variabilize costs? Can you provide a little bit of perspective just over time, how that's trended?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, over time, the operating ratio level that we've improved, most of the improvement has come in those direct operating costs, which most of which are variable. So we've got an improvement over the years, and our overhead costs have stayed relatively consistent as a percent of revenue. But we've always, in our history, tried to work on operating efficiencies, and we have a continuous improvement process that focuses on quality and we've always made efforts through technology improvements and just general process improvement to try to optimize mainly labor cost as a percent of revenue. And so that's just that's been a focus. It will continue to be a focus. And we feel like that's an area where you've got the ongoing opportunity for operating ratio improvement. But it takes the ingredients for long-term operating ratio improvement are density, which obviously we don't have right now. And then a yield improvement process that tries to cover our cost inflation. And so over time, we've been able to leverage the additional density through the network. That too drives operating efficiencies and OR improvement. And then just having that yield contribution there. Both of those require the macroeconomic support, though. But that, it's definitely improved. Our direct operating costs have been the biggest area of improvement over the long run.\nBen Hartford: Is it fair to say that as density has built over the past decade that, that proportion has risen, though?\nAdam Satterfield: Of variable costs?\nBen Hartford: Yes.\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know that it's risen. It's certainly an area where we've been able to get improvement, though, in those costs as a percent of revenue.\nBen Hartford: Okay. Just on the customer set, the 3PL customers that you do business with, has that proportion changed meaningfully over the course of the past month or two, have you seen 3PLs more active as a percent of your total business or less?\nGreg Gantt: It's probably a little early to tell. We haven't even completed one month of this. It's probably a little too soon to tell if they've had a significant change or not.\nOperator: And we'll go next to Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group : Thank for the quick follow up. So Greg, you made a comment earlier about something to the effect of if we lose a competitor. And I guess I'm curious just if you think that you're gaining any share from that competitor right now or any sort of outsized share given potential concerns there? And then maybe if you could just share any sort of thoughts or on contingency plans you guys have in place or anything like that?\nGreg Gantt: No, I'm not sure I want to say any more than I said prior in relation to that. But certainly, we can't tell if we're gaining any share from anybody at this point. Again, we've been through some three weeks of this pandemic so far. Obviously, our business is down, as I suspect most of our competitors' business is down, similarly to ours. But I couldn't begin to say if we've gained share from anybody at this point. We just don't know. Again, I always say from a standpoint of being prepared to gain share, to gain additional business should something happen, I think we have done the right things over the last several years. I think you all are well aware of the capital expenditures that we've made in our real estate over the last several years, in particular. We're continuing to make investments this year in our real estate. So I think we're doing the right things to be as prepared as we could possibly be. We're more concerned about our business, hopefully, coming back soon than losing a competitor. So we'll see what happens with that. But we really don't want to speculate on that.\nOperator: And there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn it back over to Mr. Gantt for any additional or closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: And that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. First quarter seems like a distant memory at this point, but we were pleased with our financial results for the quarter. We improved our operating ratio to a new first quarter company record and our diluted earnings per share also increased. These were notable achievements given how challenging the first quarter was as both revenue and tonnage were down. We were cautiously optimistic at the beginning of 2020, as we believed the operating environment will turn positive. Our volumes were trending in line with normal seasonality for the fourth quarter of 2019, and January and February 2020 results were in line with our initial expectations. Things changed in the middle of March, however, and we began to realize the profound impact the COVID-19 pandemic would have on the country and the general business environment.  While no one could have fully anticipated the effects of this pandemic, the situational awareness guiding our response was developed from the crisis management planning exercises that our team periodically performs. One of the most critical things we focused on during training in this importance of timely communication with our employees, customers and vendors. As a result, we were well-prepared to communicate early and often with these stakeholder groups as we address the rapidly-changing environment. While no plan will be perfect in these types of situations, our response was coordinated, quick and effective. Once again, proving the flexibility of our people and our business. I believe our response has also demonstrated the true importance of what we have repeatedly characterized as the foundation of our success, our culture. We have long believed that our culture has differentiated us from our competition and the difference becomes most evident during challenging times. With that in mind, the safety and wellbeing of our OD family of employees was and continues to be our first priority as we address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have followed guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization related to employee health and safety, while also adhering to any national, state and local mandates within the areas we serve. Among our many initiatives, we have distributed face coverings to our employees, increased the cleanings of our facilities, limited non-employee visitors, established social distancing practices and provided resources for our employees to clean and disinfect our trucks and workplaces.  We also provided non-executive employees with a special bonus payment as a way of thanking them for their extraordinary effort in serving our customers through this pandemic. The trucking industry is crucial to help ensure the availability of groceries, medical supplies and other essential products around the country. We are proud of the response of our OD family of employees as we continue to deliver best-in-class service. In terms of how we have responded to the rapid decrease in business levels associated with the stay-at-home and similar orders around the country, we have continued to focus on our value proposition of providing superior service at a fair price. In fact, we produced a record quarterly claims ratio of 0.16% in the first quarter. Our service performance has supported our ongoing price discipline, which is critical to our long-term success.  Without our long-term improvement in yields, we would have not have been able to support investments in capacity, nor improve on our superior service standards over the years. The importance of high-quality and dependable service seems to have also recently increased for many of our customers, which further supports our existing business model. We are fortunate to have so many large national account customers that remain open for business. Although these customers continue to ship goods, often on an accelerated basis, many of our customers are currently closed. As a result, our volumes dropped off pretty significantly at the beginning of April, but they have remained fairly steady ever since. This has allowed us to quickly adjust to our new daily shipments counts. The unfortunate reality of the sudden and significant reduction in revenue, however, has been a necessary adjustment to our workforce. In this case, and with the belief that business levels will be restored once the economy reopens, we implemented an employee furlough program. The duration of this program will provide health benefits for these employees at no cost and they will also retain their seniority with the company.  Other measures to reduce costs have included parking certain equipment to minimize maintenance expense, while also improving the efficiency of our fleet. We discussed on our fourth quarter call that our fleet was already a little heavy as we enter 2020, which was why our capital expenditures for equipment was lower than normal this year. We will still incur monthly depreciation cost for all of our units, but this strategy allows us to maintain adequate equipment capacity for the foreseeable future. We are currently experiencing an environment unlike anything we have ever seen, but we continue to be confident that our business model works up and down the economic cycle. A majority of our costs are variable and we are doing an excellent job of managing our costs in relation to the drop in revenue. A rapid decrease in business and ongoing uncertainty about the macroeconomic environment add difficulty to our decision making process. We have quickly adjusted while also simultaneously preferring how we will manage increased business levels when volumes return. We are also encouraged by recent news that certain states are in the process of allowing various businesses to reopen. I believe our country will return as strong as ever and fully realize that responding to rapid growth can be difficult.  We know this from experience as we have seen many periods with 20% plus revenue growth. I am confident that our past experience, existing capacity and dedication of the OD team puts us in a better position than any other carrier to respond to increased customer needs whenever that time comes. I'm incredibly proud of our employees for both our performance in the first quarter and their response to this pandemic. Our employees are on the frontlines and clocking in everyday, so that OD can continue helping the world keep promises.  Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Jack, this is Greg. That's possible, I suppose. But I think things that we've done over the last several years in trying to expand our capacity, trying to build on our terminal network and give us capacity in all the different markets that we service and particularly the big metro markets that are so critical to our future growth and whatnot. I think that's the correct strategy as we go through this. Where it comes out on the other side, we'll just have to wait to see. But again, I think we've done the right things to prepare for whatever that might be if we lose a competitor or not. Again, I think we've done the right things. I think our capital expenditure investments will help us on that side whatever it is. So feel good about it. Who knows? I don't really want to speculate on this kind of thing. We haven't talked about that at this point in time. So, we'll see where that goes. But we have not discussed that so. Todd, keep in mind too, a lot of our expenses are down just because of the way we've changed and things that we do on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis like travel, entertainment, and some of our marketing expenses are down. So we have covered an awful lot of expenses that we normally incur in business as usual. But there's a lot of things that are turned off that certainly will help our bottom-line when it's all said and done. Well, we've got about 60% of our customers are contract type customers, and those are just going to be larger in nature. And in terms of essential versus non-essential, I mean, to a certain degree, about everyone's essential. And -- but certainly, we've got some smaller mom-and-pop accounts that are closed for business right now. But overall, we're seeing for down about 20% and then I'd say probably 80% is essential, if you will. That's for the most part about -- all of it's moving right now. That's roughly the case. We cannot accurately measure everything that we haul, whether it's essential or not. But we've got a lot of different measures that we've got in place. And it's something that we're actively working on trying to determine just exactly what groups they all fall into. But we don't know exactly if everything that we haul is essential or not. We know of a lot of truckload carriers that have bankrupted or just closed, whatever. I'm not exactly sure how many that is. I read some article this week. There were a couple of thousand that had closed. But as you know, most on the truckload side, there's thousands and thousands that are like less than 10 drivers. So we know some of those have closed and gone away, but certainly haven't seen that on the LTL side. Well, good question, Dave. We could see it to some degree that it was coming because, as Adam mentioned before, we did not get the normal end of the month, end of the quarter like we would typically get. It was off. I'm not sure, maybe 15%, 20% versus normal end of the month, end of the quarter. So we saw it coming, we weren't completely in the dark. And obviously, as we kept hearing about all these shelter-in-place orders that were issued. I think at that time, it covered about 37, 38 states, something like that. Certainly, all the major markets in the country had gone to that. So we had some information, and trust me, we were prepared to deal with it well ahead of time. So obviously, we couldn't make all the adjustments that we wanted to with the snap of a finger, but we were well prepared to do it at the first of the month. And a lot of the adjustments that we made were at the first of the month. We've made some since and we'll continue to do so if need be. But we've got a lot of information out there that we look at and measure, the customers closing and all that kind of thing. And there is a lot of information flowing in and out that helped us make decisions. We obviously have all the different shipment measures, the revenue levels shipments tonnage, all those things, we look at it on a company level and a region level as well. But we'll measure all those things, see where we are. Obviously, you've got to try to somehow compare the workforce to the business levels. We've done it before. So it's not fun, but it's not anything new. We managed through it in '08, '09 and similar downturns, smaller downturns through the year. So it's a little different, but obviously, we got to do it. So not fun, I can tell you that. Thanks. So I think, again, as Adam mentioned earlier, it's a tribute to the team. And I can tell you, we've worked extremely close over the last month or so, particularly, and everybody is on board with what we're doing. We've had numerous, numerous conference calls and numerous meetings within the walls of the building and a lot going on. I think you have to look at all different aspects of line haul or miles, empty miles and those kind of things. But I think load factor is the biggest thing that we can manage by. We certainly look at a key factor and that kind of thing as well. But so far, it looks okay. It's probably a little early to tell. We haven't even completed one month of this. It's probably a little too soon to tell if they've had a significant change or not. No, I'm not sure I want to say any more than I said prior in relation to that. But certainly, we can't tell if we're gaining any share from anybody at this point. Again, we've been through some three weeks of this pandemic so far. Obviously, our business is down, as I suspect most of our competitors' business is down, similarly to ours. But I couldn't begin to say if we've gained share from anybody at this point. We just don't know. Again, I always say from a standpoint of being prepared to gain share, to gain additional business should something happen, I think we have done the right things over the last several years. I think you all are well aware of the capital expenditures that we've made in our real estate over the last several years, in particular. We're continuing to make investments this year in our real estate. So I think we're doing the right things to be as prepared as we could possibly be. We're more concerned about our business, hopefully, coming back soon than losing a competitor. So we'll see what happens with that. But we really don't want to speculate on that. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you all have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $987 million, which was a 0.3% decrease from the prior year. The first quarter of 2020 included one extra workday, so the decrease per day was 1.9%. Our operating ratio improved 60 basis points and our earnings per diluted share increased to $1.11. These results include $10.1 million of expense related to the special bonus paid to employees in March. Our revenue results for the first quarter reflect the 3.9% reduction in LTL tons that was partially offset by the 2.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight.  Excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 3.3%. While this growth rate was lower than recent periods, our yields were negatively affected by the 1.3% increase in weight per shipment.  Our yield numbers for the month of March were flattish as compared to the same period of 2019, due primarily to a 6.3% increase in weight per shipment. It is important to understand revenue per hundredweight is a yield measurement that is not always equivalent to actual pricing. Multiple factors can have a significant impact on revenue per hundredweight, most notably being average length of haul and wait for shipments.  As an example, our average weight per shipment increased 113 pounds from February to March this year, and this contributed to $0.56 sequential decrease in revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. The last time our average weight per shipment changed so quickly was the 60 pound decrease from June, July of 2018, which led to a $0.54 sequential increase in revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges.  Changes in revenue per hundredweight are also not linear with respect to changes in mix. We continue to negotiate rate increases as we work through bids in accordance with our long-term pricing philosophy. We also believe the price environment remains relatively rational considering the significant drop in demand due to COVID pandemic.  Our first quarter operating ratio improved 60 basis points to 81.4%, due primarily to the quality of our revenue and increased operating efficiencies. These efficiencies allowed us to effectively improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue in the first quarter. Our average headcount also decreased 5.2% as compared to the 5.1% decrease in average shipments per day.  In regards to our April top-line trends, revenue per day is down close to 20%. Our average weight per shipment has increased close to 10%, while shipments are trending slightly worse than revenue. Decrease in revenue also reflects reduced fuel surcharges as the average price of diesel fuel is 20% lower than it was in April 2019. Our actual results have been slightly better than we initially expected when the stay-at-home and similar orders were implemented throughout the country. We take no solace in that fact however and eagerly await the reopening of markets around the country. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for April in our 10-Q.  Due to the unprecedented decrease in revenue we experienced in April, we implemented the furlough program in attempt to balance the number of employees actively working with current freight trends. As a result, our current number of active employees has decreased approximately 15%, as compared to April 2019. While the loss of revenues will have the de-leveraging effect on our fixed cost, approximately two-thirds or more of our costs are variable or semi-variable. We will continue to make our best efforts to match these costs with revenue, while also controlling discretionary spending. We will not over cut expenses though as we believe we are the best positioned LTL carrier to capitalize on an improving economy. Therefore, we want to ensure that we have the people, equipment and door capacity in place to support our customers when the economy and business levels return to normal. We're fortunate to have the balance sheet strength to provide us with this flexibility. Old Dominion's cash at the end of the first quarter totaled $357 million and our outstanding debt totaled only $45 million. We have approximately $200 million of borrowing capacity on our revolving line of credit and we also have communicated with our traditional lenders to discuss additional sources of liquidity if needed. In addition, we continue to generate strong cash flow from our business. Our cash flow from operations totaled $204 million for the first quarter while capital expenditures were $52.2 million. We returned $196.6 million of capital to our shareholders during the first quarter, including $178.3 million of share repurchases and $18.3 million cash dividends. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2020 was 26.3% as compared to 26.1% in the first quarter 2019. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 26.3% for 2020. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Jack, this is Adam. I think customers or certain customers are always pushing back on price regardless of the environment. With that said, right now, I think about every customer is getting some form of a rate reduction just by the sense that fuel surcharges are down so much and the significance of the surcharge that it can be on each customer's freight bill. So that is happening due to the 20% reduction in the cost of diesel fuel right now and the impact for each customer's freight bill in that regard. Otherwise for us, just like we said the pricing philosophy and the discipline that we've had over the years have been critically important to supporting the investments that we've made in our service centers and our service. And so we had no intention of wavering on that in this regard. And at this point, we haven't seen really any competitive behavior that's really no different than what we saw basically in the last half of last year. So I think things have been pretty disciplined in this regard thus far. And in the past recession, you saw a lot of companies that financed rate reductions through cutting employee wages and doing some other things like that. And we haven't necessarily seen those types of actions at this point either. And, in fact we just saw one other LTL company, we saw yesterday that will also be announcing I think a similar company bonus program like we had. So that would suggest that the other companies hopefully will be just as disciplined with respect to their yield management process such that we are. Yes. The mix in the businesses that we're seeing that are still open, weight per shipment has been much heavier than what it normally is. And I think some of that, there's probably multiple factors driving it, but some of that is just respect to which customers remain open and the fact that there's probably more demand for those customers' products. But nevertheless, the comments which are broad and rounded, just to give a sense of direction for you guys. But we're down on the revenue per day basis, close to 20%. The shipments per day are trending worse than that, but our weight per shipment is up almost 10%. So, tonnage then obviously is going to be trending better, but that big increase in the weight per shipment is also having the negative effect on reported yields like what we have already seen in March. So, changing dynamics and whenever things start to reopen, obviously at some point things will stabilize and we'll get back to more of your normal book of business and so forth. But right now we are seeing a much heavier weight per shipment across the board with the freight that we're handling. Yes. Certainly difficult to tail at this point. We're trying to reach out to as many customers as we can. We'd like to think that the worst is behind us. We've kind of gone through this initial period where trying to figure out, which customers are open, which of our customers' customers are also open, and so that we're not picking up freight that can't be delivered and all of those present operational challenges and communication challenges. But many of our customers, they're not sure what to expect either, as they began to reopen. So, I think there is uncertainty across the board, but if we can continue to see states start a re-opening process and then I think we've got to go through the mental process for every American to figure out how they will react once businesses are open. And when we get back to normal and what the new normal means, may take some time for us to get there. But certainly, we are ready and in place. We've got all forms of capacity that are ready to support our customers when their shipping needs increase and somewhat get back to normal. Yes. I think that typically the second quarter is where we give the OR improvement. But you're typically seeing revenue accelerate. Typically, our second quarter revenue is about 10% higher than the first quarter, and I think what happens from a revenue basis obviously, will drive what happens with the operating ratios if things stay lower than -- we -- like we mentioned, we have adjusted many of our variable costs at this point already to this lower environment. But I think that it just remains to be seen. The revenue levels in the second quarter be higher than the first or consistent or lower, that's just still the ongoing uncertainty. But what we can say is that we have made cost adjustments. I feel good about how our direct operating costs are trending already, despite how quickly revenue did drop off. And we're looking to keep those as best we can consistent or maybe even try to generate improvements versus the first quarter. And then it just becomes a function of the overhead costs which the overhead costs we say typically run 20% to 25% of our revenues, closer to the 20%, they've averaged probably 22% over the last few years, but close to that lower end of the spectrum when revenue trends are solid. And then it's been higher than that or on the higher end. Last was back in the recessionary environment of 2009.  So that will be the flex. But within those overhead costs, there are some variable costs there as well that we'll continue to try to manage. But not all of our direct operating costs are completely variable as well. And it takes tremendous cost to keep the network running. We've got 238 service centers today. We've got to continue to run our line haul schedules and keep our service metrics high. We're really pleased to see that our own time service remains above 99%. And we did produce the new claims ratio in the first quarter.  So all of that takes tremendous effort, especially when there's some significant freight reduction and challenges in terms of how one service center is operating today versus how it was a month and a half ago. So it's taking a coordinated effort between our sales and operations teams. We're really proud of the results that we've produced and the adjustments on the call side that we've been able to see so far in April. Our normal maintenance CapEx, we kind of say on any annual year would be maybe $200 million to $250 million. But we're already into this year's CapEx plan which only included $20 million of -- related to equipment. We're already into that part of the program, those will not be canceled, and some of that equipment has already been delivered as well. But on the real estate side, where the investments that we're making today really aren't supporting the growth that we would expect to see next year. There in many cases supporting growth that we may see over the next five years. So it's important for us to, in some cases, keep those projects going so that the capacity is available in particularly places where we have been tighter, the West Coast and the Northeast, some parts of the Midwest, some of the metro areas. It's really tough to get permits and do things. And so we want to keep the process going to make sure when volumes come back, particularly with a chance they can come back in a very rapid way that we've got all forms of capacity to deal with freight flows later this year but for the next several years.  But with that said, our normal annual planning process, we look at each of our service centers, what we think anticipated volumes may be over the next few years, and we focus our efforts on where prices are tight, in a slow period and much like we did in '08, '09 we will also look for opportunities. So, while the gross number today reflected some projects that we felt good about being able to defer, if an opportunity becomes available in an area that we know we need capacity at some point in the future, then we would certainly look at existing service centers and how they might be able to work into our long-term plan. Yes. I don't know that there is a rule of thumb and some of that detail I gave in prepared comments, it's just simply not linear in terms of when you look at changes in the weight per shipment per say and how that might reconcile to revenue per hundredweight. But frankly, we're in a period where we've not seen this type of a change in weight per shipment before. Normally, it would be in an environment where the economy was really strong. The weight per shipment we saw increase kind of in the middle and end of March. I think initially a lot of that was, it seemed like, the truckload world was tightening in some places that was concerned about. Our anecdotal evidence we had was concern for some carriers to drive into a particular market and not be able to get payload out. And so, you had customers that were just trying to use capacity in any way they could. And so, maybe some heavier loads came away. Some of the stay-at-home orders were put in place, I think that we saw some of our small mom-and-pop accounts that might be closed. And so, probably more of the business that we're handling being larger national accounts, they typically have a higher weight per shipment as well. And then like I mentioned earlier, just the sheer fact that if they are essential goods, there was probably an increased demand for those. And so, there was just more widgets on every shipment that we were picking up in that regard. But, that will settled down in some regard. And in terms of how it affects overall profitability, again it's just every customer must stand on its own. That's the basis of what our pricing philosophy is. And if each customer, if we know the revenue stream both of the base rates and how we stress test the fuel surcharge, variable component of the revenue, and then we know the cost inputs then that's what we try to look at in terms of managing account-by-account profitability. That said, I mentioned that we've done a good job I think in managing our direct operating costs, and keeping those somewhat consistent as a percent of revenue despite the significant disruption that we face. So all of those cost inputs should be covered and it just becomes matter of on the big picture level what revenue in total might look like in elements of the overhead like our depreciation in particular, what type of increases we might see there. So overall it's not a bad thing to see the increase weight per shipment, usually on just a per shipment basis. It's a better thing you get a little bit more revenue per shipment when the cost to handle would be the same. But right now it's just obviously very fluid with what we're actually picking up and continuing to work through the system and the network as we speak. I think that for the most part, we try to adjust our fuel tables to be able to have the same level or similar level of profitability by account as the fuel prices are higher or lower. So obviously, we're getting lower fuel surcharges right now, but the costs are down as well. And in regards to just the operating ratio, the only thing I can say is that what we've already said we're trying to from a big picture standpoint. And one thing, we don't manage our national accounts any different from our smaller accounts, each should stand on their own from an operating ratio standpoint. So having more of one business is not necessarily a bad thing if we got that balanced out right from a pricing standpoint. But right now, if we can hold our own with managing our direct operating costs, which are typically around 58% to 60% of revenue, if we can keep those flattish, it's then just trying to minimize any increase in the overhead type of costs, any inflation that we might see in those costs items as a percent of revenue, given the overall big picture revenue weakness that we're seeing in April. The 15% of the year-over-year, so that's compared to April of last year. Really didn't have any kind of material action in the first quarter. The 5% decrease really was just a function of kind of the ending headcount that we finished in December of last year. The headcount drifted down a little bit, but we had talked on the last quarter's call about the fact that we felt like we could handle growth, and we were just letting some natural attrition continues to take place. So it drifted down a little bit, but the April number is what reflects the furloughs that were put in place. So that's down, not quite as much, obviously as the number of shipments. But certainly we want to make sure we've got people capacity in place in the event that things turn back on and we continue to see volumes come in the network. So, feel good about kind of where we are in that regard and we'll continue to move forward and just evaluate on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis kind of where we are with volumes and revenue and how we're managing our people capacity.  In regards to the benefits, we had kind of said I think coming into this year that about 34%, so about a third as you said, as a percent of salaries and wages was the target. We did a little bit better than that in the first quarter. That number in the first quarter was about 32.5%. So, it's somewhere around of a third to 32% to 34% is probably likely, maybe a little bit higher, since we are covering the healthcare cost of furloughed employees. So, that might tick up albeit at the higher end of that scale, and kind of what our target was coming into this year. We are already making cost adjustments in areas like general supplies and expenses and some of our miscellaneous expense items as well. So we're making every effort to eliminate cost where we can and where it makes sense and in terms of just overall kind of revenue levels, and I think Greg mentioned this in his prepared remarks is that, the good news is things have kind of settled in and our revenue levels have been very consistent. That certainly helps us from a planning standpoint, and makes it -- if not easy, but it makes it a little bit easier versus if the revenue on each day of the week was very inconsistent and choppy. So, we've been pleased to see that stability with the revenue and then we'll continue to see where we go from here. But, against our earlier comments, I feel like that we're getting to the point where we're well into this pandemic and now that it seems like some of it's coming under control and some markets are beginning to talk about reopening, you'd like to think that the worst is behind us and that we've hit a floor. But that's something that we look at each and every day and will continue to stay on top of and we're going to manage our costs to whatever the revenue level trends are. It's I would just say the long-term trend has certainly been that we've seen more growth in retail-related business. Not any kind of necessary change or any difference in that regard for what we saw in the first quarter. Most of those were trending, somewhat in line. And what we've seen in April, as you can imagine, we've got exposure to agricultural on food and food distributors and things like that, that have been good and any type of manufacturing that would go into those types of things or other medical-related and chemical-related type of products as well. So that's kind of been the areas that have performed and have continued to give us business, if you will, in April. While some other things that if it's -- you can just sort of think about the basics and the places that are continuing to be open for business in terms of what products might be moving or not. So -- but not any kind of wholesale change. But long-term, as we've said multiple times, we think there will continue to be more of a change with respect to retail supply chains and move towards having some type of e-commerce type of presence and how that -- or the ripple effects of that throughout the nation supply chain. And we'll be in place where much of the focus on the retailers that are making those types of changes has been on carriers that offer higher service levels. And so that's been a tailwind for our business in recent years. And the fact that our service levels helped many of our customers avoid fines and charge backs and things like that, that many retailers are putting in place. Sure. In terms of how we entered the recession in '08 and '09, it was we sort of eased into it. The fourth quarter of '08 was down about 5% or 6%, and then we kind of went down to somewhere between 15% -- 15% to 20% drop in revenue in the first quarter of '09, and then it kind of got to its worst in the second quarter. And now, obviously, we just faced a sudden drop off in April. And really, at the end of March, we didn't necessarily see a drop-off in freight levels at the end of March. It was lower than what we expected. But really, it was, we didn't get the end of quarter buildup that we typically see. And it may have been a little bit soft, but I think that many customers still had kind of orders in the chain, if you will, and we continue to make some of those deliveries. So we held somewhat steady, if you will, from the middle of March towards the end and just missed the normal kind of end of quarter buildup. But now, and kind of as we anticipated, we saw the rapid drop-off in April, and it's obviously much harder to respond to that type of change and to be able to keep the network of 238 service centers remaining fluid and our service metrics high. So I've been really impressed with the operations team and how they've made these adjustments cutting out costs, minimizing empty miles. Our dock productivity is up. P&D productivity is looking good as well and when you think about that, I mean, our miles between stops, those types of things become more challenging when you got some customers that are closed and it just makes that job function that much more difficult and lack of efficiency. But it all goes back to the fact that over the years and the experience that our team has, we've got a lot of experience, and we've got a lot of technology in place to kind of help us plan, but it's not artificial intelligence, it's human ingenuity that's been able to keep our system running in a very efficient manner and we're really pleased with how quickly the team has adapted to these abrupt changes of just revenue falling off a cliff like the half. I think that as we've seen in recent years and even going back to when we were slower in 2016, we believe that LTL would continue to be disciplined. Just this year, in fact, that it's so consolidated with 80% of the revenue being in the top 10 carriers. And then when you look at many of the carriers' margins, it's not really in a position to really go out and try to trade price for volume. In fact, it's probably better to go out and try to implement more of an increase to try to shore up their profit levels. So we felt like that LTL pricing would stay more consistent, and it's held fairly steady. We faced some spotty issues last year and dealt with those. And we'll always continue to see spotty issues, and that happens even in good times. So we believe that pricing is critically important. It's obviously been very supportive to us over the years to make sure that we're getting price increases to offset our cost inflation and to support the investments that frankly customers are demanding of us to continue to support technology investments and support capacity infrastructure as well. So we believe that we'll continue to see relative discipline out of the Group, and there's still a benefit of moving freight by LTL. We were like ridesharing before ridesharing was cool. And you're sharing every customer is sharing the cost of the freight. And it's cheaper to move shipments that are less than 10,000 pounds by riding on the truck with some other customer versus the truckload world. And even when they try to dip down and do multi-stock network is not really conducive to doing that. Their equipment is not and their drivers aren't paid to make multiple stops like ours are. So I think the industry remains strong, and we'll continue to be disciplined with respect to price, relatively speaking. Sure. The April -- on a shipments per day basis, April shipments are typically a 0.9% higher than March, and May is 3.2% higher than April, and June is 1.8% higher than May. Well, obviously, if things are down about 20%, I hadn't really calculated necessarily for how it looks into a sequential, but that would put us down about somewhere in the neighborhood of 15% or so versus shipment levels for March. Not on the wage side, we did talk about the fact that they will we are covering the cost of the benefits those so the fringe benefit will likely be a little bit higher right at the higher end of our normal range, if you will, as a percent of salaries and wages. Obviously, load factor is something that we manage and watch on a daily basis. Unfortunately, so far, month to day, the load factors have actually improved some. You've got to keep in mind that we have multiple schedules in all of our lanes. And in a lot of cases, you just end up reducing those schedules in cases where we're down. But we do manage that very closely. And again, fortunately, month-to-date, our load factors have shown some improvement. Yes. I talked around that earlier in the call. So I'll point you back to the transcript or either we can follow-up later. Well, over time, the operating ratio level that we've improved, most of the improvement has come in those direct operating costs, which most of which are variable. So we've got an improvement over the years, and our overhead costs have stayed relatively consistent as a percent of revenue. But we've always, in our history, tried to work on operating efficiencies, and we have a continuous improvement process that focuses on quality and we've always made efforts through technology improvements and just general process improvement to try to optimize mainly labor cost as a percent of revenue. And so that's just that's been a focus. It will continue to be a focus. And we feel like that's an area where you've got the ongoing opportunity for operating ratio improvement. But it takes the ingredients for long-term operating ratio improvement are density, which obviously we don't have right now. And then a yield improvement process that tries to cover our cost inflation. And so over time, we've been able to leverage the additional density through the network. That too drives operating efficiencies and OR improvement. And then just having that yield contribution there. Both of those require the macroeconomic support, though. But that, it's definitely improved. Our direct operating costs have been the biggest area of improvement over the long run. Of variable costs? I don't know that it's risen. It's certainly an area where we've been able to get improvement, though, in those costs as a percent of revenue."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion finished 2021 with outstanding fourth quarter financial performance that resulted in new company records for annual revenues and profitability. The fourth quarter of 2021 was our fourth straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth, and the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2022. We can do this by continuing to execute on the same strategic plan that has driven our history of long-term profitable growth. This strategy is centered on our ability to deliver a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers. The OD family of employees worked through every challenge thrown its way in 2021 and continued to deliver best-in-class service, while skillfully managing the 19.4% growth in our LTL shipments per day for the full year. I can assure you that delivering on time, without damage is a significant accomplishment with this type of volume growth. That is why I'm so proud that in 2021, we once again earned the Mastio Quality Award, which recognizes us as the national number one LTL carrier for the 12th straight year. Providing superior service not only allows us to win market share, it also supports our long term pricing strategy. We have consistently focused on improving our yields at the individual account level to both offset our cost inflation and support further investment in our business. This approach has helped strengthen our financial position over time, and allow us to do something that others in our industry have not consistently invest in new capacity. We have historically invested 10% to 15% of our revenue and capital expenditures each year, and we expect to spend approximately $825 million this year. We believe consistent and long term investments in capacity are valued by customers as an integral component of quality service. And these investments are also necessary to support our on-going market share initiatives. We simply never want our service center network to be a limiting factor to growth, which is why we have spent over $1.8 billion over the past 10 years to expand our service center capacity across the nation. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% of spare capacity in our network. Although our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes another $300 million to further expand our service center capacity to stay ahead of our anticipated growth curve. There are of course, two other ingredients in the capacity equation, our fleet and our people. We intend to spend 485 million for new tractors and trailers this year. We would frankly like to spend more but we have been limited by several suppliers that are facing manufacturing challenges. We are fortunate we're fortunate to enter the pandemic with one of the youngest fleets in our industry. And as a result, we can continue to use existing equipment that otherwise would have been replaced this year. This strategy may continue to cost us a little more in maintenance and repair costs as it did in 2021. But we believe our current fleet and these additions will be sufficient to accommodate our expected growth. As we have done in recent quarters, we also expect to continue to utilize purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our equipment. The final ingredient and the most important piece of our strategic plan is the investment that we continuously make in our people. The OD family of employees grew by 20% in 2021, which including added adding over 1700 drivers and a challenging labor market. We expect that 2022 will be another big recruiting year for OD. While the labor market remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to add to our team due to our outstanding company culture. In addition, we offer a rewarding pay and benefits package and certainly expect to make company record discretionary contribution to our employees\u2019 401K retirement plan. Our long term strategic plan is straightforward, difficult for others to successfully replicate and builds on itself year-after-year. Our success over the years has proven the flywheel effect of our strategic plan and we believe it will spin even faster in 2022. We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and we are confident that the disciplined execution of this strategic plan will produce further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion\u2019s revenue grew 31.4% to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our operating ratio improved 270 basis points to 73.6%. The combination of these changes resulted in a 49.7% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.41 for the quarter. Our revenue growth included a nice balance of increases in both volume and yield, which are both supported by a favorable domestic economy. We believe we are currently winning a significant amount of market share based on a comparison of our shipment trends with publicly disclosed information for other LTL carriers. Our LTL funds per day increased 14.3% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 16.1% Our LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 9.2% due primarily to the success of our long term pricing strategy, as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter LTL shipments per day increased 0.1% over the third quarter of 2021, which compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential decrease of 3.5%. LTL funds per day increased 2.4% as compared to a 10-year average sequential decrease of 1.7%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. For January, our revenue per day increased 25.7% as compared to January of 2021. This growth included a 7.7% increase in LTL funds per day, and a 16.8% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 73.6% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, productive labor as a percentage of revenue improved 320 basis points, which more than offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in our operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel. We continue to use purchase transportation during the quarter to supplement the capacity of our workforce and our fleet. And we expect to use a similar amount of these third party services in the first quarter. We were very proud that our annual operating ratio of 73.5% surpassed our previous internal goal of 75%. As we execute on a long term continuous improvement cycle for our operating ratio, we intend to follow the same successful approach that we have in the past, which is to focus on density and yield. The spare capacity within our ever growing network allows us to drive additional volumes through our system, which generally create strong incremental margins at the local service center level. We're confident in our ability to further improve our operating ratio and it dropped our internal goal another 500 basis points. As a result, we will now be focused on achieving an annual operating ratio in the 60s [ph]. Old Dominion\u2019s cash flow from operations total $340 million and $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, and 2021 respectively. All capital expenditures were $165.4 million and $550.1 million for the same period. Greg mentioned earlier that we currently expect capital expenditures in 2022 have approximately $825 million. This total includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. Although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long term strategic plan. We would also increase our expenditures for new equipment if availability improves during the year. We paid $23 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. While we did not utilize cash for share repurchases, our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program remained active during the fourth quarter. We utilized $691.4 million of cash for our shareholder return programs during 2021. And that consisted of $599 million for share repurchases and $92.4 million for cash dividends. We were pleased that our board of directors approved a 50% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 25% as compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently expect an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Jack Atkins from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay, Greg. Good morning, guys. And thanks for the longer term color on the new operating ratio target. That's exciting. So I guess for my first question, if we can maybe kind of shorter term kind of focus on what you saw in January, Adam, thanks for the for the trends from a tonnage perspective and your perspective. But anything that you could maybe add was whether the first couple of weeks in the month a little bit of a challenge. We've heard that the rise in COVID cases in December and January, presented some challenges for carriers just sort of curious if you could maybe comment on what you saw there sort of within the month, and I'll follow up after that.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. And good morning, Jack. There were several things impacting January and certainly every January we deal with whether it's not a onetime event, and it's included in all of our 10-year average trends that we typically compared to similar to the effect of COVID in certain months of last year, when you only look on a one month period. We did have some effect. We felt like both directly and indirectly with customers that were impacted through labor shortages and so forth. And so we saw a little bit of that impact as well during the month and we came off an incredibly strong December. So to talk about December first a little bit just on a weight per day basis. December's tons per day was down 1.1% our 10-year average is a decrease of 9.1%. So from a sequential standpoint, we felt like, we were going to see that that build up in December coming off November that had a little bit of some of the same effects that we talked about earlier. So we expected that, but the timing of Urient [ph] also had a little bit of effect of both helping December, and then starting out that first day of January, being a lot softer. We don't typically get into these half day conventions and so forth, like some others do. But I would just say that first day of the month was certainly not a full normal day, like what we saw for the remainder of the month. So with all that said, we still grew revenue, that 25%. We're really pleased to see that we saw a continuation of the strong yield trends continue in solid volume performance, given all the factors that we just discussed.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's, that's, that's great to hear. And thank you for that. I guess, maybe a longer term question. I don't Adam, I don't know if you are going to take it or Greg wants to take it. But, I would just be curious to get your sense for the trajectory of the growth rate for the LTL market more broadly, not just in 2022 but over the next several years. I think there's a sense that some folks have a concern maybe that some folks have that LTL have benefited from all the supply chain disruption, maybe more so than others. But there seems to be increased shipper demand for LTL capacity, because of e-commerce and a number of other factors. You guys are investing for growth, I would just be curious if you could maybe walk us through sort of your maybe your longer term perspective for the LTL market, not just in 22, but over the next several years.\nGreg Gantt: Jack, I'll take a shot at that. And I\u2019ll let Adam add to this, but you're right. From what we have seen and from talking with our customers, we expect continued growth. It looks like if anything to see e-commerce is continuing to drive the LTL market. And the industrial economy has been strong. And everything that we see on the horizon is, is we expect continued growth. I want to roll back to the COVID question that you asked prior. Just for everyone's information and I'm sure somebody else intends to ask this. But we have seen our numbers go in the right direction over the last several weeks. And I think it's important to note, I think we've heard the same thing, all the news is as to what's happening around the country, but our trend has been really positive the last few weeks and our cases are really down. And it looks like from our perspective, this thing could be dying out. So hopefully, that's happening everywhere. And I think if it is that'll sure be a boost to everything related to the economy and certainly to conducting business more as normal and a long time since normal. But hopefully we can get back to that. And I'll let Adam add to that longer term growth question.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes Jack, I would just repeat what Greg said and certainly feel like there continue to be tailwinds to the industry. And we feel like the industry has already been growing above GDP and believe really, that that the industry as a whole could have grown more. But we \u2013 the industry continues to be capacity constrained and that's why we talk about the service advantages that we have in the marketplace, as well as the capacity advantages that have driven much of our growth. And we probably could have grown even faster this year. But it's something that we've certainly taken advantage of all the investments that we've made over time. We've invested a lot in our network, over $1.8 billion, the last 10-years growing our door count over 50%, while our shipment count has grown over the last 10 years about 70% or so. When you look at the other group of public carriers, there's been a decrease in the number of service centers in the industry. So and then for that reason, the other carriers that total shipments managed by the group is pretty flat as well. So we'll see how that continues to trend but there's service value that we add. And I think our customers are starting to appreciate that more when they look through their supply chain in total in leveraging an LTL carriers network. That\u2019s why it's so important that we continue with our yield improvement initiatives to continue to have the financial strength to invest further in our system to allow us to continue to grow with our customers because that's a big piece of the overall quality equation and that serve as well that we deliver they can call on us and they certainly are doing so when you look at our volume performance this year, customers are increasingly calling on us to deliver for them because of capacity shortfalls that they're experiencing through either other carriers or other modes.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks again for the time.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Jason Seidl from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Greg, Adam and team, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to focus a little bit on the yield side. First, the numbers you gave imply, probably the largest sequential 1Q increase, you've seen in a little bit of time. I wondered if you could talk about contractual rate renewals and how they trended in 4Q and how they're looking early on. And then I want to chat a little bit about your length of haul. Growing again, 4Q is that the type of business that you're winning out there in the marketplace? Or is there something structurally going on in the marketplace to lengthen that LOH [ph] that you are seeing?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think that, on the length of haul, just to address that piece, your question first. Yes, it was a little bit longer. We were at 944 miles in the fourth quarter, but we've been around 935 miles to 945 miles. When you look longer term, we've seen length of hauls decrease, we've certainly seen this regionalization of kind of going back to the longer term question, we believe is regionalization of the industry will continue and we're seeing good growth and our next day and second day lanes. But the last couple of years, there's been pockets of growth in different places. We've had tremendous growth off the west coast, which typically has a little bit longer length of haul with it. So there's just been some different growth and in different areas with certain customers that it's moved it up a little bit, but it's pretty much staying within a fairly consistent band and, and I wasn't really expecting material change from where we are other than eventually getting back to the scene decreasing a little bit. And with regards to the yield performance, for us, we have a long term consistent strategy that that focus was all in trying to achieve yield improvement to offset our cost inflation each year. And, and we need cost plus, because again, it gets back to supporting the investments that customers are demanding from us in additional real estate capacity, as well as into our technologies as well, from a revenue per shipment standpoint, just getting away from the per 100. Because certainly, some of those metrics that change in weight per shipment, the change in the length of haul both had the effect of increasing the revenue per hundredweight, but our revenue per shipment, excluding the fuel was up 6%. And that was a good performance. But overall, we had to see some higher renewals kind of in the back half of the year, our cost inflation on a per shipment basis. And the back half of the year was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated the average cost per shipment for the full year would be and we'll see that trend a little bit higher in the first half of next year and then kind of normalized, but certainly we're continuing to get increases to offset that cost inflation. So those renewals in the back half of this year, has probably been a little bit higher than those in the first half of 2021 that is. And so, it's always just a continuous improvement cycle that we have. We look at each account on its own operating merits the freight that we get and ways that we can improve yield. And that's not always through price, either. So, I think we've been successful. Certainly when you look at that revenue per shipment, cost per shipment, delta in the fourth quarter, and really for the full year as well, just reinforces that that long term consistent approach that we've strived for.\nJason Seidl: Appreciate the color thanks for the time again.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Adam, can you share that the yield, the yield trends ex-fuel in January and then any thoughts on just that 1Q or seasonality and how you're thinking about that?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. So the per hundredweight with the fuel, as we said earlier was between 16.5% at 16.8% without fuels right at 11%. So we're still seeing increasing rates really on the average price per gallon. And as that increase through the year, it's the average in January was up about 39% versus January of last year just for the national average there. So that fuel price component is certainly picking up and going into both the that revenue component, but also getting into the cost as well. And certainly, there's more than just the direct cost of diesel fuel that we use in our operations. As fuel prices go higher, that certainly works its way into tires and other components we have to deal with. So anything that's sort of fuel related, we'll see that same type of inflation or, with that said, and in regards to our costs, typically the fourth quarter, the first quarter sequential is about 100 basis point deterioration. Now one thing to say before I get into, a little bit more detail about that is typically that includes kind of a flattish, when you look at the insurance and claims line, kind of flat performance from 4Q to 1Q. We had a benefit in the fourth quarter, as you could see on that insurance and claims line. And that mainly comes from the actuarial assessment that we do each year, that was only seven tenths of a percent, where we averaged 1.1% to 1.2%, in the first three quarters of 2021. We expect that number to go back up to about 1.2% in the first quarter, give or take. So we've got a little natural drag, if you will, versus our normal sequential performance, if you will. With that said, however, we're still targeting about 100 basis points of change there and plus or minus, certainly, that's just one specific number. But I think that given the strong revenue performance, I think that we can offset much of that. So maybe 80 basis points to 120 basis points is to give us a little range, there will be what we're trying to target achieving in 1Q. And certainly the one key performance, when you look at the average, a lot goes into that the revenue effect like we mentioned earlier can be a little different from one period to the next. And certainly there's the calls that come in, that's not as consistent performance from 4Q to 1Q, like there is and maybe some of the other quarters, just given the natural disruption that happens in those periods. But that natural disruption goes into that 10-year average.\nScott Group: Very helpful. And then just last one, if I look over the last five years, your operating ratios improved about 200 basis points a year on average. Do you think that's a realistic way to think about either 2022, or the next several years. I'm just trying to think about when realistically you can get to that sub 70 alarm?\nAdam Satterfield: And we didn't put a timeline per se on it, because really we're looking for, for profitable growth each year. And some years we get a little bit more revenue contribution. Some years, we get a little bit more margin contribution; they all go into that profitable growth line. And we pretty much played 2021 like a piano [ph] and got a little bit of both revenue and margin. So we were pleased to see that and followed a very successful 2020. So the five year of 200 bips is probably a little bit stronger, given the performance in 2018 as well. When you look over a longer term, it's been more in the 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And we talked about 10 years sequential from quarter-to-quarter. And that's probably been more in that long term. But right now, demand continues to be incredibly strong. So we certainly are expecting another very solid revenue performance here this year. And we're going to be investing dollars, investing significantly for headcount growth, as Greg mentioned. So we can continue to give the same service that our customers expect, and we're going to be adding to our fleet and into our network. So there's a lot of investment that goes into the continuing to take advantage of the market share opportunities that we feel are out there. So it's not, we're not going to give a specific goal for what we think we can do in 2022, but, but certainly the focus will be to produce as much profitable growth as we can.\nScott Group: Appreciate the time guys, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: [Technical Difficulty] FTL, you do start to say some pretty tough comparables as you get into second quarter, particularly around volumes, so industrial production growth 3.5%, 4% this year? I mean, how do you think about high level sort of ability to grow tonnage, I assume on a full year basis. But looking past the first quarter, the second, how you may be thinking about those more challenging comps? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Jordan, you broke up a little bit. So I don't know if I missed anything at the start. But just in regards to the volume environment. Again, it just gets back to the underlying strength of demand. And certainly, that's all the customer feedback that we've been hearing, coupled with capacity issues and other places of our customers supply chains. When we look at the economic trends, we feel like that, we would expect continued strength with our industrial related customers, as well as the on-going strength with our retail related customers as well. So, we're, we're used to tough comps, if you will. Given our long term revenue performance over the last 10 years, that's pretty much we've produced about 11% average growth in revenues. And even though we'll follow up, what would have been a record growth year of $1.2 billion of new revenue produced last year, we certainly have got big expectations for 2022 just given all those factors. So we'll see how the, the comparisons work out. And I think that if you just assumed normal sequential trends, that would still put us at kind of the high, single digit, low double digit type range.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you about, I guess, price. And I don't know if you want to refer to like contract renewals. But I think you've saw some acceleration in price through the year in 2021. Maybe you see that stay elevated in first half and kind of ease in second half, but wanted to see if you could offer some kind of high level thoughts on where maybe where contract renewals were in fourth quarter? And what you think the profile looks like on price in 2022? And then I had a follow up on [Indiscernible] question.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, Tom, we've kind of just stopped talking about contractual renewals, because I've somewhat feel like, that's, that's obviously a very big piece of the overall revenue equation, about 25% of our business is on our tariffs business, and certainly the majority being on contract. But it seems like it's a talking point from the others in the industry, that doesn't always reconcile with necessarily what you see out of the yield performance. But, it all just sort of goes into it, whether it's price increases, other operational changes, that drive yields, and so forth, and the things that we look for, we'll say that, like I mentioned earlier. We expect our, we saw higher cost per shipment in the back half of last year. We expect our cost per shipment this year, to probably be on a net basis, maybe in the 4.5% to 5% range. And that's excluding the effects of fuel but, but it's going to be weighted heavier, we're going to see higher costs per shipment inflation in the first half of the year, and then think that some of those expenses normalized, when we get into the back half and start laughing over where we've recently been seeing inflation in our business. So with that said, certainly the contracts that mature in the first half of the year, they didn't have as much of an increase last year, so they will probably get a little bit more and then those in the back half that maybe got a little bit higher increase reflecting what the actual cost trends were, in the back half of 2021 may not see as much. But overall, the focus continues. We\u2019ve got to look at how our cost inflation is trending, and then trying to target 150 basis points above that. We did the January numbers, I did mention this earlier, but we did take our general rate increase, which is on our tariffs business that was affected the beginning of January. So that was a part of that yield performance that we've already seen to start off the year.\nTom Wadewitz: So you think you moved back in second half of the year towards kind of more normal, annual LTL pricing called mid-single digits is that is that a reasonable expectation, if you look towards kind of second half of the year?\nAdam Satterfield: Again, I think that, we've got to look at how our cost inflation at that time is trending. And, if we're seeing some normalization at that point, then then the expectation comes back. But at the end of the day, we've got to look at each customer's account, the revenue inputs and the cost inputs, and in terms of what we're actually seeing, and how the account is operating, and look at ways to drive improvement in that customers operating ratio. If we can do that by price, that's one way to look at it. There may be other operational changes, new pieces of business, that we may get different factors that that can overall drive an improvement. For us, we're looking at driving a continuous improvement cycle and each customer account and that customer account builds up to each individual service center and those builds to the company. So certainly, we're looking to improve the operating ratio, and that's how you got to go about tackling it.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, that makes sense. If I can ask one more, I guess for Greg, how do you think about the cycle and with respect to. It seems like historically, you probably have some give back in a cycle where you've had strengths in LTL. And aside truckload market, and truckload loosens, that there might be some impact in the cycle historically. Do you think that it\u2019s reasonable to expect that this time? I mean, it does seem like LTL has been the one mode that could add capacity. And it would be natural to think some LTL freight in the market, maybe not for OD but in the market goes back to truckload later this year or next year? You think that's right, or is that? Is it going to be different maybe this time?\nGreg Gantt: Tom, I can tell you, we don't have any volumes at this point in time to go back to truckload. I think if you look at what we've done and what we've been able to take out over the course of time due to capacity restraints, and whatnot. Most of those type volumes are out of our network at this point. So I don't -- I think the environment for us from that standpoint is extremely positive, as far as we can see through 2022. Certainly things change as you go through the year. But right now, I don't see any volume going over the truckload at all. Not from our standpoint. And, as Adam has mentioned numerous times, we're continuing to add capacity. I would expect that we'll be on a strong trajectory all year along.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Okay, thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, Greg. Hi, Adam. Adam, I just wanted to clarify one question. I guess from Jordan earlier, you talked about high single-digit low double-digits. Maybe I didn't catch it. Was that first quarter full year was it tonnage with a shipment? What were you exactly referring to on higher to single digit, low double digits?\nAdam Satterfield: I wasn't given any specific guidance there. I was just basically saying that if you assumed normal sequential trends, in our tons that that what about the, if you just roll them out quarter by quarter, what the year might look like? But certainly, at this point we feel like just like what we saw last year that the demand is so strong out there. And we'll see how the year progresses. When in the past, we've typically had, probably about six quarters or so when you look through past growth cycles. We typically have had six or so quarters where we significantly exceed our 10-year trends. And then it kind of reverts back to the average and the average sequential performance for us includes a lot of market share wins. Going back to my previous comment, we've grown our shipments over the past 10-years around 70%. So those 10-year trends include a lot of market share, and we certainly think that given the comparison of our volumes that we've seen to the industry for the third quarter, that's kind of the way things have trended. We have this spare capacity that it's out there that we try to invest ahead of the curve, so that the network is not a limiting factor and we can help our customers grow when we get in these strong demand periods. So we'll see how the quarter-by-quarter is trending as we work our way through 2022. But the one thing we will say is that the underlying demand has not changed. It was consistently strong through 2021. And the customer conversations that we have today indicates that that strength is going to continue for the foreseeable future.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, so that was just more tonnage commentary, by extrapolating current trends and kind of where the year shakes out. So, okay, so I get that. The other question I have is incremental door capacity in 2022. Obviously, all this new capacity that you're putting online, doesn't come on January 1. And so any help around what the kind of incremental door capacity is from these investments, per rata for when they actually come online in 2022, and even 2023, if you could talk about that?\nAdam Satterfield: We -- I think we've said before that we intend to add somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 service centers this coming year. We don't necessarily always share the door detail, for example, but when we look, we don't give it year-by-year more for strategic reasons. But if you look over the last 10 years, we've expanded the door count by about 50% in total. So as Greg mentioned before, we've got about 15% to 20% spare capacity in the network. We were fortunate that we started out 21 in a really good spot. So despite the 19.4% growth that we had in shipments during the year, we were still able to keep fair measure of spare capacity out there. So we'll continue to build on that level. We've got a few other things that will happen earlier in the year. Those were projects that already had been in the works, and some that we thought we might have been able to finish by the end of the year, but so we'll get some new capacity out there on the service center side pretty early. And we'll be adding to it pretty, pretty consistently throughout the year.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay I wanted to come back, I think to Scott's question on long term margin improvement. I want to kind of approach it a little bit different way if I could. I mean, Adam, you've talked about direct and indirect costs as a way to kind of articulate the inherent operating leverage in the business. I think it was like 25%. Previously, you've obviously made the cost structure looks different now, given the progress that you've made in the pricing initiatives to shouldn't agree. But wondering, it seems like the new baseline operating leverage is kind of 30% plus, versus that 25%? I don't know if you agree with that, or if that's the right baseline to use, that can maybe help in for our pace of margin improvement going forward?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure, yes. We we've talked about the cost structure in previous quarters. And effectively, our total direct costs, for last year, about 55% of revenue in our overhead was around 19% of revenue. And so some of that overhead, maybe 5% is also variable in nature. So when you look at the total variable costs, and that structure, that revenue growth can give us the incremental margins in the 35% to 40% range, in a short period of time. And certainly we did, I think, 39% for all of last year, so really strong operating leverage year for us. But our story, like I said, it's not just all margin improvement. We want to continue to build up the network to take advantage of the market share opportunities, which we feel are out there, and we want to keep growing the top line which takes investment. And so we know that we need to continue to invest, to keep taking advantage of that revenue growth opportunity and so that, that may call some quarters that the incremental margin might not be in that that 35% to 40% range, and that's okay. That's why we don't manage the business to an incremental margin per se. We're going to do the right things, right, that we feel like build out the network to allow us to keep achieving the top line growth and then have the ultimate effect of also driving long term margin improvement for us.\nAmit Mehrotra: Make sense. Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, I'm just going to combine a couple into one because they're kind of all related. Adam, trying to talk about market share in this column and in the press release. Is there any way to quantify how your market share, how much you've taken effectively from the LTL Pie over the last call it five years? And as you look at your service center growth for this year, and I'm sure you're not completely in tune with what everyone's doing. But you probably have a pretty good sense for the market. How much do you think that your setup to take this year? And then the second part of it is, as you think about these market share gains that you've won, especially in the last 12 months, have these been kind of just traditional contract duration, traditional customers, or given the tightness of capacity across the entire logistics here? Are you winning kind of longer term contracts, new types of customers, as you\u2019ve taken share recently?\nGreg Gantt: I think our biggest wins have come from our ability to service the customers as they see the need. I mean, a lot of our competitors just haven't been able to provide the capacity that we have. And that's what that's my opinion as to why we've taken the share that we have. Just to get back to that share growth over the last five years. And Adam, you may need to help me here. But I was pretty say it's pretty fair to say we've been growing about that share about 1% a year. It's kind of a creep, if you will, it's not really a, a leap by any stretch. But, but it is has been very consistent. And we continue to see that as we get. As far as the service center network and whatnot, Adam mentioned, we're looking at 8 to 10. This year, we've got quite a few in the process. Now the good thing is some of those are, are fairly large, there's a couple big ones in my area that will give us quite a few additional doors. So I think we're going to be in a good spot. We, as I've mentioned, in over the last several years on all of our calls, I think we talked about the places where we're challenged, and we still got places that are challenged to expand and whatnot. But we do have some good ones working and I think we're going to be better off as the year progresses. We'll see how the growth trends and whatnot. But I think we're in a really good spot. And I would expect that that work is going to pay off for us.\nJon Chappell: Great. Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit. Headcount has been growing faster than shipment count for the past couple of quarters. And I understand there's probably some catch up there. What's your expectation for headcount growth into 2022? And also relative to shipment count. And then just any general comments on labor availability? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Yes Todd. Certainly, we're trying to add labor as we speak there. It has been a challenge, as I mentioned before, but we have been able to successfully add folks and right now we have needs, certainly as we get into the stronger parts of summer season, later in the spring, and certainly through the summer, in the fall, we need to continue to add folks without a doubt. So I would expect that those trends would pretty much mirror our shipment growth, and [Indiscernible] is growth. So I don't expect that to be a whole lot different. But yes, we need to add and those efforts are certainly underway if it\u2019s fallen.\nTodd Fowler: Greg or Adam, could you I mean, you care to kind of put like a finer point, I mean, should the spread between headcount growth and shipment count, start to narrow, or do you expect us to continue to try and add in front of the shipment growth for the next, kind of foreseeable future?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think that, we finally just sort of caught back up with it at the tail end of 2021. Then, we'd expect to see, probably the headcount a little bit stronger than the shipment count. Certainly probably for the first half of this year. But when you look over the longer term, those two numbers kind of work in concert with one another. They're pretty matched evenly. And I think that really the top line is what dictates it, Todd, and certainly last year, really going back to 2020. Once the recovery began which for us was in May we were pretty much playing catch up. We\u2019ve had this tremendous volume performance. Really, unlike anything we've ever seen that with the fourth quarter being higher than the third, I mean, just really tremendous recovery since that drop in April of 2020. So we've continued to add people really at levels above what the normal sequential trends in headcount would be. I think that will continue in the first quarter until we get back to the levels where we can support the freight that we're seeing. But we've got to match it to with the, the equipment base that we have. And so it's just something that we've got to manage through as we work our way through the year. But as long as we keep seeing that, that top line, performance and strength coming at us, we're going to continue to try to hire and have the right people in the right place that is efficiently operating, keeping our service metrics best-in-class and taking care of our customer and the lever that will continue to pull. And we think that we'll have to keep using this and 2022 will be the purchase transportation, and we've had to utilize that. I think probably every quarter as we worked our way through last year, we talked about trying to get away from it. And ultimately, we do, we want that number to revert back to that old 2 to 2.5% that was there for our Canadian operation in a truckload brokerage business, where we've got 100% of our line haul network in source and we're using our people and our equipment to service our freight. But until then we've got some good partners and they're continuing to deliver within our service expectations and keep our service metrics best-in-class and, and really just helping us to be able to grow the top line. So we'll continue to pull that lever while we have to.\nTodd Fowler: Well, Adam, my follow up was on purchase transportation and kind of the expectations in the service. So you covered that one for me. I'll pass it along. Thanks for the time.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Todd.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. On the real estate expansion as some of your peers become more eager to invest in growth, like you've been doing for quite a time here. Are you starting to see more competition at the locations that you'd like to expand in? Or is it really just you versus broader industrial real estate?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, it's certainly the latter Bascome. This just, I don't know that it's the competition for real estate. Generally speaking, it\u2019s just being able to find real estate that we need and being able to get it sold and, and get the building done. Sometimes you can find the land and you know it\u2019s the hoops, you've got to jump through to get it zoned and, and meet all the building requirements and all those different things. But trust me, there's a lot of challenges out there. From a real estate standpoint, it's not easy. As we've grown, and as we require bigger and bigger facilities to meet our needs and to plan for years down the road. It's just gotten more and more difficult. But certainly there is some competition in certain locations. And I've talked about that numerous times before. But the competition in certain markets is definitely tougher than others. Some places it\u2019s still relatively easy, we can fund and meet our needs. But there are some that again, are rather challenging, if you will.\nBascome Majors: And to that point, you mentioned a couple of locations would be particularly large ads this year. You talk about the geography or timing of those.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. One of those is in the Northeast that we've owned for several years now. It's been it was occupied with \u2013 tied up for the lease. We should get that late this year sometime. It's up in northern Pennsylvania. We own it today. But it's not available for the time being but we will get it to think about it. You probably have a little work to do to get it up and running. But that should come on late this year. We've got another fairly large facility in Southern Minneapolis, the southern part of Minneapolis to help us better serve that area. We're up on the north side now and certainly with the growth that we've had in that market, we need to have another facility in the South. It's getting closer like we're just a couple months away from opening that. We're working on a big one that's well underway in Kansas City that'll give us another additional fair amount of doors. So we had a lot of irons in the fire around the country and a lot of good things working. Again, I think we're pretty well positioned from that standpoint. Got a few others that I'll probably rather not talk about at this point, but a lot, a lot of work going on in the real estate department, that's for sure.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, Greg. Good morning, Greg and Adam. Thanks for getting me in here. Just to real quick, Adam, to clarify the -- your target. You said moving from 75 to 500 basis point improvement to 70. And then you talked about sub 70? Can you just kind of clarify what the target is an outlook there?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure it's, I mean 70 is the target that we want to see something start with a six. So it will be 69, or whatever we get to when we crossed that, that line, we obviously blew through the 75, this year, pretty strong and have got a good, good jump on making our way towards that 70 goal. But nevertheless, that's the goal, if you will, at a raw 70. But seeing and know I\u2019ll start with the six.\nKen Hoexter: And I think it's still fairly balanced between pricing costs, just as you've been doing. But you mentioned in the opening comments, some maybe seeing some scale of maintenance cost increases, as you kind of extend the life of the fleet. Can you talk about the impact of that we should see in the near term or this year?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean, there's some trade off there. And when you look at the depreciation expense for example, we're seeing some improvement there, that was at 4.7% of revenue. And that typically runs quite a bit higher. So we're seeing some increased maintenance costs, if you will to maintain our fleet, our average fleet ages up to five years. Now, for our power equipment, it's been as low as three and a half years, when you look over the last five, seven years or so. And so it's certainly a bit higher than then what we would like to see. And, but there's, there's also a little bit of a drag, just in total operating supplies and expenses on the fuel element, the older equipment is not as fuel efficient as the newer equipment. So, that's just something that we've got to keep balance. We'll probably see once we can start replenishing the fleet at the levels that we would like to, we'll see some incremental depreciation costs that will come online that will somewhat offset, the cost that we're seeing in operating supplies and expenses, but it will offset some of the purchase transportation costs that we're seeing. And certainly, I'm sure you're familiar with the, the truck load right environment is pretty strong right now. So those loads that we are moving with third parties, we're paying a pretty fair price for.\nKen Hoexter: Lastly, for me, just Adam, I know, you said that the piers hadn't been growing kind of looking back. But I guess somewhat backward, as we've heard a lot from the carriers, they're starting to talk about growing real estate, even our best XPO [Ph] talking door and service center ads that we hadn't heard in a while. Does that give you or Greg, any thoughts on potential pricing pressure that we haven't seen in the past?\nGreg Gantt: I wouldn't, I don't think so. I think we just got to keep doing our thing and providing value to our customers. And I don't I don't see that as a negative certainly.\nAdam Satterfield: Generally speaking, I think that can't speak for everyone. And we don't really know other than what we hear from customers. But we anticipated that we would see capacity issues with the industry this year, just based on some internal computations that we go through. And we started hearing that before we got to mid-year before the real rush began. And so I think that there's probably some needs out there. Like I mentioned, we still feel like the industry is growing. And when you look over the last 10 years, there's been a couple of other carriers that have also increased their market share. I think that the industry revenue is continuing to consolidate with the larger national non-union providers, and we think that that trend will continue in the future. But certainly, we've got service advantages as well. And it all comes back to the service value you deliver for your customer and we think we've got an unmatched value proposition that wins market share for us and we're going to continue to execute and keep giving the very best service to our customers. And we think that that will drive the market share and feel in the real estate capacity that that we continue to expect to add.\nKen Hoexter: Great stuff. Appreciate the time and thoughts. Thanks Greg. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a follow up on that last point about the market and competitive dynamics. I guess, I'm just trying to make sure I understand how you guys might respond to the extent that there is maybe a larger push by some of your competitors into the market. You guys have always been extraordinarily disciplined with the way you approach the market. So I'm guessing in a scenario where maybe some of your competitors get a bit more aggressive to expand. And obviously, there's a lot of demand out there. So I don't know that necessarily has an impact on the pricing dynamic. But I guess, I think I know the answer has been kind of curious your take on how you would adapt to a market which might actually see more, sort of push for market share from some of your competitors than we've historically seen over the last several years?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think what we'd expect, Chris is that the, the industry has been very priced disciplined, really going back to the last slowdown in 2016. And so I think that we've seen some margin improvement by some of those other carriers. If they don't have capacity, maybe they'll continue to follow our lead in terms of continuing to consistently try to increase price. When you look at the current environment, much of the revenue growth is coming by yield from other carriers. I get back to the third quarter performance. We grew our shipments 19% on average, the public carrier group was up 1%. So that wide delta in volume growth, we want to have that volume contribution, and we've got the capacity to grow both volumes and yields, whereas we've seen in prior growth periods, like 2017, 2018, what we've seen this year, or 2021 rather, the other carriers that don't have barely any capacity to grow throughout their entire system, just take advantage of the strong demand and increase yields which if they're increasing faster us because again, our pricing approaches one that's long term and consistent customers know what to expect. If other carriers are increasing their rates faster than us and closing some of that price gap, that service value looks better and better. And so, I think that's what we've seen in the past. It's what we would continue to expect to see to see that wide outperformance if you will against the other public area group data that we see on average.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: And the next question is from Bruce Chan from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hey, good morning, gentlemen thanks for squeezing me in here. I know you mentioned that there's no truckload freight to give back the cycle. And that's good to hear. But as we think about some of your comments earlier Adam around regionalization and secular growth in e-commerce, how are you thinking about your freight mix characteristics? And do you think he can kind of keep those as they are? Or do you think there may be some pressures on, length of haul and shipment density as you start to grow your share and expand your network over time?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I mean, it's certainly, we constantly communicate with, with our customers, and including third party logistics companies to try to navigate through and foresee the types of changes that are coming down the line. That goes into some of our thinking in terms of how we expand our service center network as well, and, and where we're building facility. So we certainly foresee some of those, those changes that have been happening over the last 5 years, 10 years continue. I think they've all been favorable transfer of the LTL industry, and I think we're certainly maybe benefiting more than anyone. And the reason for that and some of how we think some of this market share growth we've seen recently will be very sticky is that there's a increased premium that's being placed on service quality. And when you think about especially as low as inventory balances are right now, shippers have got to get their product on the shelves. And so they're increasingly relying on a carrier that can give 99% on time service performance and not have damages. And if you're delivering into one of the big retailers that have these chargeback programs in place then it puts an even more importance if you will on that, that service value. So that's how we're winning share in that that retail segment of the market. Certainly we've still got our healthy mix of industrial freight and think that that will continue to grow as well. But we're really winning across all segments, if you will, with direct industrial and retail related customers and seeing tremendous growth with our third party logistics customers as well. So, but we think that those trends are going to continue and the importance on total service value will continue to rise.\nOperator: Thank you, Bruce. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg cans for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion finished 2021 with outstanding fourth quarter financial performance that resulted in new company records for annual revenues and profitability. The fourth quarter of 2021 was our fourth straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth, and the sixth straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. We are encouraged by the momentum in our business and believe that we are uniquely positioned to win additional market share in 2022. We can do this by continuing to execute on the same strategic plan that has driven our history of long-term profitable growth. This strategy is centered on our ability to deliver a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers. The OD family of employees worked through every challenge thrown its way in 2021 and continued to deliver best-in-class service, while skillfully managing the 19.4% growth in our LTL shipments per day for the full year. I can assure you that delivering on time, without damage is a significant accomplishment with this type of volume growth. That is why I'm so proud that in 2021, we once again earned the Mastio Quality Award, which recognizes us as the national number one LTL carrier for the 12th straight year. Providing superior service not only allows us to win market share, it also supports our long term pricing strategy. We have consistently focused on improving our yields at the individual account level to both offset our cost inflation and support further investment in our business. This approach has helped strengthen our financial position over time, and allow us to do something that others in our industry have not consistently invest in new capacity. We have historically invested 10% to 15% of our revenue and capital expenditures each year, and we expect to spend approximately $825 million this year. We believe consistent and long term investments in capacity are valued by customers as an integral component of quality service. And these investments are also necessary to support our on-going market share initiatives. We simply never want our service center network to be a limiting factor to growth, which is why we have spent over $1.8 billion over the past 10 years to expand our service center capacity across the nation. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% of spare capacity in our network. Although our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes another $300 million to further expand our service center capacity to stay ahead of our anticipated growth curve. There are of course, two other ingredients in the capacity equation, our fleet and our people. We intend to spend 485 million for new tractors and trailers this year. We would frankly like to spend more but we have been limited by several suppliers that are facing manufacturing challenges. We are fortunate we're fortunate to enter the pandemic with one of the youngest fleets in our industry. And as a result, we can continue to use existing equipment that otherwise would have been replaced this year. This strategy may continue to cost us a little more in maintenance and repair costs as it did in 2021. But we believe our current fleet and these additions will be sufficient to accommodate our expected growth. As we have done in recent quarters, we also expect to continue to utilize purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our equipment. The final ingredient and the most important piece of our strategic plan is the investment that we continuously make in our people. The OD family of employees grew by 20% in 2021, which including added adding over 1700 drivers and a challenging labor market. We expect that 2022 will be another big recruiting year for OD. While the labor market remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to add to our team due to our outstanding company culture. In addition, we offer a rewarding pay and benefits package and certainly expect to make company record discretionary contribution to our employees' 401K retirement plan. Our long term strategic plan is straightforward, difficult for others to successfully replicate and builds on itself year-after-year. Our success over the years has proven the flywheel effect of our strategic plan and we believe it will spin even faster in 2022. We are encouraged by the opportunities ahead and we are confident that the disciplined execution of this strategic plan will produce further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Jack, I'll take a shot at that. And I'll let Adam add to this, but you're right. From what we have seen and from talking with our customers, we expect continued growth. It looks like if anything to see e-commerce is continuing to drive the LTL market. And the industrial economy has been strong. And everything that we see on the horizon is, is we expect continued growth. I want to roll back to the COVID question that you asked prior. Just for everyone's information and I'm sure somebody else intends to ask this. But we have seen our numbers go in the right direction over the last several weeks. And I think it's important to note, I think we've heard the same thing, all the news is as to what's happening around the country, but our trend has been really positive the last few weeks and our cases are really down. And it looks like from our perspective, this thing could be dying out. So hopefully, that's happening everywhere. And I think if it is that'll sure be a boost to everything related to the economy and certainly to conducting business more as normal and a long time since normal. But hopefully we can get back to that. And I'll let Adam add to that longer term growth question. Tom, I can tell you, we don't have any volumes at this point in time to go back to truckload. I think if you look at what we've done and what we've been able to take out over the course of time due to capacity restraints, and whatnot. Most of those type volumes are out of our network at this point. So I don't -- I think the environment for us from that standpoint is extremely positive, as far as we can see through 2022. Certainly things change as you go through the year. But right now, I don't see any volume going over the truckload at all. Not from our standpoint. And, as Adam has mentioned numerous times, we're continuing to add capacity. I would expect that we'll be on a strong trajectory all year along. I think our biggest wins have come from our ability to service the customers as they see the need. I mean, a lot of our competitors just haven't been able to provide the capacity that we have. And that's what that's my opinion as to why we've taken the share that we have. Just to get back to that share growth over the last five years. And Adam, you may need to help me here. But I was pretty say it's pretty fair to say we've been growing about that share about 1% a year. It's kind of a creep, if you will, it's not really a, a leap by any stretch. But, but it is has been very consistent. And we continue to see that as we get. As far as the service center network and whatnot, Adam mentioned, we're looking at 8 to 10. This year, we've got quite a few in the process. Now the good thing is some of those are, are fairly large, there's a couple big ones in my area that will give us quite a few additional doors. So I think we're going to be in a good spot. We, as I've mentioned, in over the last several years on all of our calls, I think we talked about the places where we're challenged, and we still got places that are challenged to expand and whatnot. But we do have some good ones working and I think we're going to be better off as the year progresses. We'll see how the growth trends and whatnot. But I think we're in a really good spot. And I would expect that that work is going to pay off for us. Yes Todd. Certainly, we're trying to add labor as we speak there. It has been a challenge, as I mentioned before, but we have been able to successfully add folks and right now we have needs, certainly as we get into the stronger parts of summer season, later in the spring, and certainly through the summer, in the fall, we need to continue to add folks without a doubt. So I would expect that those trends would pretty much mirror our shipment growth, and [Indiscernible] is growth. So I don't expect that to be a whole lot different. But yes, we need to add and those efforts are certainly underway if it's fallen. I wouldn't, I don't think so. I think we just got to keep doing our thing and providing value to our customers. And I don't I don't see that as a negative certainly. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 31.4% to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and our operating ratio improved 270 basis points to 73.6%. The combination of these changes resulted in a 49.7% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.41 for the quarter. Our revenue growth included a nice balance of increases in both volume and yield, which are both supported by a favorable domestic economy. We believe we are currently winning a significant amount of market share based on a comparison of our shipment trends with publicly disclosed information for other LTL carriers. Our LTL funds per day increased 14.3% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 16.1% Our LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 9.2% due primarily to the success of our long term pricing strategy, as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, fourth quarter LTL shipments per day increased 0.1% over the third quarter of 2021, which compares favorably to the 10-year average sequential decrease of 3.5%. LTL funds per day increased 2.4% as compared to a 10-year average sequential decrease of 1.7%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. For January, our revenue per day increased 25.7% as compared to January of 2021. This growth included a 7.7% increase in LTL funds per day, and a 16.8% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 73.6% and once again included improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, productive labor as a percentage of revenue improved 320 basis points, which more than offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in our operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel. We continue to use purchase transportation during the quarter to supplement the capacity of our workforce and our fleet. And we expect to use a similar amount of these third party services in the first quarter. We were very proud that our annual operating ratio of 73.5% surpassed our previous internal goal of 75%. As we execute on a long term continuous improvement cycle for our operating ratio, we intend to follow the same successful approach that we have in the past, which is to focus on density and yield. The spare capacity within our ever growing network allows us to drive additional volumes through our system, which generally create strong incremental margins at the local service center level. We're confident in our ability to further improve our operating ratio and it dropped our internal goal another 500 basis points. As a result, we will now be focused on achieving an annual operating ratio in the 60s [ph]. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations total $340 million and $1.2 billion for the fourth quarter, and 2021 respectively. All capital expenditures were $165.4 million and $550.1 million for the same period. Greg mentioned earlier that we currently expect capital expenditures in 2022 have approximately $825 million. This total includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. Although we would increase this amount further if we identify additional properties that fit into our long term strategic plan. We would also increase our expenditures for new equipment if availability improves during the year. We paid $23 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. While we did not utilize cash for share repurchases, our $250 million accelerated share repurchase program remained active during the fourth quarter. We utilized $691.4 million of cash for our shareholder return programs during 2021. And that consisted of $599 million for share repurchases and $92.4 million for cash dividends. We were pleased that our board of directors approved a 50% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2022. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 25% as compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. We currently expect an effective tax rate of 26.0% for 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time. Sure. And good morning, Jack. There were several things impacting January and certainly every January we deal with whether it's not a onetime event, and it's included in all of our 10-year average trends that we typically compared to similar to the effect of COVID in certain months of last year, when you only look on a one month period. We did have some effect. We felt like both directly and indirectly with customers that were impacted through labor shortages and so forth. And so we saw a little bit of that impact as well during the month and we came off an incredibly strong December. So to talk about December first a little bit just on a weight per day basis. December's tons per day was down 1.1% our 10-year average is a decrease of 9.1%. So from a sequential standpoint, we felt like, we were going to see that that build up in December coming off November that had a little bit of some of the same effects that we talked about earlier. So we expected that, but the timing of Urient [ph] also had a little bit of effect of both helping December, and then starting out that first day of January, being a lot softer. We don't typically get into these half day conventions and so forth, like some others do. But I would just say that first day of the month was certainly not a full normal day, like what we saw for the remainder of the month. So with all that said, we still grew revenue, that 25%. We're really pleased to see that we saw a continuation of the strong yield trends continue in solid volume performance, given all the factors that we just discussed. Yes Jack, I would just repeat what Greg said and certainly feel like there continue to be tailwinds to the industry. And we feel like the industry has already been growing above GDP and believe really, that that the industry as a whole could have grown more. But we \u2013 the industry continues to be capacity constrained and that's why we talk about the service advantages that we have in the marketplace, as well as the capacity advantages that have driven much of our growth. And we probably could have grown even faster this year. But it's something that we've certainly taken advantage of all the investments that we've made over time. We've invested a lot in our network, over $1.8 billion, the last 10-years growing our door count over 50%, while our shipment count has grown over the last 10 years about 70% or so. When you look at the other group of public carriers, there's been a decrease in the number of service centers in the industry. So and then for that reason, the other carriers that total shipments managed by the group is pretty flat as well. So we'll see how that continues to trend but there's service value that we add. And I think our customers are starting to appreciate that more when they look through their supply chain in total in leveraging an LTL carriers network. That's why it's so important that we continue with our yield improvement initiatives to continue to have the financial strength to invest further in our system to allow us to continue to grow with our customers because that's a big piece of the overall quality equation and that serve as well that we deliver they can call on us and they certainly are doing so when you look at our volume performance this year, customers are increasingly calling on us to deliver for them because of capacity shortfalls that they're experiencing through either other carriers or other modes. Thanks, Jack. Yes, I think that, on the length of haul, just to address that piece, your question first. Yes, it was a little bit longer. We were at 944 miles in the fourth quarter, but we've been around 935 miles to 945 miles. When you look longer term, we've seen length of hauls decrease, we've certainly seen this regionalization of kind of going back to the longer term question, we believe is regionalization of the industry will continue and we're seeing good growth and our next day and second day lanes. But the last couple of years, there's been pockets of growth in different places. We've had tremendous growth off the west coast, which typically has a little bit longer length of haul with it. So there's just been some different growth and in different areas with certain customers that it's moved it up a little bit, but it's pretty much staying within a fairly consistent band and, and I wasn't really expecting material change from where we are other than eventually getting back to the scene decreasing a little bit. And with regards to the yield performance, for us, we have a long term consistent strategy that that focus was all in trying to achieve yield improvement to offset our cost inflation each year. And, and we need cost plus, because again, it gets back to supporting the investments that customers are demanding from us in additional real estate capacity, as well as into our technologies as well, from a revenue per shipment standpoint, just getting away from the per 100. Because certainly, some of those metrics that change in weight per shipment, the change in the length of haul both had the effect of increasing the revenue per hundredweight, but our revenue per shipment, excluding the fuel was up 6%. And that was a good performance. But overall, we had to see some higher renewals kind of in the back half of the year, our cost inflation on a per shipment basis. And the back half of the year was a little bit higher than what we had anticipated the average cost per shipment for the full year would be and we'll see that trend a little bit higher in the first half of next year and then kind of normalized, but certainly we're continuing to get increases to offset that cost inflation. So those renewals in the back half of this year, has probably been a little bit higher than those in the first half of 2021 that is. And so, it's always just a continuous improvement cycle that we have. We look at each account on its own operating merits the freight that we get and ways that we can improve yield. And that's not always through price, either. So, I think we've been successful. Certainly when you look at that revenue per shipment, cost per shipment, delta in the fourth quarter, and really for the full year as well, just reinforces that that long term consistent approach that we've strived for. Sure. So the per hundredweight with the fuel, as we said earlier was between 16.5% at 16.8% without fuels right at 11%. So we're still seeing increasing rates really on the average price per gallon. And as that increase through the year, it's the average in January was up about 39% versus January of last year just for the national average there. So that fuel price component is certainly picking up and going into both the that revenue component, but also getting into the cost as well. And certainly, there's more than just the direct cost of diesel fuel that we use in our operations. As fuel prices go higher, that certainly works its way into tires and other components we have to deal with. So anything that's sort of fuel related, we'll see that same type of inflation or, with that said, and in regards to our costs, typically the fourth quarter, the first quarter sequential is about 100 basis point deterioration. Now one thing to say before I get into, a little bit more detail about that is typically that includes kind of a flattish, when you look at the insurance and claims line, kind of flat performance from 4Q to 1Q. We had a benefit in the fourth quarter, as you could see on that insurance and claims line. And that mainly comes from the actuarial assessment that we do each year, that was only seven tenths of a percent, where we averaged 1.1% to 1.2%, in the first three quarters of 2021. We expect that number to go back up to about 1.2% in the first quarter, give or take. So we've got a little natural drag, if you will, versus our normal sequential performance, if you will. With that said, however, we're still targeting about 100 basis points of change there and plus or minus, certainly, that's just one specific number. But I think that given the strong revenue performance, I think that we can offset much of that. So maybe 80 basis points to 120 basis points is to give us a little range, there will be what we're trying to target achieving in 1Q. And certainly the one key performance, when you look at the average, a lot goes into that the revenue effect like we mentioned earlier can be a little different from one period to the next. And certainly there's the calls that come in, that's not as consistent performance from 4Q to 1Q, like there is and maybe some of the other quarters, just given the natural disruption that happens in those periods. But that natural disruption goes into that 10-year average. And we didn't put a timeline per se on it, because really we're looking for, for profitable growth each year. And some years we get a little bit more revenue contribution. Some years, we get a little bit more margin contribution; they all go into that profitable growth line. And we pretty much played 2021 like a piano [ph] and got a little bit of both revenue and margin. So we were pleased to see that and followed a very successful 2020. So the five year of 200 bips is probably a little bit stronger, given the performance in 2018 as well. When you look over a longer term, it's been more in the 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And we talked about 10 years sequential from quarter-to-quarter. And that's probably been more in that long term. But right now, demand continues to be incredibly strong. So we certainly are expecting another very solid revenue performance here this year. And we're going to be investing dollars, investing significantly for headcount growth, as Greg mentioned. So we can continue to give the same service that our customers expect, and we're going to be adding to our fleet and into our network. So there's a lot of investment that goes into the continuing to take advantage of the market share opportunities that we feel are out there. So it's not, we're not going to give a specific goal for what we think we can do in 2022, but, but certainly the focus will be to produce as much profitable growth as we can. Jordan, you broke up a little bit. So I don't know if I missed anything at the start. But just in regards to the volume environment. Again, it just gets back to the underlying strength of demand. And certainly, that's all the customer feedback that we've been hearing, coupled with capacity issues and other places of our customers supply chains. When we look at the economic trends, we feel like that, we would expect continued strength with our industrial related customers, as well as the on-going strength with our retail related customers as well. So, we're, we're used to tough comps, if you will. Given our long term revenue performance over the last 10 years, that's pretty much we've produced about 11% average growth in revenues. And even though we'll follow up, what would have been a record growth year of $1.2 billion of new revenue produced last year, we certainly have got big expectations for 2022 just given all those factors. So we'll see how the, the comparisons work out. And I think that if you just assumed normal sequential trends, that would still put us at kind of the high, single digit, low double digit type range. Yes, Tom, we've kind of just stopped talking about contractual renewals, because I've somewhat feel like, that's, that's obviously a very big piece of the overall revenue equation, about 25% of our business is on our tariffs business, and certainly the majority being on contract. But it seems like it's a talking point from the others in the industry, that doesn't always reconcile with necessarily what you see out of the yield performance. But, it all just sort of goes into it, whether it's price increases, other operational changes, that drive yields, and so forth, and the things that we look for, we'll say that, like I mentioned earlier. We expect our, we saw higher cost per shipment in the back half of last year. We expect our cost per shipment this year, to probably be on a net basis, maybe in the 4.5% to 5% range. And that's excluding the effects of fuel but, but it's going to be weighted heavier, we're going to see higher costs per shipment inflation in the first half of the year, and then think that some of those expenses normalized, when we get into the back half and start laughing over where we've recently been seeing inflation in our business. So with that said, certainly the contracts that mature in the first half of the year, they didn't have as much of an increase last year, so they will probably get a little bit more and then those in the back half that maybe got a little bit higher increase reflecting what the actual cost trends were, in the back half of 2021 may not see as much. But overall, the focus continues. We've got to look at how our cost inflation is trending, and then trying to target 150 basis points above that. We did the January numbers, I did mention this earlier, but we did take our general rate increase, which is on our tariffs business that was affected the beginning of January. So that was a part of that yield performance that we've already seen to start off the year. Again, I think that, we've got to look at how our cost inflation at that time is trending. And, if we're seeing some normalization at that point, then then the expectation comes back. But at the end of the day, we've got to look at each customer's account, the revenue inputs and the cost inputs, and in terms of what we're actually seeing, and how the account is operating, and look at ways to drive improvement in that customers operating ratio. If we can do that by price, that's one way to look at it. There may be other operational changes, new pieces of business, that we may get different factors that that can overall drive an improvement. For us, we're looking at driving a continuous improvement cycle and each customer account and that customer account builds up to each individual service center and those builds to the company. So certainly, we're looking to improve the operating ratio, and that's how you got to go about tackling it. I wasn't given any specific guidance there. I was just basically saying that if you assumed normal sequential trends, in our tons that that what about the, if you just roll them out quarter by quarter, what the year might look like? But certainly, at this point we feel like just like what we saw last year that the demand is so strong out there. And we'll see how the year progresses. When in the past, we've typically had, probably about six quarters or so when you look through past growth cycles. We typically have had six or so quarters where we significantly exceed our 10-year trends. And then it kind of reverts back to the average and the average sequential performance for us includes a lot of market share wins. Going back to my previous comment, we've grown our shipments over the past 10-years around 70%. So those 10-year trends include a lot of market share, and we certainly think that given the comparison of our volumes that we've seen to the industry for the third quarter, that's kind of the way things have trended. We have this spare capacity that it's out there that we try to invest ahead of the curve, so that the network is not a limiting factor and we can help our customers grow when we get in these strong demand periods. So we'll see how the quarter-by-quarter is trending as we work our way through 2022. But the one thing we will say is that the underlying demand has not changed. It was consistently strong through 2021. And the customer conversations that we have today indicates that that strength is going to continue for the foreseeable future. We -- I think we've said before that we intend to add somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 to 10 service centers this coming year. We don't necessarily always share the door detail, for example, but when we look, we don't give it year-by-year more for strategic reasons. But if you look over the last 10 years, we've expanded the door count by about 50% in total. So as Greg mentioned before, we've got about 15% to 20% spare capacity in the network. We were fortunate that we started out 21 in a really good spot. So despite the 19.4% growth that we had in shipments during the year, we were still able to keep fair measure of spare capacity out there. So we'll continue to build on that level. We've got a few other things that will happen earlier in the year. Those were projects that already had been in the works, and some that we thought we might have been able to finish by the end of the year, but so we'll get some new capacity out there on the service center side pretty early. And we'll be adding to it pretty, pretty consistently throughout the year. Sure, yes. We we've talked about the cost structure in previous quarters. And effectively, our total direct costs, for last year, about 55% of revenue in our overhead was around 19% of revenue. And so some of that overhead, maybe 5% is also variable in nature. So when you look at the total variable costs, and that structure, that revenue growth can give us the incremental margins in the 35% to 40% range, in a short period of time. And certainly we did, I think, 39% for all of last year, so really strong operating leverage year for us. But our story, like I said, it's not just all margin improvement. We want to continue to build up the network to take advantage of the market share opportunities, which we feel are out there, and we want to keep growing the top line which takes investment. And so we know that we need to continue to invest, to keep taking advantage of that revenue growth opportunity and so that, that may call some quarters that the incremental margin might not be in that that 35% to 40% range, and that's okay. That's why we don't manage the business to an incremental margin per se. We're going to do the right things, right, that we feel like build out the network to allow us to keep achieving the top line growth and then have the ultimate effect of also driving long term margin improvement for us. Yes, I think that, we finally just sort of caught back up with it at the tail end of 2021. Then, we'd expect to see, probably the headcount a little bit stronger than the shipment count. Certainly probably for the first half of this year. But when you look over the longer term, those two numbers kind of work in concert with one another. They're pretty matched evenly. And I think that really the top line is what dictates it, Todd, and certainly last year, really going back to 2020. Once the recovery began which for us was in May we were pretty much playing catch up. We've had this tremendous volume performance. Really, unlike anything we've ever seen that with the fourth quarter being higher than the third, I mean, just really tremendous recovery since that drop in April of 2020. So we've continued to add people really at levels above what the normal sequential trends in headcount would be. I think that will continue in the first quarter until we get back to the levels where we can support the freight that we're seeing. But we've got to match it to with the, the equipment base that we have. And so it's just something that we've got to manage through as we work our way through the year. But as long as we keep seeing that, that top line, performance and strength coming at us, we're going to continue to try to hire and have the right people in the right place that is efficiently operating, keeping our service metrics best-in-class and taking care of our customer and the lever that will continue to pull. And we think that we'll have to keep using this and 2022 will be the purchase transportation, and we've had to utilize that. I think probably every quarter as we worked our way through last year, we talked about trying to get away from it. And ultimately, we do, we want that number to revert back to that old 2 to 2.5% that was there for our Canadian operation in a truckload brokerage business, where we've got 100% of our line haul network in source and we're using our people and our equipment to service our freight. But until then we've got some good partners and they're continuing to deliver within our service expectations and keep our service metrics best-in-class and, and really just helping us to be able to grow the top line. So we'll continue to pull that lever while we have to. Thanks, Todd. Yes, it's certainly the latter Bascome. This just, I don't know that it's the competition for real estate. Generally speaking, it's just being able to find real estate that we need and being able to get it sold and, and get the building done. Sometimes you can find the land and you know it's the hoops, you've got to jump through to get it zoned and, and meet all the building requirements and all those different things. But trust me, there's a lot of challenges out there. From a real estate standpoint, it's not easy. As we've grown, and as we require bigger and bigger facilities to meet our needs and to plan for years down the road. It's just gotten more and more difficult. But certainly there is some competition in certain locations. And I've talked about that numerous times before. But the competition in certain markets is definitely tougher than others. Some places it's still relatively easy, we can fund and meet our needs. But there are some that again, are rather challenging, if you will. Yes. One of those is in the Northeast that we've owned for several years now. It's been it was occupied with \u2013 tied up for the lease. We should get that late this year sometime. It's up in northern Pennsylvania. We own it today. But it's not available for the time being but we will get it to think about it. You probably have a little work to do to get it up and running. But that should come on late this year. We've got another fairly large facility in Southern Minneapolis, the southern part of Minneapolis to help us better serve that area. We're up on the north side now and certainly with the growth that we've had in that market, we need to have another facility in the South. It's getting closer like we're just a couple months away from opening that. We're working on a big one that's well underway in Kansas City that'll give us another additional fair amount of doors. So we had a lot of irons in the fire around the country and a lot of good things working. Again, I think we're pretty well positioned from that standpoint. Got a few others that I'll probably rather not talk about at this point, but a lot, a lot of work going on in the real estate department, that's for sure. Sure it's, I mean 70 is the target that we want to see something start with a six. So it will be 69, or whatever we get to when we crossed that, that line, we obviously blew through the 75, this year, pretty strong and have got a good, good jump on making our way towards that 70 goal. But nevertheless, that's the goal, if you will, at a raw 70. But seeing and know I'll start with the six. Well, I mean, there's some trade off there. And when you look at the depreciation expense for example, we're seeing some improvement there, that was at 4.7% of revenue. And that typically runs quite a bit higher. So we're seeing some increased maintenance costs, if you will to maintain our fleet, our average fleet ages up to five years. Now, for our power equipment, it's been as low as three and a half years, when you look over the last five, seven years or so. And so it's certainly a bit higher than then what we would like to see. And, but there's, there's also a little bit of a drag, just in total operating supplies and expenses on the fuel element, the older equipment is not as fuel efficient as the newer equipment. So, that's just something that we've got to keep balance. We'll probably see once we can start replenishing the fleet at the levels that we would like to, we'll see some incremental depreciation costs that will come online that will somewhat offset, the cost that we're seeing in operating supplies and expenses, but it will offset some of the purchase transportation costs that we're seeing. And certainly, I'm sure you're familiar with the, the truck load right environment is pretty strong right now. So those loads that we are moving with third parties, we're paying a pretty fair price for. Generally speaking, I think that can't speak for everyone. And we don't really know other than what we hear from customers. But we anticipated that we would see capacity issues with the industry this year, just based on some internal computations that we go through. And we started hearing that before we got to mid-year before the real rush began. And so I think that there's probably some needs out there. Like I mentioned, we still feel like the industry is growing. And when you look over the last 10 years, there's been a couple of other carriers that have also increased their market share. I think that the industry revenue is continuing to consolidate with the larger national non-union providers, and we think that that trend will continue in the future. But certainly, we've got service advantages as well. And it all comes back to the service value you deliver for your customer and we think we've got an unmatched value proposition that wins market share for us and we're going to continue to execute and keep giving the very best service to our customers. And we think that that will drive the market share and feel in the real estate capacity that that we continue to expect to add. Well, I think what we'd expect, Chris is that the, the industry has been very priced disciplined, really going back to the last slowdown in 2016. And so I think that we've seen some margin improvement by some of those other carriers. If they don't have capacity, maybe they'll continue to follow our lead in terms of continuing to consistently try to increase price. When you look at the current environment, much of the revenue growth is coming by yield from other carriers. I get back to the third quarter performance. We grew our shipments 19% on average, the public carrier group was up 1%. So that wide delta in volume growth, we want to have that volume contribution, and we've got the capacity to grow both volumes and yields, whereas we've seen in prior growth periods, like 2017, 2018, what we've seen this year, or 2021 rather, the other carriers that don't have barely any capacity to grow throughout their entire system, just take advantage of the strong demand and increase yields which if they're increasing faster us because again, our pricing approaches one that's long term and consistent customers know what to expect. If other carriers are increasing their rates faster than us and closing some of that price gap, that service value looks better and better. And so, I think that's what we've seen in the past. It's what we would continue to expect to see to see that wide outperformance if you will against the other public area group data that we see on average. Yes, I mean, it's certainly, we constantly communicate with, with our customers, and including third party logistics companies to try to navigate through and foresee the types of changes that are coming down the line. That goes into some of our thinking in terms of how we expand our service center network as well, and, and where we're building facility. So we certainly foresee some of those, those changes that have been happening over the last 5 years, 10 years continue. I think they've all been favorable transfer of the LTL industry, and I think we're certainly maybe benefiting more than anyone. And the reason for that and some of how we think some of this market share growth we've seen recently will be very sticky is that there's a increased premium that's being placed on service quality. And when you think about especially as low as inventory balances are right now, shippers have got to get their product on the shelves. And so they're increasingly relying on a carrier that can give 99% on time service performance and not have damages. And if you're delivering into one of the big retailers that have these chargeback programs in place then it puts an even more importance if you will on that, that service value. So that's how we're winning share in that that retail segment of the market. Certainly we've still got our healthy mix of industrial freight and think that that will continue to grow as well. But we're really winning across all segments, if you will, with direct industrial and retail related customers and seeing tremendous growth with our third party logistics customers as well. So, but we think that those trends are going to continue and the importance on total service value will continue to rise."

Thank you in advance for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, he Old Dominion team produced strong profitable growth that included new company records for quarterly revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2021 was our third straight quarter with double digit revenue growth and the fifth straight quarter of double digit growth in earnings per diluted share. While our revenue results reflect the unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service, our ability to grow at these impressive rates is the result of our long term commitment to consistently invest in capacity. We continue to have available network capacity as well as best-in-class service, both of which are qualities that differentiate us within our industry and provide a distinct competitive advantage for Old Dominion. These qualities have also supported our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth over the long term. With continuing strength in the macroeconomic environment and limited industry capacity, we believe demand for transportation services will continue through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. As a result, we expect our business level momentum that began in the third quarter of 2020 will also continue. To take advantage of these opportunities and produce further profitable growth we believe that it will be important for us to continue to execute on the long term strategic plan that we have operated under for many years. This strategy focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest into capacity and technology to support our customer supply chain needs. Our most important investment, however, will continue to be in the OD family of employees. Our people are critical to our success as they work tirelessly each day to provide service value to our customers. We added over 1,000 new full-time employees between June and September of this year. These additions resulted in a 20.9% increase in our average full-time headcount as compared to the third quarter of 2020. While we have grown the OD family this year, the capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support future growth. As a result, we expect that we will continue to add new full-time employees to our team during the fourth quarter and next year. We believe further additions will be necessary to prepare for anticipated growth and to also reduce the use of third-party purchase transportation. We expect to use third-party purchase transportation during the fourth quarter at levels similar to the third quarter. While we would like to reduce this level of utilization, we must continue to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet in support of our topline revenue performance. We hold the third parties that we work with to the same standards of excellence and our team remains fully committed to providing best-in-class service to our customers. Our customers' expectations for excellence do not change, regardless of how we move their freight and given the supply chain challenges that many of them are currently facing, we want them to have complete confidence in our ability to deliver. Old Dominion set the standard in our industry with our ability to provide superior service and service center capacity to support our customers' growth. As a result, we believe we are in a better position than any other carrier to win additional market share and further increase shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's (revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%. The combination of these changes led to a 44.4% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.47 for the quarter. Our revenue growth was balanced between LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strong domestic economy and capacity issues within the industry. Our LTL funds increased 13.7% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 15.7%, which also reflects the impact on our fuel surcharge program from the increase in diesel fuel prices. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.1% as a result of the continued success with our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 3.2% over the second quarter 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 2.9%. LTL tons per day increased 1.0% as compared to the 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. These 10- average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. At this point in October, with only a few work days remaining in the month our revenue per day has increase by approximately 33% to 35% when compared to October 2020. We will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the third quarter improved 190 basis points to 72.6% as a result of the operating leverage created by our revenue growth as well as our continued focus on operation efficiency. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 200 basis points, due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. As a percent of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits improved 320 basis points between the periods compared. Our productive labor cost within this expense category improved 200 basis points which more than offset the 130 basis point increase in purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $364.3 million and $872.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $178.69 and $384.7 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $565 million for this year. The $40 million decrease from our prior estimate is mainly due to the timing on large real estate projects that will be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about 2022 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release, but at this time we expect to increase our expenditures to support our ongoing market share initiatives and to reduce the average age of our fleet. We continued to return capital to shareholders during the third quarter through our dividend and share repurchase programs, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that will expire no later than March 2022. For the first nine months of this year, the cash utilized for shareholder return programs included $599 million for share repurchases and $69.4 million of cash dividends. Effective tax rate for the third quarter 2021 was 25.2% as compared 24.8% in the third quarter 2020. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi. Thanks good morning guys. Maybe to start off, the tonnage trends, Adam, you mention, the tonnage trends of the quarter. I mean you are a little bit below sequentially what is normal. And clearly, we saw a little bit of a deceleration in August before it seems like September picked back up. So could you talk a little bit about sort of business conditions in the quarter and maybe what we saw intra-quarter and how that's played out as moves here into early October.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage for as well to point out is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower wait for shipment rather. And that's the change that we talked about in recent quarters as we continue to focus on more traditional LTL shipments and try to work out some of these larger, harder to handle type of shipments that are more transactional in nature generally within our system. So that had a little bit of an impact overall and that discrepancy, if you will, between the tons and the shipments. When we look at shipments, they were on a sequential basis just above what the 10-year trend would have been at 3.2% versus the 2.92%, a little discrepancy there. But back to the point of your question, when we look at really the volumes in general but tonnage and shipments as we work through the quarter, we were right in line with normal sequential trends in July versus June but then had a pretty big step back in August. Our tons per day in August, decreased 1.6% from July. The 10-year average changes is 0.5% increase there. And a big reason for that was the fact that we started seeing across the country the rise in COVID cases and just the ongoing labor issues that are affecting many customers and warehouses throughout the country. That certainly had an effect on business directly and indirectly, really. So that was an issue that caused us, in some cases, to not be able to pickup freight when we couldn't be able to deliver it And so there was certainly a ripple effect, I think, throughout the economy and reflected in our business results as well. But as cases started to improve, some of that pickup back in the labor participation rates, we saw significant recovery. Really, it began towards the end of August but really accelerated through the month of September, such that our tons per day in September were up 5.2% over August versus the 10-year average change of 3.7%. So it certainly made up for that and so as we accelerated through the end of the quarter.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's very helpful day. And it seems like revenue per day in October would suggest that maybe that trend has continued. So kind of curious about that. But as a follow-up, I kind of wanted to get a sense of, with the context of tonnage and obviously with very strong pricing environment, but obviously you are hiring at a rapid clip. I would imagine, there's some inflation on that side. How do we think about the normal sequential cadence of operating ratios as we look through the fourth quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Well, Greg mentioned in our prepared remarks, we will continue to focus on bringing on new employees as we go through the fourth quarter. And it's something that frankly we have been doing all year. If you look at the change in our volumes and change in people, we have exceeded what our normal sequential trends have been, I think, for five straight quarters. So that's something that we think will continue given the strength of the demand environment that we certainly feel very confident that that will extend into the 2022. So it's important for us to continue to really build up all the elements of capacity that we need in our business and that people, fleet and the service center side to be able to accommodate our customers' expectations for growth and to be able to continue to deliver best-in-class service to them. With that said, I still feel good about the performance in the third quarter. We were pretty much right in line to sequential operating ratio performance, it was right in line with normal trends. And that factored in a lot of calls that are coming onboard. We still face some of those cost challenges. But we would expect to be right in line with what our normal sequential change is from 3Q to 4Q. And that's typically in the 200 to 250 basis point increase from the third quarter. I think that we should be able to be in that range while we will have some calls continuing to come at as, both in relation to the investment in new employees. We are still taking delivery on some equipment. So we have got some cost pressures there. But we have still got incredible topline revenue performance that's helping to offset those and certainly yield performance has continued to be strong. But as you alluded to, with the change in our volumes and overall revenue for October, we are performing well above what the normal sequential trends would otherwise be on the volume inside and pricing strength is certainly continuing as well.\nChris Wetherbee: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Hi. Yes. Just a follow-up, I guess, on some of the headcount related things. When you think about volume growth, whatever the expectations are in the headcount need, should it roughly track once we get past this year, headcount and volumes? Or do you need less headcount relative to volume growth? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Jordan, I think it will continue to tract, to some extent. But you have got to remember, ewe have really chasing it for the most part all year. As our growth has accelerated, we continue to chase our needs and continue to play catch-up to some degree. But I do think that we will start to moderate and level back out to more normal type pace going forward. At least that's what we hope.\nJordan Alliger: Okay. And then I assume, as others, you are seeing in order to get the people and you have had good success, obviously and the need to push up the wage per employee or cost per employee, however you want to look at it.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We have done the same thing this year that we have done in years past. We gave our annual rate in September and in some cases we have had to increase starting wages. We have had some places where we have had referral bonuses and those kind of things. So we have had lock-up matching in quarters past. We are having success. We just have to work a little harder at it and do things a little bit differently, whatever it takes to get the folks onboard. But you were having success and I expect we will continue to do so.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Morning, all. So maybe the first question is along that similar trend. You guys are well known to keep your 25% excess capacity. How does that trend over the next several quarters, do you think? Is now the right time to build that buffer, given the higher cost of building capacity in the current environment? And also what are your competitors doing? Are they batten the hatches and trying to get price? Or everybody in the industry also trying to build capacity?\nAdam Satterfield: Ravi, we are still at about 15% to 20% excess capacity and that's in the service center network which is the most important in the LTL businessman. I mean it certainly takes people in trucks but that's the longest term form of capacity and the hardest to put in place. And we have been consistent with our investments over the years and we will continue on that front as we finish out this year and then transitions into next year. But that's about at the same point that we were when we finished last quarter as well. So despite the strong sequential volume performance that we had in 3Q, we have been able to keep that excess capacity level at about the same spot. So we are going to keep after it and keep adding to those capacity levels. And certainly, as Greg mentioned, we have got to really continue to be focused in the short term on continuing to add people into the mix. And that's probably been in our biggest need all year as we work through the balance of the year. But it really takes all three forms. And we came into this year, we don't really know exactly what our competitors' strategies are but we came into this year believing that we had more capacity than anyone. And that really goes back to our 10-year investment that we have made. We have expanded our door count by over 50% over the last 10 years. We have seen very little investment from some of the others, maybe a service center here and there but nothing at any major scale. And so that has created an environment for us to be able to win more market share than anyone else. And certainly, we believe we still got best-in-class service. So we have got a service advantage in the marketplace and we have got more capacity than anyone else. And that gives us the capacity advantage in the marketplace and that usually produces pretty phenomenal results when we get into the strong demand periods like we have been in this year and what we expect to see for next year as well. So it gives us a lot of confidence to say, we are the best positioned carrier to continue to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value, even from the levels from which we are currently operating.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's great detail. Maybe just follow-up on the capacity thing. Just on new trucks, do you feel like you are going to get all the trucks that you need in 2022? Or does that look like something that happens in 2023 or maybe in 2024?\nAdam Satterfield: We think we are going to get what we have asked for. At this point in time, there is no indication that we will not. So we will have to wait and see, obviously, but so far the outlook for a truck standpoint is good.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Greg, in the last call you mentioned hopes for maybe nine new terminals by the end of this year, although acknowledging that some will definitely pushed into 2022. Can you give us an update on the pace for the remainder of this year? What you have line of sight on for early 2022? And if we can even take a step further and think about, holistically, the next 12 months, what's your kind of ideal on additional capacity as it relates to either terminal count or door count?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. The terminal count, Jon, I think we have got another three or four that we expect to open in this calendar year. And we have numerous others that we are working on for next year. I can't give you an exact number but I am going to say, we are in about the eight to 10 range for next year, something like that. So we have got a lot of projects that we were in the middle and then we have got an awful lot on the list to start as we go forward. But just remember, lot of those things, they take time, what's like pulling teeth, if you will, in some cases. But we are working on locations where we need help and where we think we know we could be capacity constrained. So with all that and hope to continue to be able to accomplish whatever, wherever our needs are.\nJon Chappell: Okay. And my follow-up will be along the same lines. I think when some people here, capacity expansion or terminal expansion, their immediate thought goes to start-up costs and potentially weighing on the aggregate margin. Given the size of your network today, is there just better scale of onboarding a new terminal so that the immediate tonnage impact from that has a pretty de minimis impact on the aggregate operating ratio of the entire firm?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We certainly start out, I mean we are covering all markets today. So when we open a new facility, it already starts with a good book of business, if you will and is pretty much profitable immediately. And so that also frees up some capacity in the existing service center that we move ZIP Codes and freight out of into the new location. So that's been part of our expansion process over the years and certainly we have invested a lot of dollars in expanding our network and that 50% increase in door count that I talked about earlier. But that kind of all goes into it and it's why when we talk about our yield management philosophy that we focus on getting an increase every year in our revenue per shipment to exceed what our cost per shipment inflation will be, but also to support the continued investment in our service center network. And as supply chains become more sophisticated, customers are leveraging our network to their benefits as we are processing freight through our network of about 250 service center today. So it's something that we are effectively purchasing real estate capacity on behalf of our customers and we want to be only that's really making the type of material investments that we have. So it's important for us to continue to keep that within the context of yield management so that we can afford these service centers that are becoming more and more expensive as we are competing with different parties to go out and find the real estate to continue to support our growth. But certainly, we have had great success in the past. We got a good team detail that's always trying to stay ahead of the growth curve and at the levels where we are, we feel like we have got us probably stay a little bit further ahead of the curve than we have had in years past. But we have got a good plan. We got a list of about 35 to 40 service centers that we think we want to add to the network in due time and probably won't stop there.. We feel like we have got a very long runway for growth ahead of us, given what our expectations for growth in the industry, given the consolidation in the industry and general lack of investment by the carriers it's certainly a great spot for us to be in to continue to be in a good position to win market share.\nJon Chappell: Yes. Absolutely. Thanks so much Adam. Very helpful. Thanks Greg.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, sir.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. So I wanted to ask you first maybe just on kind of broader supply chain constraints and how you think they affect you? Or perhaps they just don't? But obviously, there is a lot of discussion around the ports. And it's pretty clear there, truck load is constrained, wage is constrained intermodal as well. Is there any effect to your business to get some spillover freight? But just how do you think that some of the broader labor constraints and supply chain noise affect you? Is there some tonnage that's constrained or maybe some cost pressure? Or are you very pretty much immune to it?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know if we are immune to anything that's going on in the marketplace. But, Tom, we do see continued strength off the West Coast. I mean obviously there is a lot of stuff sitting out there in the water and as it continues to get into the warehouses and whatnot, we are seeing and feeling that strength in those markets. But certainly, was not immune to anything. And any change or any change of strategy or whatever by our suppliers or our customers will change some of the things that we have to do and possibly where the freight comes to, goes from, whatever. But right now, we adjust as is necessary. And so far, I would say, the impact has been somewhat minimal, if you will. Again, not immune to anything that's going on, but not a huge impact.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Okay. I appreciate it. Another pretty high level question. And then what about tonnage growth? I guess you talked about revenue per day in October. I don't know if you want to comment a bit more about tonnage. But how do you think about the ballpark for tonnage growth might be in fourth quarter? And what it potentially could be in 2022? Do you kind of go back to like mid single digit or high single digits next year? Or how do you broadly think about the framework for tonnage growth in 4Q? And I know it would be high-level for next year.\nAdam Satterfield: We don't want to give any specific guidance per se. But the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter. Those two numbers were pretty close. On the yield side, obviously recently fuel prices have continued to increase, so that overall revenue per hundredweight metric will continue to reflect that number. But again, we are still seeing considerable strength on the volume side as well. Certainly, as we go through the period we think about the comparisons, the comparisons certainly get a little tougher each month as we work through the fourth quarter. It was last year, our volumes were accelerating month after month, such that the third quarter was a bit of really strong outperformance versus what our normal trends have been. Typically, we see strong performance for five or six quarters like that and then kind of revert to normal sequential trends which, by the way, reflect a whole lot of market share gain over the past 10 years. When you think about our shipments per day, they are averaging about 50% increase versus where we were 10 years ago. So there is a lot of market share gains that are in those numbers. But overall, I think if you just were to say that we operate on d normal sequential trends, that us with some pretty strong numbers on the volume side next year. And we don't want to say that's what the forecast is. But right now, we haven't seen any letdown with respect to demand. So it's hard to call that we are going to see any slowdown. And certainly based on customer conversations and everything that we see and read, we feel like this unprecedented level of demand that we have seen this year will continue into next year, especially if other carriers are continuing to be capacity constrained. That certainly could continue to just push more and more volumes our way. And so, we just got to be in a c position to continue to bring it onboard and make sure we are focused on profitable growth, which is what our long term focus has been and continue to take care of our customers in offering them solutions in various ways, be it handling all their LTL shipments, using out truckload brokerage division to help them out with any truckload moves as that's put and then the grades division that we have in our non-LTL as well which is mainly focused in the Southeast is seeing a lot of strength there. So it all comes back to building a relationship with your customer and trying to continue to serve them as best you can. And we are going to continue with that focus as we transition into 2022, but not keeping our eye off the ball with respect to the fourth quarter as well. We still got a lot of work to do to finish out this year with strength.\nTom Wadewitz: It sounds like your resource additions, your headcount, you are set, it seems line, you are planning for pretty good growth next year as well, just what you are doing on headcount. Is that fair?\nAdam Satterfield: Fair. Yes, sir. We still got to try to reduce this purchase transportation. We like to get back to managing the business completely in source from a line haul standpoint. And that's what we have done in the past and we are using it to supplement the team right now, again just getting back to being able to serve our customers. But certainly that's the focus. And it will take our headcount exceeding our shipment count. Over the long term, those two numbers are really aligned, the change in headcount, the change in shipments. But we have got to catch back up with things and we have been under the shipment growth, if you will, for the past year and year-and-a-half. And so it's going to take a period to sort of regain that to not only catch up with our business overall but really to be anticipating the growth that we are likely see next year.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hi. Thanks. Good morning guys.\nAdam Satterfield: Good morning Scott.\nScott Group: So you guys will clearly be sub-75% on operating ratio for the calendar year? I can't imagine you want to put a timeline on it. But do you feel like you have got line of sight to getting to about 70% or sub-70% OR over for the next several years?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that's something that we just got to continue to work at. When you look over the past two years, the improvement that we have had in the operating ratio, the two-year performance really has only been exceeded by the two-year performance back in 2010, 2011, coming out of the depths of the recession. So we are really proud of what we have achieved over the last few years and we feel confident to say that we know we have got room for further improvement. I think we will wait until we get to the fourth quarter to really start talking about kind of what our next target will be. But again, if you look over the long term, we have averaged 100 to 150 basis point improvement in the operating ratio each year and that's sort of gets back to that delta between our revenue and cost per shipment. So a lot go into each of those two numbers, us managing our cost and continuing to focus on productivity and offsetting all the cost that go along with expanding our model. And that creates some short term cost headwinds but when you look at the long term performance for what we have done over the past 10 years, producing an average of 10% to 11% change in revenue each year and about 25% average annual increase in our EPs, that's driven considerable share value over that 10 year period and we want to continue to do that as we look out into the next 10 year horizon as well. So certainly a lot of opportunity, but of a lot of hard work and focus on execution on our part to make it happen.\nScott Group: Okay. And then I want to ask on the labor side. I know we have touched on headcount. I guess, two things. Do you feel the need for wages or comp per employee to increase more than normal given inflation? And then just any thoughts on vaccine mandate and what your expectations are there? How you are planning for it? Do you think it's going to happen, carve-outs, things like that?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Scott, as I mentioned before, we have had to do some things a little bit different from a pay and benefit standpoint, pay mainly. We look at benefits every year and see where we can make improvements. And we have done that over the course of time. But I don't think we have got to do anything drastically different from a pay standpoint. We did give an annual increase again this past September as we have done in years past. And again, we have had to do referral bonuses and hiring bonuses in those certain locations where we are really challenged to find folks. But I don't think it will be significantly different going forward what we have to do. Like I said before and I have said over the years, we can still get people. We just have to work harder at doing it. And I think we will continue with that focus. We are always looking for ways and different avenues to accomplish whatever the hiring needs that we have are. So we will continue to do that. What was that last question you asked about vaccines?\nScott Group: Yes. I was just asking your thoughts on vaccine mandate and what you are doing to plan for it.\nGreg Gantt: Well, yes, we would love to have some clear line of sight as to just exactly what's coming down the line. I know you have heard the same thing we have heard and there's a mandate supposedly coming. But I am not exactly sure where that is right now. I think you also know that we actually, back about four months ago, we offered our employees an incentive to get vaccinated. And we have had some success with that. As far as the mandate goes, that would be extremely difficult, in my opinion. It's either get vaccinated or do the testing. We are still working on that and trying to figure out how we can accomplish testing the numbers of folks that we would have to test on a weekly basis. Extremely, extremely difficult to accomplish, I don't want to say impossible. But there are some challenges there that I think are going to be very difficult if it comes to that. And God help our industry, if it does. If you think we have got supply chain issues now across the country, that could really throw it into some kind of a crazy tailspin. But we will see where it goes. But hopefully, clear heads will prevail at some point.\nScott Group: Are you hearing that? Do you have confidence in that? 1 mean everyone says the same thing, it would be a disaster. Are you confident that the government gets that?\nGreg Gantt: Confident that the government gets that? No, not at all. I sure hope at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. I know there are some forces in Washington. I think the ATA is working on a couple of different things. And hopefully, we will have some success with that, exempting truckers, whatever the strategy might be. But at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. There's a place for that. I am not sure we have used a whole lot of it to this point. But certainly, there is a place for that as it relates to vaccines and mandates and whatnot. I think the other thing is, fortunately, the numbers we are seeing are moving in the right direction. As far as COVID goes, they are really dropping. I saw something on the news this morning where we are down to a 4%-something positivity rate. Maybe that was just for the state of North Carolina, I am not sure. But the numbers do look a lot better than they did back several months ago. So again, I think if you take that into account with where we are as far as the numbers of cases and those kind of things, surely, at some point, common sense will prevail.\nScott Group: Thank you guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up on the long term margin question. Adam, for a while, you have kind of pegged incrementals at 25%. Obviously, it's been much better than that, just given how much shipment growth has outpaced expense growth. But obviously, that's reversing a little bit and incrementals seem to kind of be coming down settling maybe in the low 30% level. And those types of incrementals obviously imply kind of about 70% OR. That's really sort of the plateau for the company versus kind of the very low-70s you are doing now. Is there anything, Adam, in that kind of framework that you would disagree with? Do you think structural incrementals have moved up relative to where you saw them a few years ago? Just talk about kind of how you see that framework evolving.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. One, we have said this before, but we don't manage the company to the incremental margin. That's just the calculation of all the work that we do in sort of building out the balancing the revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities. We had used that long term target of 25% really as an inverse to say we were working towards a 75% operating ratio goal. And that's really more of what we talk about within the company for where we think we can take the operating ratio. So I think we will give a little bit more color on that when we get to our fourth quarter call. Obviously, based on kind of what I mentioned earlier about the target for the fourth quarter, that puts us at an annual operating ratio somewhere around 74%. So it certainly looks like we will be able to beat that 75% OR target this year. And as it comes down to incremental margins, I think this will go down as our biggest incremental margin year in our history. And when we have talked about the cost structure with you before, we have laid out kind of the cost structure as balanced between our variable and fixed costs and how we can operate at a 35% to 40% incremental margin in a particular quarter in a short period of time. But we don't want to get overly fixated on incremental margins because, again, we are focusing on the investments that are required to drive long term growth. We don't measure the success of our business based on how strong an incremental can be. It's really some of those longer term numbers that I referenced earlier. And we want to be able to repeat that because we think there's a lot of growth opportunity left within our business. And so that's going to be the focus. But it requires investment and that can create some short term headwinds. And if that's the only lens that you look at things through, you miss out on a ton of opportunity to drive shareholder value. And so we are going to keep that long term focus, continue to make al the necessary investments. And if that drives the incremental down a little bit, one, I am pretty pleased with 33%. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at for the quarter and producing a very strong 72.6% operating ratio. But based on that cost structure breakdown, we feel confident in saying that we certainly can drive the operating ratio meaningfully lower. And whenever we get to whatever that next threshold might be, we will continue to look at managing the business and how the algorithm works. And it's not to say that whatever the next stopping point will be the final stopping point. We think that there's a lot of opportunity left here. So we will keep marching forward. The algorithm certainly has worked for us in the past and we think can continue to work for us into the future.\nAmit Mehrotra: Sure. Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up. You were helpful in providing tonnage for October or at least kind of at a high level. But obviously, when you deconstruct tonnage, weight has been a decent drag to tonnage. When do you think that cycles through because obviously that\u2019s implications for headcount relative to shipment growth? But when do you think like the cycling through of the weight per shipment drag happens and it's a little bit more of a neutral to the tonnage number?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. If you go back to the first quarter of this year, we were still at sort of a 1,600-pound range average. That dropped to 1,570 in the second quarter. And so I feel like we are probably likely to settle in this 1,550-pound range, kind of plus or minus 20 pounds or so. And so we will still have a little bit of a drag, if you want to call it that, with the first quarter comparison. But by 2Q, you should start to see that of next year more normalize and see the shipment and tonnage performance more comparable with one another.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Ho Greg, good morning and thank you for taking my question.\nGreg Gantt: Hi Jack.\nJack Atkins: I guess just to kind of think about pricing and yield momentum here for a moment, just based on the commentary that you guys have around the momentum in the business from a demand perspective and the expectation for that to continue into 2022. Can you maybe speak to the pricing momentum that you are seeing maybe in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year? And as you sort of look out into 2022, with truckload carriers talking about potentially double digit contractual rate increases. How should we be thinking about maybe the core price increases in the LTL market more broadly? Not speaking to OD specifically, but just kind of thinking about the potential for further yield acceleration in 2022.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think for the industry, if we continue to see this supply and demand imbalance, in the past, many of the carriers that are out of capacity certainly use the environment to push prices meaningfully higher and try to take advantage and improve the margin. So certainly, that type of environment is supportive of our pricing initiatives. For us, it's more of a long term consistent approach and one that we think is fair but equitable. It's one that we can sit down with our customers and talk about what our cost inflation is and what our needs are in terms of reinvesting in the business to either improve customer service or investing in ways that ultimately are going to reduce cost. So it's a win-win situation for both us and our customers. And so we try to target our cost inflation and then some and we have been pretty successful with that. And so that will continue to be the focus.  But with that said, we are always focusing on the individual account profitability. And so when you are in these types of environments, there are some accounts that their operating ratios are not as good as others. And those are the types of accounts that really over the last couple of years that we have had to address some issues and there's different ways to improve yield. It's not always through price. And so that's where you sit down and you build on your relationship together and work through different initiatives that ultimately can create the same results of yield improvement there. So certainly, given the expectation that the demand trends will remain very strong and given the lack of capacity that we believe is in the industry and that's mainly grounded in the feedback that we are getting from customers, we certainly expect there to be a strong pricing environment for the industry next year, for which we will be able to benefit.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's great. And I guess just maybe following up. Greg, kind of going back to a comment that you had in the press release around length of haul extending out on a year-over-year basis. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what's driving that? Is that a function of comps? Is that a function of maybe some changes to your own business mix? Just would be curious if you could maybe expand a little bit on that comment? And if that's maybe more of a structural change for you?\nGreg Gantt: Jack, as I mentioned before, I think we are seeing an awful lot of strength right now off of the West Coast. And obviously, all those containers sitting out there, that freight has got to move in, at some point. And I think that's why we are seeing the small increase in our length of haul. I don't know that there's anything else that would contribute to that.\nJack Atkins: Okay. All right. That makes sense. Thanks again for the time.\nOperator: The next question is from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. Adam, to the comments on the OR progression in the fourth quarter, I guess it's pretty encouraging that the expectation is to be in the historical range because it seems like that maybe headcount growth would be a little bit higher than what you typically have seen and purchase transportation is going to be elevated. So what are the things that are helping you stay within the normal range despite maybe adding a few more heads than you typically would in 4Q and running a little bit more PT?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that, one, the topline performance certainly helps offset a lot of cost. And we will see how the rest of the quarter shapes up, if you will. But typically, we see a little bit of softness, if you will, just about 0.5% to 1% drop in our revenue per day performance from 3Q to 4Q. And so based on the current performance, we are definitely outperforming October, if you will. So we will see where that puts us for the end of the quarter. But we are doing a lot of things with respect to managing costs. We talk a lot about the labor cost and that's probably 65% of total cost in our salary, wages and benefits line. And we have seen a lot of productivity this year, especially within our line haul and our pickup delivery operations. We have lost some productivity on the dock. So I think that the fourth quarter and the first quarter, that will be some opportunity that we continue to focus on. It's not that we haven't been focused on it. But I think that that's something that will help on the labor front if we can reduce the levels of purchase transportation and manage more freight with our people and our equipment. Certainly think that that will be beneficial as well, given the rates that we are having to pay. And we are using about the same level in October as we were in the third quarter. We hope that we will be able to reduce that level of utilization a little bit. But at this point, the topline trends have dictated all year. I think every quarterly call, we have had for the last four quarters, we have talked about wanting to be able to reduce that expense category. But the topline trends have really dictated that continued utilization. So we will see where that balances out. But there's just a lot of cost management that is here within the business and that we are focused on as well as continuing to see that strong topline performance that will help offset some of this inflation as we are bringing on new people. We will continue to see our benefit costs in the third quarter were higher and expect that that will likely continue as we are continuing to balance out the number of hours worked by our employees. As we increase that workforce, there's certainly going to be more incremental benefit costs that will be incurred. But we feel good about all the other contributing factors to help offset some of that cost inflation.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. Yes. That helps and all that makes sense. Just for my follow-up, I know that the timing of equipment deliveries can have an impact on particularly the depreciation side. This year, it looks like depreciation is going to run pretty much flat with last year. Do you look at 2022 as kind of being a catch-up where you see more depreciation come in based on timing of equipment deliveries? And I would expect there will be a little bit of put and take with PT probably coming down. But just any thoughts about how depreciation trends into 2022, just given the cost kind of tail that that can have?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly, we have seen the equipment deliveries delayed a little bit this year. We haven't finished completely with the delivery cycle at this point. But we do expect that all units ordered will be delivered to us and we have already had preliminary conversations with our OEMs about next year as well. And as Greg mentioned, we believe we will get all of the equipment that we need to be able to manage the growth that we are anticipating. But that has resulted in some depreciation that's kind of come in, in different periods. that too will be something that we are only about 80% through September complete with the CapEx order on the equipment. There will be some deliveries that we are taking here in the fourth quarter that will add to that depreciation base and then that will trend up as we go into 2022. But typically, you look at kind of the long term trends, there's a pretty consistent factor of what our CapEx is and a percent of that that kind of adds to the depreciation base. And I don't want to get into too many details until we are really ready to roll out what the full CapEx plan will be. But there will be some carryover into next year from this year's CapEx plan. And then certainly next year, we are expecting that we will be spending quite a bit more than this year on total CapEx.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. Got it. Thanks for the time this morning.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. So Greg and Adam, happy to join your call. Just some cleanup questions for me. You have covered a lot. The wage incentives, Greg, are they accelerating now? Or are they stabilizing? I just want to get an idea on the environment. Maybe just thoughts on how it's changed through the year?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. We did some things. Ken, if you go back into earlier in the year when we were having issues, we implemented some couple of different bonus plans and incentives, whatever it took to bring the folks on that we needed. But that's moderated, to some degree. We haven't really increased those tied bonuses or incentives, whatever, of late that I am aware of. So I think that's moderated to some degree.\nKen Hoexter: So that's a good sign if you are able to still get people and your incentives are moderating, I guess. The sequential OR commentary. Are there adjustments you worked on to smooth that? Adam, you noted it was a typical 200 to 250 basis points third quarter, fourth quarter. Are there seasonal surcharges you look to add to maybe smooth that out a bit?\nAdam Satterfield: No. There's no surcharges or anything like that. But the fourth quarter, it can be a bit unusual. There are a couple of adjustments to our insurance line. We go through an annual actuarial process in the fourth quarter that can move that insurance line. And there's some other accrual-related items within our benefits program that get looked at by an actuary each year. So there can be some adjustments in the past. We are perfect with our estimates as we move through the year and those are pretty minimal and they haven't been overly material in years past. But for example, last year, when you look at the fourth quarter, the insurance and claims line was only 0.9% and it had been at a run rate of about 1.1%. So a little bit of a favorable adjustment, if you will, there. But absent those types of things, nothing else that really comes in that's different from any other period.\nKen Hoexter: Okay. And then my last one is just you talked a lot about maybe expansion in terms of service centers and adding doors. Anything you want to highlight on productivity gains in terms of turnover per door or any other room for improvement on expanding capacity with the network? Or is that just doing what you are doing to get the 15%, 20% beyond that you need the additional service centers?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't think really anything different to add to it, just we are building up, anticipating what our growth levels are going to be and trying to ensure that we are building up the capacity within the service center network to make sure that not only can we handle the growth that may come at us next year, but still maintain this target of 20% to 25% excess capacity that we like to have in the system. In the LTL world, it's the doors that really can control the amount of freight that can be processed through the system. And so we never want our network to be a limiting factor to our growth. And those service centers are not easy to add and the additions don't come quick either. So you really have to have them out there and it's why it's so important for us to invest even in periods where you might see market softness. The investments that we made in 2016 and 2019, those were critical to be able to accommodate all the growth opportunities that we are seeing in the present. So we just want to make sure that we continue to build out that capacity and just have it there and ready as our customers continue to call on us and want to give us more and more of their freight.\nKen Hoexter: No. I wasn't arguing the need for the additional service centers. I was just wondering if there's anything more you can do to improve productivity on existing centers to gain additional capacity.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean that's just the density and yield breakdown. If we keep on average that 20% to 25%, just say every stick of freight that comes through an average service center is going to drive incremental improvement in the operating ratio to that one particular service center where we may have expanded it two years ago. And then certainly, the yield performance has got to be there to offset the generalized core cost inflation at that service center level as well. So you build that out and scale it across 250 facilities while we may be expanding maybe 15 facilities in any given year or so, you have got a large grouping that have already been expanded, incurred that incremental depreciation. And now we are driving profit improvement at each service center level. So that's really what's driven the overall model is to continue to invest ahead of growth and then that density and yield contribution drives the bottomline growth faster than the top line.\nKen Hoexter: Great, Adam. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yes. As you mentioned earlier, you increased your door count by 50%, while most of the industry was flat or down over the last decade. and clearly, that created a lot of value for your customers, employees and shareholders. I mean as we look over the next five to 10 years, though, it does feel like more of your competitors, though not all of them, are pursuing a growth-oriented approach to the market. I know we have had a lot of questions on capacity. But can you frame how big is big enough for OD, whether in terms of tonnage or market share or service centers, however really you want to measure it? And when do we get to the point as you look forward where that margin benefit of the growth investment starts to decline more noticeably? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: I will take a shot at the first part of your question, Bascome. I am not sure that we really look at it like that, how big is big enough. I think it's all based on where we see our needs and where are they and what do we need to make sure we can service our customers as we have committed to them to do. And I think that's the key. Where does that take us? How big do we become? I don't know. That's not something that we have looked at or focused on. I don't know that that's extremely productive. So I wouldn't say that we have really looked at it that way. But wherever our needs are, we will continue to address them. And down the road, where it takes us? I guess we will just have to wait and see.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for the perspective.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hi. Good morning everyone and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just want to come back to the labor side of things quickly and some of the headcount increases. Can you maybe give us a little color on where those new hires are coming in as far as the breakdown between drivers and dock labor? And then just as a follow-up, Adam, you touched on some of the productivity potential. But if you go through that onboarding process, how long does it typically take for you to get those new hires up to full potential? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Yes. It's the breakdown. Obviously, we have got to have both drivers and our platform employees to move the freight. So pretty consistent balance with our line haul drivers, our pickup and delivery drivers, especially as we have added new service centers, not only just the general growth that the business has had and then the platform employees as well, mainly the productive labor employees that are responsible for moving the freight and handling freight for our customers. So that's driving the majority of that growth in the headcount. And it's been something that, to say your headcount is up 21% essentially is pretty meaningful, especially given all the conversations about labor shortages around the country. So we are certainly proud of how successful we have been, despite the fact that we said we would love to continue to hire more, if you will. And it's just a balance on the productivity. The biggest learning curve happens on the dock for us. You can't get too overly caught up in one particular metric versus another. The most important for us is to make sure that each new employee on the dock understands that their number one priority is to use all the tools and techniques that we have in place to protect our customers' freight. And whether that's the dunnage, the airbags, utilizing the load bars that are in our line haul, trailers, everything that really drives that overall value proposition. The claims management is a big part of that. And we continue to have cargo claims ratio at 0.1% to 0.2%. So that's something that we are really proud of and more motivated that we make sure our employees understand that, that is a part of the value equation. That's part of the piece of our yield management success over the years and a big differentiating factor between us and many of our competitors. So there may be a six-month learning curve in place for people to come on to make sure they are effectively preventing claims and also the other piece of it is maximizing our load factor to ensure that they are utilizing the entire queue. That's our biggest cost element is line haul. And so we want to make sure that they are more focused on those key factors, if you will, versus just the number of shipments per hour that we might manage on the dock. But that gives you the opportunity as those new people are now more seasoned, certainly, that's why we are looking at seeing some of that productivity opportunity as we turn the page into 2022. And certainly, would love to see some improvement as we finish out the balance of the year. But I think that that will be a pretty good opportunity for us to drive some further cost improvement into next year.\nBruce Chan: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Well, thank you all today for your participation. We surely appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and hope you have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, he Old Dominion team produced strong profitable growth that included new company records for quarterly revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2021 was our third straight quarter with double digit revenue growth and the fifth straight quarter of double digit growth in earnings per diluted share. While our revenue results reflect the unprecedented demand for our best-in-class service, our ability to grow at these impressive rates is the result of our long term commitment to consistently invest in capacity. We continue to have available network capacity as well as best-in-class service, both of which are qualities that differentiate us within our industry and provide a distinct competitive advantage for Old Dominion. These qualities have also supported our ability to win market share and produce profitable growth over the long term. With continuing strength in the macroeconomic environment and limited industry capacity, we believe demand for transportation services will continue through the fourth quarter of this year and into 2022. As a result, we expect our business level momentum that began in the third quarter of 2020 will also continue. To take advantage of these opportunities and produce further profitable growth we believe that it will be important for us to continue to execute on the long term strategic plan that we have operated under for many years. This strategy focused on delivering a value proposition of superior service at a fair price to our customers, which generally creates the capital for us to further invest into capacity and technology to support our customer supply chain needs. Our most important investment, however, will continue to be in the OD family of employees. Our people are critical to our success as they work tirelessly each day to provide service value to our customers. We added over 1,000 new full-time employees between June and September of this year. These additions resulted in a 20.9% increase in our average full-time headcount as compared to the third quarter of 2020. While we have grown the OD family this year, the capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support future growth. As a result, we expect that we will continue to add new full-time employees to our team during the fourth quarter and next year. We believe further additions will be necessary to prepare for anticipated growth and to also reduce the use of third-party purchase transportation. We expect to use third-party purchase transportation during the fourth quarter at levels similar to the third quarter. While we would like to reduce this level of utilization, we must continue to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet in support of our topline revenue performance. We hold the third parties that we work with to the same standards of excellence and our team remains fully committed to providing best-in-class service to our customers. Our customers' expectations for excellence do not change, regardless of how we move their freight and given the supply chain challenges that many of them are currently facing, we want them to have complete confidence in our ability to deliver. Old Dominion set the standard in our industry with our ability to provide superior service and service center capacity to support our customers' growth. As a result, we believe we are in a better position than any other carrier to win additional market share and further increase shareholder value over the long term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Yes. The terminal count, Jon, I think we have got another three or four that we expect to open in this calendar year. And we have numerous others that we are working on for next year. I can't give you an exact number but I am going to say, we are in about the eight to 10 range for next year, something like that. So we have got a lot of projects that we were in the middle and then we have got an awful lot on the list to start as we go forward. But just remember, lot of those things, they take time, what's like pulling teeth, if you will, in some cases. But we are working on locations where we need help and where we think we know we could be capacity constrained. So with all that and hope to continue to be able to accomplish whatever, wherever our needs are. Yes. Scott, as I mentioned before, we have had to do some things a little bit different from a pay and benefit standpoint, pay mainly. We look at benefits every year and see where we can make improvements. And we have done that over the course of time. But I don't think we have got to do anything drastically different from a pay standpoint. We did give an annual increase again this past September as we have done in years past. And again, we have had to do referral bonuses and hiring bonuses in those certain locations where we are really challenged to find folks. But I don't think it will be significantly different going forward what we have to do. Like I said before and I have said over the years, we can still get people. We just have to work harder at doing it. And I think we will continue with that focus. We are always looking for ways and different avenues to accomplish whatever the hiring needs that we have are. So we will continue to do that. What was that last question you asked about vaccines? Well, yes, we would love to have some clear line of sight as to just exactly what's coming down the line. I know you have heard the same thing we have heard and there's a mandate supposedly coming. But I am not exactly sure where that is right now. I think you also know that we actually, back about four months ago, we offered our employees an incentive to get vaccinated. And we have had some success with that. As far as the mandate goes, that would be extremely difficult, in my opinion. It's either get vaccinated or do the testing. We are still working on that and trying to figure out how we can accomplish testing the numbers of folks that we would have to test on a weekly basis. Extremely, extremely difficult to accomplish, I don't want to say impossible. But there are some challenges there that I think are going to be very difficult if it comes to that. And God help our industry, if it does. If you think we have got supply chain issues now across the country, that could really throw it into some kind of a crazy tailspin. But we will see where it goes. But hopefully, clear heads will prevail at some point. Confident that the government gets that? No, not at all. I sure hope at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. I know there are some forces in Washington. I think the ATA is working on a couple of different things. And hopefully, we will have some success with that, exempting truckers, whatever the strategy might be. But at some point in time, I think common sense has to prevail. There's a place for that. I am not sure we have used a whole lot of it to this point. But certainly, there is a place for that as it relates to vaccines and mandates and whatnot. I think the other thing is, fortunately, the numbers we are seeing are moving in the right direction. As far as COVID goes, they are really dropping. I saw something on the news this morning where we are down to a 4%-something positivity rate. Maybe that was just for the state of North Carolina, I am not sure. But the numbers do look a lot better than they did back several months ago. So again, I think if you take that into account with where we are as far as the numbers of cases and those kind of things, surely, at some point, common sense will prevail. Hi Jack. Jack, as I mentioned before, I think we are seeing an awful lot of strength right now off of the West Coast. And obviously, all those containers sitting out there, that freight has got to move in, at some point. And I think that's why we are seeing the small increase in our length of haul. I don't know that there's anything else that would contribute to that. Yes. We did some things. Ken, if you go back into earlier in the year when we were having issues, we implemented some couple of different bonus plans and incentives, whatever it took to bring the folks on that we needed. But that's moderated, to some degree. We haven't really increased those tied bonuses or incentives, whatever, of late that I am aware of. So I think that's moderated to some degree. I will take a shot at the first part of your question, Bascome. I am not sure that we really look at it like that, how big is big enough. I think it's all based on where we see our needs and where are they and what do we need to make sure we can service our customers as we have committed to them to do. And I think that's the key. Where does that take us? How big do we become? I don't know. That's not something that we have looked at or focused on. I don't know that that's extremely productive. So I wouldn't say that we have really looked at it that way. But wherever our needs are, we will continue to address them. And down the road, where it takes us? I guess we will just have to wait and see. Yes. It's the breakdown. Obviously, we have got to have both drivers and our platform employees to move the freight. So pretty consistent balance with our line haul drivers, our pickup and delivery drivers, especially as we have added new service centers, not only just the general growth that the business has had and then the platform employees as well, mainly the productive labor employees that are responsible for moving the freight and handling freight for our customers. So that's driving the majority of that growth in the headcount. And it's been something that, to say your headcount is up 21% essentially is pretty meaningful, especially given all the conversations about labor shortages around the country. So we are certainly proud of how successful we have been, despite the fact that we said we would love to continue to hire more, if you will. And it's just a balance on the productivity. The biggest learning curve happens on the dock for us. You can't get too overly caught up in one particular metric versus another. The most important for us is to make sure that each new employee on the dock understands that their number one priority is to use all the tools and techniques that we have in place to protect our customers' freight. And whether that's the dunnage, the airbags, utilizing the load bars that are in our line haul, trailers, everything that really drives that overall value proposition. The claims management is a big part of that. And we continue to have cargo claims ratio at 0.1% to 0.2%. So that's something that we are really proud of and more motivated that we make sure our employees understand that, that is a part of the value equation. That's part of the piece of our yield management success over the years and a big differentiating factor between us and many of our competitors. So there may be a six-month learning curve in place for people to come on to make sure they are effectively preventing claims and also the other piece of it is maximizing our load factor to ensure that they are utilizing the entire queue. That's our biggest cost element is line haul. And so we want to make sure that they are more focused on those key factors, if you will, versus just the number of shipments per hour that we might manage on the dock. But that gives you the opportunity as those new people are now more seasoned, certainly, that's why we are looking at seeing some of that productivity opportunity as we turn the page into 2022. And certainly, would love to see some improvement as we finish out the balance of the year. But I think that that will be a pretty good opportunity for us to drive some further cost improvement into next year. Well, thank you all today for your participation. We surely appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and hope you have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's (revenue grew 32.3% in the third quarter to $1.4 billion and our operating ratio improved to 72.6%. The combination of these changes led to a 44.4% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.47 for the quarter. Our revenue growth was balanced between LTL volumes and yield, both of which were supported by the strong domestic economy and capacity issues within the industry. Our LTL funds increased 13.7% and LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 15.7%, which also reflects the impact on our fuel surcharge program from the increase in diesel fuel prices. Excluding fuel surcharges, LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.1% as a result of the continued success with our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. On a sequential basis, third quarter LTL shipments per day increased 3.2% over the second quarter 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 2.9%. LTL tons per day increased 1.0% as compared to the 10-year average sequential increase of 1.9%. These 10- average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for a more normalized comparison. At this point in October, with only a few work days remaining in the month our revenue per day has increase by approximately 33% to 35% when compared to October 2020. We will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the third quarter improved 190 basis points to 72.6% as a result of the operating leverage created by our revenue growth as well as our continued focus on operation efficiency. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 200 basis points, due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. As a percent of revenue, salaries, wages and benefits improved 320 basis points between the periods compared. Our productive labor cost within this expense category improved 200 basis points which more than offset the 130 basis point increase in purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $364.3 million and $872.6 million for the third quarter and first nine months of 2021, respectively, while capital expenditures were $178.69 and $384.7 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $565 million for this year. The $40 million decrease from our prior estimate is mainly due to the timing on large real estate projects that will be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about 2022 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release, but at this time we expect to increase our expenditures to support our ongoing market share initiatives and to reduce the average age of our fleet. We continued to return capital to shareholders during the third quarter through our dividend and share repurchase programs, including the $250 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that will expire no later than March 2022. For the first nine months of this year, the cash utilized for shareholder return programs included $599 million for share repurchases and $69.4 million of cash dividends. Effective tax rate for the third quarter 2021 was 25.2% as compared 24.8% in the third quarter 2020. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open for the floor for questions at this time. Sure. One of the things driving the change in shipments versus tonnage for as well to point out is the fact that we continue to have a little bit lower wait for shipment rather. And that's the change that we talked about in recent quarters as we continue to focus on more traditional LTL shipments and try to work out some of these larger, harder to handle type of shipments that are more transactional in nature generally within our system. So that had a little bit of an impact overall and that discrepancy, if you will, between the tons and the shipments. When we look at shipments, they were on a sequential basis just above what the 10-year trend would have been at 3.2% versus the 2.92%, a little discrepancy there. But back to the point of your question, when we look at really the volumes in general but tonnage and shipments as we work through the quarter, we were right in line with normal sequential trends in July versus June but then had a pretty big step back in August. Our tons per day in August, decreased 1.6% from July. The 10-year average changes is 0.5% increase there. And a big reason for that was the fact that we started seeing across the country the rise in COVID cases and just the ongoing labor issues that are affecting many customers and warehouses throughout the country. That certainly had an effect on business directly and indirectly, really. So that was an issue that caused us, in some cases, to not be able to pickup freight when we couldn't be able to deliver it And so there was certainly a ripple effect, I think, throughout the economy and reflected in our business results as well. But as cases started to improve, some of that pickup back in the labor participation rates, we saw significant recovery. Really, it began towards the end of August but really accelerated through the month of September, such that our tons per day in September were up 5.2% over August versus the 10-year average change of 3.7%. So it certainly made up for that and so as we accelerated through the end of the quarter. Sure. Well, Greg mentioned in our prepared remarks, we will continue to focus on bringing on new employees as we go through the fourth quarter. And it's something that frankly we have been doing all year. If you look at the change in our volumes and change in people, we have exceeded what our normal sequential trends have been, I think, for five straight quarters. So that's something that we think will continue given the strength of the demand environment that we certainly feel very confident that that will extend into the 2022. So it's important for us to continue to really build up all the elements of capacity that we need in our business and that people, fleet and the service center side to be able to accommodate our customers' expectations for growth and to be able to continue to deliver best-in-class service to them. With that said, I still feel good about the performance in the third quarter. We were pretty much right in line to sequential operating ratio performance, it was right in line with normal trends. And that factored in a lot of calls that are coming onboard. We still face some of those cost challenges. But we would expect to be right in line with what our normal sequential change is from 3Q to 4Q. And that's typically in the 200 to 250 basis point increase from the third quarter. I think that we should be able to be in that range while we will have some calls continuing to come at as, both in relation to the investment in new employees. We are still taking delivery on some equipment. So we have got some cost pressures there. But we have still got incredible topline revenue performance that's helping to offset those and certainly yield performance has continued to be strong. But as you alluded to, with the change in our volumes and overall revenue for October, we are performing well above what the normal sequential trends would otherwise be on the volume inside and pricing strength is certainly continuing as well. Yes. Jordan, I think it will continue to tract, to some extent. But you have got to remember, ewe have really chasing it for the most part all year. As our growth has accelerated, we continue to chase our needs and continue to play catch-up to some degree. But I do think that we will start to moderate and level back out to more normal type pace going forward. At least that's what we hope. Yes. We have done the same thing this year that we have done in years past. We gave our annual rate in September and in some cases we have had to increase starting wages. We have had some places where we have had referral bonuses and those kind of things. So we have had lock-up matching in quarters past. We are having success. We just have to work a little harder at it and do things a little bit differently, whatever it takes to get the folks onboard. But you were having success and I expect we will continue to do so. Ravi, we are still at about 15% to 20% excess capacity and that's in the service center network which is the most important in the LTL businessman. I mean it certainly takes people in trucks but that's the longest term form of capacity and the hardest to put in place. And we have been consistent with our investments over the years and we will continue on that front as we finish out this year and then transitions into next year. But that's about at the same point that we were when we finished last quarter as well. So despite the strong sequential volume performance that we had in 3Q, we have been able to keep that excess capacity level at about the same spot. So we are going to keep after it and keep adding to those capacity levels. And certainly, as Greg mentioned, we have got to really continue to be focused in the short term on continuing to add people into the mix. And that's probably been in our biggest need all year as we work through the balance of the year. But it really takes all three forms. And we came into this year, we don't really know exactly what our competitors' strategies are but we came into this year believing that we had more capacity than anyone. And that really goes back to our 10-year investment that we have made. We have expanded our door count by over 50% over the last 10 years. We have seen very little investment from some of the others, maybe a service center here and there but nothing at any major scale. And so that has created an environment for us to be able to win more market share than anyone else. And certainly, we believe we still got best-in-class service. So we have got a service advantage in the marketplace and we have got more capacity than anyone else. And that gives us the capacity advantage in the marketplace and that usually produces pretty phenomenal results when we get into the strong demand periods like we have been in this year and what we expect to see for next year as well. So it gives us a lot of confidence to say, we are the best positioned carrier to continue to produce profitable growth and increase shareholder value, even from the levels from which we are currently operating. We think we are going to get what we have asked for. At this point in time, there is no indication that we will not. So we will have to wait and see, obviously, but so far the outlook for a truck standpoint is good. Yes. We certainly start out, I mean we are covering all markets today. So when we open a new facility, it already starts with a good book of business, if you will and is pretty much profitable immediately. And so that also frees up some capacity in the existing service center that we move ZIP Codes and freight out of into the new location. So that's been part of our expansion process over the years and certainly we have invested a lot of dollars in expanding our network and that 50% increase in door count that I talked about earlier. But that kind of all goes into it and it's why when we talk about our yield management philosophy that we focus on getting an increase every year in our revenue per shipment to exceed what our cost per shipment inflation will be, but also to support the continued investment in our service center network. And as supply chains become more sophisticated, customers are leveraging our network to their benefits as we are processing freight through our network of about 250 service center today. So it's something that we are effectively purchasing real estate capacity on behalf of our customers and we want to be only that's really making the type of material investments that we have. So it's important for us to continue to keep that within the context of yield management so that we can afford these service centers that are becoming more and more expensive as we are competing with different parties to go out and find the real estate to continue to support our growth. But certainly, we have had great success in the past. We got a good team detail that's always trying to stay ahead of the growth curve and at the levels where we are, we feel like we have got us probably stay a little bit further ahead of the curve than we have had in years past. But we have got a good plan. We got a list of about 35 to 40 service centers that we think we want to add to the network in due time and probably won't stop there.. We feel like we have got a very long runway for growth ahead of us, given what our expectations for growth in the industry, given the consolidation in the industry and general lack of investment by the carriers it's certainly a great spot for us to be in to continue to be in a good position to win market share. Yes, sir. I don't know if we are immune to anything that's going on in the marketplace. But, Tom, we do see continued strength off the West Coast. I mean obviously there is a lot of stuff sitting out there in the water and as it continues to get into the warehouses and whatnot, we are seeing and feeling that strength in those markets. But certainly, was not immune to anything. And any change or any change of strategy or whatever by our suppliers or our customers will change some of the things that we have to do and possibly where the freight comes to, goes from, whatever. But right now, we adjust as is necessary. And so far, I would say, the impact has been somewhat minimal, if you will. Again, not immune to anything that's going on, but not a huge impact. We don't want to give any specific guidance per se. But the balance of the revenue growth in October is pretty consistent, pretty split evenly between yield and tonnage like it was in the third quarter. Those two numbers were pretty close. On the yield side, obviously recently fuel prices have continued to increase, so that overall revenue per hundredweight metric will continue to reflect that number. But again, we are still seeing considerable strength on the volume side as well. Certainly, as we go through the period we think about the comparisons, the comparisons certainly get a little tougher each month as we work through the fourth quarter. It was last year, our volumes were accelerating month after month, such that the third quarter was a bit of really strong outperformance versus what our normal trends have been. Typically, we see strong performance for five or six quarters like that and then kind of revert to normal sequential trends which, by the way, reflect a whole lot of market share gain over the past 10 years. When you think about our shipments per day, they are averaging about 50% increase versus where we were 10 years ago. So there is a lot of market share gains that are in those numbers. But overall, I think if you just were to say that we operate on d normal sequential trends, that us with some pretty strong numbers on the volume side next year. And we don't want to say that's what the forecast is. But right now, we haven't seen any letdown with respect to demand. So it's hard to call that we are going to see any slowdown. And certainly based on customer conversations and everything that we see and read, we feel like this unprecedented level of demand that we have seen this year will continue into next year, especially if other carriers are continuing to be capacity constrained. That certainly could continue to just push more and more volumes our way. And so, we just got to be in a c position to continue to bring it onboard and make sure we are focused on profitable growth, which is what our long term focus has been and continue to take care of our customers in offering them solutions in various ways, be it handling all their LTL shipments, using out truckload brokerage division to help them out with any truckload moves as that's put and then the grades division that we have in our non-LTL as well which is mainly focused in the Southeast is seeing a lot of strength there. So it all comes back to building a relationship with your customer and trying to continue to serve them as best you can. And we are going to continue with that focus as we transition into 2022, but not keeping our eye off the ball with respect to the fourth quarter as well. We still got a lot of work to do to finish out this year with strength. Fair. Yes, sir. We still got to try to reduce this purchase transportation. We like to get back to managing the business completely in source from a line haul standpoint. And that's what we have done in the past and we are using it to supplement the team right now, again just getting back to being able to serve our customers. But certainly that's the focus. And it will take our headcount exceeding our shipment count. Over the long term, those two numbers are really aligned, the change in headcount, the change in shipments. But we have got to catch back up with things and we have been under the shipment growth, if you will, for the past year and year-and-a-half. And so it's going to take a period to sort of regain that to not only catch up with our business overall but really to be anticipating the growth that we are likely see next year. Good morning Scott. I think that's something that we just got to continue to work at. When you look over the past two years, the improvement that we have had in the operating ratio, the two-year performance really has only been exceeded by the two-year performance back in 2010, 2011, coming out of the depths of the recession. So we are really proud of what we have achieved over the last few years and we feel confident to say that we know we have got room for further improvement. I think we will wait until we get to the fourth quarter to really start talking about kind of what our next target will be. But again, if you look over the long term, we have averaged 100 to 150 basis point improvement in the operating ratio each year and that's sort of gets back to that delta between our revenue and cost per shipment. So a lot go into each of those two numbers, us managing our cost and continuing to focus on productivity and offsetting all the cost that go along with expanding our model. And that creates some short term cost headwinds but when you look at the long term performance for what we have done over the past 10 years, producing an average of 10% to 11% change in revenue each year and about 25% average annual increase in our EPs, that's driven considerable share value over that 10 year period and we want to continue to do that as we look out into the next 10 year horizon as well. So certainly a lot of opportunity, but of a lot of hard work and focus on execution on our part to make it happen. Sure. One, we have said this before, but we don't manage the company to the incremental margin. That's just the calculation of all the work that we do in sort of building out the balancing the revenue growth and margin improvement opportunities. We had used that long term target of 25% really as an inverse to say we were working towards a 75% operating ratio goal. And that's really more of what we talk about within the company for where we think we can take the operating ratio. So I think we will give a little bit more color on that when we get to our fourth quarter call. Obviously, based on kind of what I mentioned earlier about the target for the fourth quarter, that puts us at an annual operating ratio somewhere around 74%. So it certainly looks like we will be able to beat that 75% OR target this year. And as it comes down to incremental margins, I think this will go down as our biggest incremental margin year in our history. And when we have talked about the cost structure with you before, we have laid out kind of the cost structure as balanced between our variable and fixed costs and how we can operate at a 35% to 40% incremental margin in a particular quarter in a short period of time. But we don't want to get overly fixated on incremental margins because, again, we are focusing on the investments that are required to drive long term growth. We don't measure the success of our business based on how strong an incremental can be. It's really some of those longer term numbers that I referenced earlier. And we want to be able to repeat that because we think there's a lot of growth opportunity left within our business. And so that's going to be the focus. But it requires investment and that can create some short term headwinds. And if that's the only lens that you look at things through, you miss out on a ton of opportunity to drive shareholder value. And so we are going to keep that long term focus, continue to make al the necessary investments. And if that drives the incremental down a little bit, one, I am pretty pleased with 33%. I don't think that's anything to sneeze at for the quarter and producing a very strong 72.6% operating ratio. But based on that cost structure breakdown, we feel confident in saying that we certainly can drive the operating ratio meaningfully lower. And whenever we get to whatever that next threshold might be, we will continue to look at managing the business and how the algorithm works. And it's not to say that whatever the next stopping point will be the final stopping point. We think that there's a lot of opportunity left here. So we will keep marching forward. The algorithm certainly has worked for us in the past and we think can continue to work for us into the future. Yes. If you go back to the first quarter of this year, we were still at sort of a 1,600-pound range average. That dropped to 1,570 in the second quarter. And so I feel like we are probably likely to settle in this 1,550-pound range, kind of plus or minus 20 pounds or so. And so we will still have a little bit of a drag, if you want to call it that, with the first quarter comparison. But by 2Q, you should start to see that of next year more normalize and see the shipment and tonnage performance more comparable with one another. Well, I think for the industry, if we continue to see this supply and demand imbalance, in the past, many of the carriers that are out of capacity certainly use the environment to push prices meaningfully higher and try to take advantage and improve the margin. So certainly, that type of environment is supportive of our pricing initiatives. For us, it's more of a long term consistent approach and one that we think is fair but equitable. It's one that we can sit down with our customers and talk about what our cost inflation is and what our needs are in terms of reinvesting in the business to either improve customer service or investing in ways that ultimately are going to reduce cost. So it's a win-win situation for both us and our customers. And so we try to target our cost inflation and then some and we have been pretty successful with that. And so that will continue to be the focus.  But with that said, we are always focusing on the individual account profitability. And so when you are in these types of environments, there are some accounts that their operating ratios are not as good as others. And those are the types of accounts that really over the last couple of years that we have had to address some issues and there's different ways to improve yield. It's not always through price. And so that's where you sit down and you build on your relationship together and work through different initiatives that ultimately can create the same results of yield improvement there. So certainly, given the expectation that the demand trends will remain very strong and given the lack of capacity that we believe is in the industry and that's mainly grounded in the feedback that we are getting from customers, we certainly expect there to be a strong pricing environment for the industry next year, for which we will be able to benefit. Well, I think that, one, the topline performance certainly helps offset a lot of cost. And we will see how the rest of the quarter shapes up, if you will. But typically, we see a little bit of softness, if you will, just about 0.5% to 1% drop in our revenue per day performance from 3Q to 4Q. And so based on the current performance, we are definitely outperforming October, if you will. So we will see where that puts us for the end of the quarter. But we are doing a lot of things with respect to managing costs. We talk a lot about the labor cost and that's probably 65% of total cost in our salary, wages and benefits line. And we have seen a lot of productivity this year, especially within our line haul and our pickup delivery operations. We have lost some productivity on the dock. So I think that the fourth quarter and the first quarter, that will be some opportunity that we continue to focus on. It's not that we haven't been focused on it. But I think that that's something that will help on the labor front if we can reduce the levels of purchase transportation and manage more freight with our people and our equipment. Certainly think that that will be beneficial as well, given the rates that we are having to pay. And we are using about the same level in October as we were in the third quarter. We hope that we will be able to reduce that level of utilization a little bit. But at this point, the topline trends have dictated all year. I think every quarterly call, we have had for the last four quarters, we have talked about wanting to be able to reduce that expense category. But the topline trends have really dictated that continued utilization. So we will see where that balances out. But there's just a lot of cost management that is here within the business and that we are focused on as well as continuing to see that strong topline performance that will help offset some of this inflation as we are bringing on new people. We will continue to see our benefit costs in the third quarter were higher and expect that that will likely continue as we are continuing to balance out the number of hours worked by our employees. As we increase that workforce, there's certainly going to be more incremental benefit costs that will be incurred. But we feel good about all the other contributing factors to help offset some of that cost inflation. Yes. Certainly, we have seen the equipment deliveries delayed a little bit this year. We haven't finished completely with the delivery cycle at this point. But we do expect that all units ordered will be delivered to us and we have already had preliminary conversations with our OEMs about next year as well. And as Greg mentioned, we believe we will get all of the equipment that we need to be able to manage the growth that we are anticipating. But that has resulted in some depreciation that's kind of come in, in different periods. that too will be something that we are only about 80% through September complete with the CapEx order on the equipment. There will be some deliveries that we are taking here in the fourth quarter that will add to that depreciation base and then that will trend up as we go into 2022. But typically, you look at kind of the long term trends, there's a pretty consistent factor of what our CapEx is and a percent of that that kind of adds to the depreciation base. And I don't want to get into too many details until we are really ready to roll out what the full CapEx plan will be. But there will be some carryover into next year from this year's CapEx plan. And then certainly next year, we are expecting that we will be spending quite a bit more than this year on total CapEx. No. There's no surcharges or anything like that. But the fourth quarter, it can be a bit unusual. There are a couple of adjustments to our insurance line. We go through an annual actuarial process in the fourth quarter that can move that insurance line. And there's some other accrual-related items within our benefits program that get looked at by an actuary each year. So there can be some adjustments in the past. We are perfect with our estimates as we move through the year and those are pretty minimal and they haven't been overly material in years past. But for example, last year, when you look at the fourth quarter, the insurance and claims line was only 0.9% and it had been at a run rate of about 1.1%. So a little bit of a favorable adjustment, if you will, there. But absent those types of things, nothing else that really comes in that's different from any other period. I don't think really anything different to add to it, just we are building up, anticipating what our growth levels are going to be and trying to ensure that we are building up the capacity within the service center network to make sure that not only can we handle the growth that may come at us next year, but still maintain this target of 20% to 25% excess capacity that we like to have in the system. In the LTL world, it's the doors that really can control the amount of freight that can be processed through the system. And so we never want our network to be a limiting factor to our growth. And those service centers are not easy to add and the additions don't come quick either. So you really have to have them out there and it's why it's so important for us to invest even in periods where you might see market softness. The investments that we made in 2016 and 2019, those were critical to be able to accommodate all the growth opportunities that we are seeing in the present. So we just want to make sure that we continue to build out that capacity and just have it there and ready as our customers continue to call on us and want to give us more and more of their freight. Well, I mean that's just the density and yield breakdown. If we keep on average that 20% to 25%, just say every stick of freight that comes through an average service center is going to drive incremental improvement in the operating ratio to that one particular service center where we may have expanded it two years ago. And then certainly, the yield performance has got to be there to offset the generalized core cost inflation at that service center level as well. So you build that out and scale it across 250 facilities while we may be expanding maybe 15 facilities in any given year or so, you have got a large grouping that have already been expanded, incurred that incremental depreciation. And now we are driving profit improvement at each service center level. So that's really what's driven the overall model is to continue to invest ahead of growth and then that density and yield contribution drives the bottomline growth faster than the top line."

Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you, good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team produced another record breaking quarter and established new company records for quarterly revenues, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. While the comparison of our numbers with the second quarter of 2020 is somewhat skewed due to the impact of the pandemic related shutdowns last year, our second quarter business momentum this year helped to drive the improvement in our revenue and profitability. Our revenue grew 47.2% to $1.3 billion and our operating ratio improved 550 basis points to 72.3%. As a result, our earnings per diluted share grew 84.8% to $2.31. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has guided us through many economic cycles and it is currently driving impressive growth in this strong market. Two key elements of this plan are delivering superior service at a fair price and consistently investing in capacity to help ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We often discussed our unwavering commitment to providing our customers with superior service. This quarter, I would like to offer a deeper dive into how we think about capacity given its relevance to the current environment. There are three major elements of capacity within LTL, doors at our service center, our equipment and our people. Doors can be the most limiting form of capacity in the short-term, which is why we try to stay several years ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We have invested $1.7 billion in our service center network over the past 10 years, which has allowed us to expand our door count by over 50%. Our current capital expenditure plan includes $275 million to further expand the capacity of our service center network, but we are willing to spend even more if we identify properties that are included in our long-term plan. Our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network is important regardless of the macroeconomic environment due to the strong returns on capital for our business. We have consistently invested in the Old Dominion's expansion even in years when our market share trends have been flattish. Due to the confidence we have in our long-term market share potential, although expanding the capacity of service centers takes a significant amount of time, demand trends can change very quickly in our industry, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a large capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes most apparent to shippers and tight environments like this year. We estimate that we currently have 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open several new facilities during the second half of this year. As a result, the capacity of our overall service in our network is in good shape. Although we continue to focus on the needs of certain locations to help ensure, we are keeping up with increased opportunities for growth. We are prepared to address these needs as well as any other elements of capacity that need to be expanded, as it appears that current demand trends will continue into 2022. We believe the domestic economy is strengthening for both our industrial and retail related customers and we expect additional growth in volumes based on current economic forecast as well as customer feedback. We also continue to see accelerating trends with our revenue. We have exceeded a normal sequential trend for each quarter since the cliff event that affected the second quarter of 2020. This outperformance has continued with our month-to-date revenue for July 2021 as well. While we feel good about our service center network, we have faced challenges with the other elements of capacity this year. There've been some delays with equipment deliveries that have caused us to continue to operate older units that were intended to be replaced. We're fortunate to have this as an option due to the fact that we are one of the youngest fleets in our industry. While our suppliers are somewhat behind schedule, we do believe that we will receive each unit that we have ordered this year. These new units will supplement our current pool of equipment and are expected to satisfy our equipment needs through the second half of this year. The capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support ongoing growth. We were successful during the second quarter with our hiring efforts and actually exceeded our goal for the period. We added over 1,100 full-time employees between March and June, and we expect to add another 1,000 full-time employees during the third quarter of this year. We will continue to use third party purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet until those two elements of capacity catch up with the growth in our volumes. Regardless of whether it is our employees and equipment or a third-party moving the freight, we remain focused on providing best-in-class service to our customers. As I previously said, providing superior service at a fair price and having capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve are two key pillars to our long-term strategic plan. The centerpiece of our plan though remains our people. Our OD Family of employees is committed to servicing our customers, while also growing our business. As a result, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to take advantage of the opportunity for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value over the long-term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.3% reflecting success of our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. While the growth in our revenue and volumes reflects an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2020, the sequential acceleration in our revenue during the second quarter was once again well above normal sequential trends. On a sequential basis second quarter LTL shipments per day increased 12.1% over the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.6%. LTL tons per day increased 9.7% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for more normalized comparison. While both our shipments and tons outperformed our long-term averages, the discrepancy between our shipment and tonnage trends as a result of the decrease in our LTL weight per shipment. We have made operational changes over the past few quarters, mainly through pricing actions to limit the number of heavy weighted and larger harder-to-handle types of shipments in our network that are typically more transactional in nature. We increase these efforts during the second quarter, given the ongoing tightness in our industry to preserve capacity for our customers, traditional LTL shipments. At this point in July with only a few days remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 35% when compared to July 2020. The year-over-year revenue comparison gets tougher for us in the third quarter, as our revenue per day turned positive in August 2020 and increased overall for the third quarter of 2020. We will provide actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 550 basis points to a company record 72.3% with improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. This improvement was essentially in line with the target we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Overhead related costs as a percent of revenue improved 490 basis points due primarily to the operating leverage created by the quality of our revenue growth. Much of the overall improvement in overhead as a percent of revenue related to our depreciation and wage and benefit costs for ourselves and administrative employees. Within our direct operating costs, the wage and benefit cost for our driver's, platform employees and fleet technicians improved due primarily to an improvement in the overall efficiency of our operations. This improvement more than offset the increases in operating supplies and expenses, which reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products, as well as the increased utilization of purchase transportation to supplement our workforce. While we will continue to add employees during the second half of this year to support our anticipated growth, we believe we can effectively balance our direct operating cost with revenue as we continue to focus on productivity and ultimately reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $198 million and $508.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021 respectively, while capital expenditures were $155.1 million and $206.1 million for the same periods. We returned $63.2 million of capital to share folders during the second quarter and utilize $395.4 million of cash through the first half of this year for both our dividend and share repurchase programs. This year-to-date total for share repurchases include $68.8 million that is deferred until the third quarter when the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our outstanding stock. We intend to fund this program with cash flows from operations and existing cash to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our first priority for capital spending, however, will continue to be strategic investments in capital expenditures to support the long-term profitable growth of our business. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26% as compared to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020, and we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third floor. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay, Greg, good morning, and Greg, Adam, congrats on a great quarter.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Jack.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Atkins: So, I guess, first question, Adam, could you talk about \u2013 you've referenced the July revenue per day being up 35%. How does that compare relative to normal seasonality, you know, from what Greg was saying, it sounds like that's what you're trending above normal seasonality. And then when we think about the operating ratio given we're seeing inflationary cost pressures across the supply chain. You guys are talking about hiring an additional thousand folks in the third quarter. How should we think about operating ratio trends in the third quarter versus the 2Q relative to the normal seasonality, which I think calls for some very modest degradation if I'm thinking about that right?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes, on the revenue per day basis, obviously, we've still got a few important days to close out the month, but we're trending very favorably at this point for the month of July. And our revenue per day at this point is a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential trends would indicate and it really just follows the pattern that we've seen over the last four quarters that we've referenced. We've exceeded normal sequential trends on a quarterly basis, and really see no reason at this point why that would change as we go into the third quarter. It's \u2013 the market continues to be really tight, the feedback that we're getting from customers. We just continue to see the service advantage and capacity advantage that we have in the marketplace is winning share for us. And so, we're trying to do all the things as we referenced in our prepared remarks to continue to prepare for further growth and to provide best-in-class service to our customers. So we'll continue to do all those elements to get prepared. And as we get through the balance of this year and really continue to try to position the company for 2022. With respect to the margin question, we typically see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter. And I think that we'll see somewhere in that same ballpark 50 to 70 basis points maybe, so kind of flattish as we go from the second quarter, are consider that flattish. But just a slight increase we typically see and have our wage increase is effective the 1st of September. We're a little behind schedule on some of our equipment deliveries as Greg mentioned as well. So that means that we'll have a little bit more depreciation hitting us in the third quarter than typically where it would have been loaded into the first half of the year. So a few factors like that that may come on board, but certainly continuing to see strength as we work our way into the third quarter.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's all very helpful, Adam. Thank you. And I guess maybe for my second question, more of a bigger picture, longer-term question, but there are a lot of just concerns among investors with sustainability of the freight market and trends and obviously you guys are expecting the current strength in the market to continue well into 2022, if I'm quoting you correctly. But the investments you're making in your business should position you to take market share. And I think when you look at the market more broadly, how are you thinking about secular growth within LTL, given its leverage, increasing leverage to e-commerce and the importance of e-commerce middle-mile e-commerce demand to overall LTL growth over the next several years. Could you maybe talk about that for a moment, Greg? Because it seems like that's something that could really lift a tonnage in the broader LTL industry and you guys are in a great position to capitalize on that.\nGreg Gantt: Sure, Jack. No question about it. I mean, the e-commerce has continued to grow as everybody knows and we've benefited from that as well as some of our competitors, but it's strong. I'm not sure I see any change in that if anything continued growth especially with changes that we've had with the COVID and how people continue to stay at home and work from home and those kinds of things. I think that have continued to drive some of the e-commerce and the middle-mile business that we've enjoyed in the last period of time \u2013 over the last period of time, so definitely strong, getting stronger. And I think, like I mentioned before, with all the investments that we continue to make and positioning ourselves to have capacity and to be able to do the things that some of our competitors can't because of it, I think we're in a good position, Jack.\nJack Atkins: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning everybody. Greg, kind of continuing on that theme, if my notes are correct, last quarter, you said you had about 25% to 30% excess capacity in your network for growth and today you said 15% to 20%. Are you pushing up against the limits of where you're more actively going out to try to take share to keep around that 15% kind of a just in case excess capacity? Or do you still feel that you could be more aggressive as it goes out with pricing and trying to take share in the back half of the year?\nGreg Gantt: So, I can tell you, we won't be aggressive and take share with price. We've never, we've never used that strategy and certainly don't intend to do that in this market that we're in today. As you know we're extremely busy as \u2013 the 47% growth, that type of growth, it does take capacity out of your network pretty darn quick, but I will say this we've got some nine \u2013 if I looked at it correctly, we've got nine facilities that we're trying to open in the back half of this year. I'm not sure we'll get all nine of them open, but we will get several of them between now and the end of the year and the other should come early in the 2022. And we have some 1 dozen or 12 service centers where we're adding doors, we're adding door capacity. So, we're working on continuing to grow our capacity just as quickly as we can. And besides that, those are just the projects that are underway that's not counting all the funds that we're trying to accomplish with land purchases and those kinds of things. So we're working to grow it as we speak. It's an ongoing effort. Again, this business that we're facing today, it takes it out pretty darn quick, sometimes it takes it out quicker than you put it back, but we are working on it, like I said, as we speak.\nJon Chappell: Okay. And to be clear, I wasn't insinuating you'd be taking share with price. I was hoping that you'd be taking share with capacity and then pricing as efficiently as you have been. Just as the follow-up for Adam. Once again going back to April, you would insinuated that PT hopefully would be down in 2Q, but most likely wouldn't be and it really wasn't, but really expecting it to come down in second half. I know you look at it holistically with wage and benefits as well, and you're adding a thousand people in the third quarter. Is it still likely that PT can come down on a meaningful basis in second half? Or given that capacity shrink and maybe some issues with hiring we should think about PT being maybe a bit more inflated than usual in the second half of the year.\nGreg Gantt: Yes, I think for the third quarter especially that it's going to stay at an elevated amount, we actually use quite a bit more in the month of June as we've worked through the end of the quarter strength that we typically see there. We actually had to step up our utilization of it somewhat and we expect it to be actually probably a little bit higher in the third quarter than the 3.3% that we used in 2Q. But I think that as we continue to be successful with bringing people on board that we'll be in the position to hopefully through the fourth quarter and as we transition in 1Q of next year to be able to increasingly use our people and our equipment and reduce that reliance. But because of the strength of the top-line, we just had to continue to pull that lever of using the purchase transportation to continue to serve our customers. And so that's certainly something that we can continue to do through the third quarter and \u2013 but ultimately as you know our strategy is to try to have everything in-source from a domestic line haul standpoint and that's where we ultimately want to get back to. So it's just because of the strength of the top-line. We've had to use it a little bit longer through the year than we had originally intended.\nJon Chappell: All right, well, it's a good problem to have. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Gantt: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hi, Greg. Hi, Adam. Good morning gentlemen. I wanted to touch a little bit on freight selectivity in any accessorial charges because one of your competitors who had reported really noted that that helped them out in the quarter. I got a sense that maybe their accessorial charges were sort of not up to market. But just curious, how much do you think that gave you a boost in the quarter and on freight selectivity how much of that is permanent versus just depending upon the market itself?\nGreg Gantt: Jason, I don't know that we necessarily any competitors actions in terms of new accessorials or changes in accessorials necessarily impacts us, obviously when the pricing environment is strong like it is right now that provides a lift to everyone and supports our own pricing initiatives. But I think we have a differentiated approach to pricing and we've seen that and it's really been the foundation for why we produce such long-term profitable growth. We have a strategy of looking at our cost inflation and then we try to target increases in our revenue per shipment to give us a cost plus pricing. And that formulates the approach every year goes into our general rate increase when we push that out, that goes into what we try to achieve from a contract renewal standpoint as well. With that said each account must stand on its own from an individual profitability standpoint. And so we would look at each account on an individual basis and what the cost inputs are for that particular account and what our pricing needs to look like to provide an appropriate return for us. And I think we've got really good consistency across our book of business. I think we saw that last year in the disruption in particular, in the second quarter when a large percentage of our business shifted to larger national accounts. And I think there was a concern by some on the street about what that would do to margins. And we went through the second quarter of last year with a 15% decrease in revenue, a change in mix of our business, but we were able to still improve our operating ratio with the pricing actions and the cost control measures that we had in place as well. So we're going to stick to our long-term consistent approach and continue to push for cost plus pricing because it's important for us to continue to expand our capacity. We're one of the few carriers that that really has invested over the long-term. As Greg mentioned this morning, we've invested and expanded our door count over the last 10 years by over 50%. And that supported about a 50% improvement in shipments per day over that same timeframe. So we're uniquely positioned to continue to gain share in a market that that continues to somewhat at least from the reports we get on the public carriers, the number of service centers over that 10 year period have stayed about the same or reduced slightly. So it's a good spot for us to being and to continue to take advantage of opportunity. Certainly, we're going to do it with price, but we should see the volumes come through and improve density as well. And as you know that density and yield formula produces long-term improvement in our operating ratio. And so, we've got further room to improve from where we are today.\nJason Seidl: Well, you guys have clearly been the best at that density and yield formula over my career. I wanted to get back to the excess capacity. And you said obviously 15% to 20% is in the network right now that obviously doesn't include any of the nine facilities that you're targeting to add in back half of the year. If we look on a historic basis, sort of what's the lowest that number has ever been in terms of excess capacity?\nGreg Gantt: Oh gosh, Jason, I am \u2013 you'd have to go way back. I think there was maybe a point in time and I'm going way back some 20 plus years when we probably had very little capacity. But if you \u2013 I don't know how long you followed us exactly, But\u2026\nJason Seidl: 22 years.\nGreg Gantt: 22, well, that's probably about when we really ramp it up, really it was in the early 2000s. We really ramped up our efforts to start expanding our capacity and it's kind of been ongoing since then really. So I don't know that we really measured it or talked about it if we did. I don't recall it back then, but I can tell just from being here, it was extremely minimal, how about that\u2026\nJason Seidl: Okay. Well, I guess, what the question I'm trying to get at is there's a certain amount of excess capacity that you probably want in your network. Otherwise, you sort of get diseconomies of scale and things have become tight and your operations might suffer if you're operating at a 105% or something like that in jamming freight through the network. So what's that number \u2013 what's a comfortable number to get down to, obviously, 20% is probably too much capacity and it will allows you to grow, but what's a comfortable level on an operational basis to keep up sort of your service metrics for the clients?\nGreg Gantt: Jason, let me say this. We talked about the 15% to 20% or 20% to 25%. We talked about those numbers really for your benefit. To tell you the truth that's not necessarily how we look at it. We look at it on a need basis. We look at where we know that we're outgrowing our capacity, and those are the places that we try to address first. Now, obviously when we expand the location or build a new location, whatever, we're building capacity and we know, okay, we're 50%, 70%, 80% of capacity in that place. And we'll roll it up to come up with the number for you guys. But honestly, we look at it on a case by case basis. We look at it on a market by market basis where we're busting at the seams and where we're growing and maybe where we've \u2013 we just haven't done quite the job from a marketing standpoint or from a sales standpoint. We know we're on the low side and we know we can improve in those markets. And those are the ones that we target for growth or for expansion, if you will. So I hope that makes sense and I hope that answers your question.\nJason Seidl: No, it does. It makes a lot of sense and I appreciate the time as always gentlemen.\nGreg Gantt: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the question on purchase transportation, could you maybe tell us what percent of your line haul that you're currently outsourcing? And if that's changed over the last couple of quarters and maybe remind us what it's been historically, and when you think you'll be able to bring most of that back in-house?\nAdam Satterfield: Allison, we don't necessarily track in firms of number of dispatches. I mean, we see how many we're utilizing and then what thoughts and are selective with where we're doing it, but the baseline purchase transportation that we have that is our Canadian operation and truckload brokerage primarily usually runs about 2.2% thereabouts of revenue. So we're up about a full operating point on that, about 110 basis points or so, and, like I said, I think that may go up slightly, maybe 3.5%, 3.7% or so in the third quarter as we continue to utilize it, but we're making our efforts every day, every driver that we can find, we're bringing in and onboarding and continuing to put in place. But it's overall a very small percentage of dispatches that we have that are being outsourced.\nAllison Landry: Okay, that's helpful. And then, I mean, obviously there has been some notable transactions in the LTL space by some PL carriers. Just curious to get your thoughts on any potential implications whether that's from a pricing standpoint or perhaps it will move up some terminal availability for you and maybe if you think there's the potential for further industry consolidation or M&A. Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: It's something that at least from the early indications of what's been pointed out on the street of the few transactions each one has talked about increasing pricing to improve margins. So, again, that's something that will certainly help with our pricing initiatives if you've got every other carrier that's going out and trying to raise rates. So we'll see if there are any other transactions, certainly the market is very consolidated as you know and we don't expect any new entrance in terms of just the new carrier, it's any changes have been new players by way of acquisition. So we'll continue to watch and see how some of the new owners manage those other businesses. And in the meantime, if that creates right opportunity for us, that's typically what we see is that becomes a little freight churn, and we either get freight directly, or in some cases just indirectly as the churn within the industry happens, but we will continue to work with our customers. And if we're a common carrier with a customer that has got one of these other entities, our sales team is always in there trying to identify freight opportunities for us. And so in some cases that's what creates a market share opportunity for us, but we've got multiple sources of how we win share. And we certainly believe that we've got a long runway for growth ahead of us, and we'll continue to execute on that front. And in regards to service center availability, we haven't necessarily seen anything at this point in terms of reducing the number of service centers for many of the other big public carriers. And certainly, we're \u2013 we've got our eyes out and wouldn't be willing to look at any opportunities because obviously in our long-term plans we continue to have a pretty long list of areas that we want to expand to. So we're at 248 service centers today and think that we've got a list of sort of 35 or 40 locations on our long-term plan that we want to continue to add to the network and support additional market share opportunities for us. And if we have to build them, we will. That's what's been a bigger part of our plan in recent years, but certainly if the existing terminals become available, we'd take advantage of those opportunities as well.\nAllison Landry: Okay, perfect. Thanks Adam.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Allison.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good morning, gens. So you guys continue to execute incredibly well in a good market, but I'm a little surprised that you're stepping up the pace of the buyback here. I mean, clearly, that's good to Old Dominion shareholders and that's awesome, but historically you've been at entity that's going to really reinvest it back in the business. Your stock kind of just on consensus numbers right now is not particularly cheap. So what's the messaging there? I mean, do you think that you guys can become the first trucking company to break into the 60s war and so normalized EPS has just significantly higher than current levels, so the stock is much cheaper than we think it is, or what's the messaging there on the buyback step-up? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Well, there is a lot to unpack there, but I'll say this since I started the Old Dominion in 2004, I've heard the story that our stock was expensive and look at where we are today from a stock price standpoint versus where we were back in 2004. So yes, but that's depending on our continued ability to execute on our plan. And from a buyback standpoint, we continued to look at the buyback program and our dividend program in terms of returning excess capital to our shareholders. I think that we'd been clear that our first priority for capital spending is going to be capital expenditures and strategic investments that provide very solid returns on invested capital for us. And we want to continue to grow the business, in some years that will be heavier CapEx in plant. And we've got the flexibility of the buyback program to look at what our capital needs for the business are and to use it more or less in returning excess capital to our shareholders. So we think it's been a good program for us in the past, but again our first priority is to continue to invest for growth. And that's what we've seen over the long-term and that's what we continue to expect. And Greg mentioned that that 50% growth and keep coming back to this. I know we start thinking about short-term trends and things like that, but over the next 10 years we've talked about the past 10, but over the next 10, we continued to expect that the industry would grow above GDP. We continue to have plans to expand our service centers and take advantage of market share opportunities and grow our shipment counts significantly over the next 10 years. So it just takes continued execution of our business model has been successful in the past. And we think that it will continue to be a successful force into the future, producing very strong returns.\nRavi Shanker: There are going to be no debate that you've executed so far. Thanks very much, gens.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. I wanted to ask you a bit about the \u2013 I guess the 2022 view and kind thinking about cycle impacts from truckload spillover. It seems like you're pretty proactive about the pricing and trying to keep the right quality of freight in your system, but how do you think about the potential risk to 2022 tonnage if either freight growth slows down or truckload capacity, if they finally get some traction on drivers, which I know is tough. Do you think of that as a meaningful potential headwind? Or how do you think about just how much truckload spillover effect there may have been in 2021? It just seems like that that could be a meaningful factor.\nGreg Gantt: Tom, that's a good observation and then the exact reason why we've taken the actions that we have to protect our capacity now to support our customers, traditional LTL shipments, those truckload spillover type shipments that can weigh 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. Typically, we manage those within our spot quote system. Spot quotes for us historically have been somewhere 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, it's less than 1% and we've got a truckload brokerage operation that some of our existing customers move into LTL shipments that have these larger opportunities for us. We can put through our truckload brokerage and provide a solution for them, but we want to make sure that we're paying more attention to our traditional LTL shippers that we're protecting our service and capacity for them as we continue to get feedback that they need capacity. Industry capacity is tight. We're hearing that more and more. It started probably a little bit sooner this year than I expected. We thought that we would hear that feedback given what the sequential transit look like for us, but it certainly come to us maybe a little bit sooner at least the panic if you will. And so, we want to make sure that that we're protecting our customers and giving them what they need, but there's no reason for us to tie up capacity with these transactional type loads that are here today and gone tomorrow. We want to make sure that that we're doing the right thing in protecting the market share that we have that will be with us for the long-term.\nTom Wadewitz: Right. Okay. So you \u2013 you think you're pretty well protected in terms of risk on truckload spill over going away in 2022, just because of some of the actions you've taken recently. Is that the right way to read it?\nGreg Gantt: Correct. We've already moved it out essentially of our system as evidenced by that, that reduction in the spot quote type of business that we have. So we feel good about where we are and transitioning into next year and, obviously we have customer conversations every day, but continue to believe that, that there will be ongoing freight opportunity for us with traditional good pain LTL shipments.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. And thank you for that. And then just a follow-up question. Inflation and labor availability is such a big topic these days, and certainly seems to be affecting transports where normally we don't and in a different way. And yet you seem like your \u2013 I don't want to say immune but that that's not having much impact on your business. Is there a bigger wage increase in normal coming potentially related to that? Is there kind of maybe risk of higher dock pay or have you seen some of that come in, or how do you think about that inflation impact on your business or perhaps just the jobs and quality of culture you have are real differentiator that, that helped you. But maybe if you could offer some thoughts on tight labor market and is there an impact or coming impact?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Tom, no question. It's a tighter labor market than certainly we're used to. Of course, I've been here for a long time and I don't ever remember that the growth percentages that in the past that we've got today. So it's definitely a bigger challenge than it's ever been, but there is a labor market out there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we've had some like it\u2019s a 1,100 in the second quarter, and we planned to continue to hire in the third quarter. There are folks out there; it is more difficult than it's been. And I think I've mentioned that on our last call or two, it's a little harder to acquire people than it used to be, but we're having success. We're working extremely hard at it, and I think I've mentioned that before they're there, you just have to work harder to get them, and that's what we're doing and that's why we have had some success. But as far as the dollars goes, surely we have to respond based on the market. We give a wage increase every year, as Adam mentioned for we given in September and we certainly plan to do that this year and it may possibly be better than it's been in the past. So yes, you have to respond, but, you have to work at where your needs are, you have to work to fix them. So that's what we've been trying to accomplish, but it's an ongoing effort for sure.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Congratulations on the strong results. Appreciate it.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks, and good morning. We didn't pick it up in the labor issue. You're adding, I think another thousand in the third quarter, what do you think you sort of quarterly needs might look like beyond that, I guess in fourth quarter, maybe another thousand people. When you think about sort of where the volume is, where your resources are and sort of what's the right numbers or some catch up that's going on right now?\nGreg Gantt: Well, I think you probably know our peak season is the third quarter particularly in September. So hopefully if we get the folks on board in the third quarter, I would expect those needs to really to level-off into the fourth quarter. The other thing that we have to deal with in the summer months, obviously we have to cover vacations and those kinds of things, so that that pushes your needs up a little quicker too than sometimes you realize. So hopefully we'll see who knows, and this is where the growth goes. If the growth continues to expand and how quick it expands, all those things will make a difference in our needs, but certainly we'll try to respond however we need to.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Now, that's very helpful. I appreciated that. And then just picking up on that growth dynamic, I mean maybe if we take a step back, you guys talk a lot about sort of the longer term opportunity for growth in the business and sort of where you see your share opportunities. If we were to look out three, five years, how much more tonnage you think you sort of should be able to take on over that period of time. Obviously there's some secular dynamics that are benefiting the LTL industry and you guys are certainly taking share, and maybe some of these recent transactions instead of potentially making the landscape a little bit more challenging from a share perspective, as you mentioned; maybe open up some opportunities for you. So I don't know if you could just maybe take a step back and give us a bigger picture perspective on where you think this might go?\nGreg Gantt: Chris, we haven't necessarily put out any specific targets necessarily for revenue growth and market share, but certainly believe that given the tightness in the industry and generally the lack of investment in service center expansion by the other carriers. And we look at the public group which is about 65% of the overall industry. But we're just not seeing necessarily any significant investment out of that group as a whole, and so that creates more and more market share opportunity for us. So, we're sitting at 10% to 11% market share today and certainly believe that, that we were the biggest winner of market share over the last 10 years and believe we'll be the biggest winner in regards to market share over the next 10. So, however it takes us to get to where we're going we'll see. We haven't \u2013 like I said published that number, but we certainly believe that that the opportunities there we've got the capacity now and intend to continue to invest in capacity ahead of our growth and try to stay a couple of years ahead of the growth curve. So we just don't necessarily want to publish anything specific, I guess, at this point.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful though. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ari Rosa with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Hey, good morning guys. Congratulations on a nice quarter. So I wanted to stay on the subject of wage inflation a bit. I think, if I look at compensation per employee it was up about 10% year-over-year and kind of recognizing there were some anomalous things with last quarter, but it was also seems to have taken a pretty big step up sequentially. So I wanted to think about third quarter, and as you think about kind of the wage increase that's planned for September; maybe any kind of indication in terms of how that looks either on a sequential or year-over-year basis. And if there's some kind of targeted measures that you're doing in terms of targeted bonuses or certain geographies where you're really focusing on maybe taking wages up, just some thoughts around that would be helpful?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Just looking at the average salary wages and benefits number that we publish and divide that by the average number of employees can somewhat be skewed if you will. And I think that that's driving some of that quarter-over-quarter increase thinking about the actions that we had to take last year and then the actions that we're taking now, but try to give you a little bit more color. I mean, I can say that when we started this year we talked about our core inflation being somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis, excluding fuel. And that included the normal 3% to 3.5% increase that, that we give \u2013 that's what we did last September and certainly we will be given an increase. We haven't announced that to employees yet and so I want to hold back on sharing any color before it goes out. But as Greg mentioned we connect the success of the company with our employees, personal financial success and certainly feel that they will be rewarded for their efforts and for how well the company's performing. Looking into the second quarter in particular though, and we kind of expected this we did have an increase in some of our fringe benefit costs over the period that rate \u2013 that fringe rate was quite a bit higher than where it was in the second quarter of last year and quite a bit higher frankly than where we were in the first quarter. And that some of the anomaly that comes along with the growth in employees. Our employees have been working very hard, working more hours and as you add to your employee count, if you got four employees that were working 50 hours a week, and now you've got five that are working 40 that changes the dynamics. The same amount of hours are there to be worked, and the wage looks the same, but you've got the benefit cost for that fifth employee that increases there. So that's something that we've seen historically when we're growing head count that you get a little bit of lag effect with those benefits. And some of that will continue into the third quarter as well. I'd expect that we might have a little bit higher fringe percentage rate than coming into the year. I targeted and believe we'd be somewhere around 34% that is our fringe benefit as a percentage of salaries and wages. We were a little north of that during the second quarter, and I expect this to be a little bit north of that as well as we transitioned into the third. But, we're offsetting those were obviously costs that, that we overcame in 2Q given the strong top line revenue performance and the leverage that creates on other costs. And then we've got the base, a larger base of employees to thereby grow from. So it's all good and it's all included our expectations of being included as we transitioned in 3Q and some of the comments that I made earlier about where we think that that operating ratio might train to. But we will start to see as we get into the back half of this year, that core inflation start looking more on a per segment basis. Like what we'd expected through the first half of the year, it looked a little different. We've actually in the second quarter; our cost per shipment excluding fuel was down slightly. Certainly seeing the big increase in fuel cost right now, but that will normalize a little bit more as we get into the back half of the year.\nAri Rosa: Got it. That's really helpful color. Thanks for that, Adam. And then just for my second question I wanted to hit on, and maybe I missed this, but just in terms of, I know you usually disclose cargo claims ratios and on-time performance. I don't think I heard that earlier on the call and kind of in a related vein, I wanted to hear if having this kind of elevated purchase transportation expense or kind of on-boarding new employees, maybe how that's impacting service. I know there's usually kind of a little bit of a transition period there. Just your thoughts around it having kind of less direct oversight over freight as a result of kind of outsourcing more line haul, if that's kind of in some way impacting your service metrics or how you guys think about kind of managing service to the level that you've expected given that you're outsourcing more of that freight to third parties?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly when you lose a little bit of control, there is that risk that it can have a negative impact on service. And as we talked about in prepared remarks that our expectation, whether it's our employees or that have a third-party partner that we're utilizing to move the freight, the expectation is the same that we want to give superior service to our customers. And that's what we're always striving for. Certainly believed that we continue to show the best-in-class service metrics, our cargo claims ratio continue at 0.1% during the quarter. And that's really the \u2013 what we strive to do, it's the value proposition we offer our customers, and it's something that we've got to pay very close attention to, but when you have the control if you will over managing the employees and the freight and having the equipment, it's certainly a lot easier to continue to have each of our employees bought into the overall success of the company. They understand over the years as we've improved our service metrics what that's done in terms of the profitable growth that we produced in our totally bought in and to delivering the very best service to our customer. So we want to continue to keep on that promise if you will. And I think every employee is continuing to be motivated by delivering the very best service to our customers.\nAri Rosa: Great. Sounds good. Thanks for the time, Adam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. We're pretty long into an LTL call and I don't think that there's been a question on kind of core pricing or core yield. So Greg, I'll see if you'll entertain this one. Yields during the quarter X fuel were up 10% and obviously there's some impact there from mix in the lower weight per shipment. But do you have any comments just directionally on what you're seeing in kind of the contract renewal environment? I know you're not giving a specific number there, but is this an environment where contract renewals are still accelerating and as you think about kind of the potential for some tightness in the back half of the year. Is this a market that can sustain another GRI here this year? Is that something that's more of a 2022 type phenomenon at this point?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Todd, if you're talking about a GRI, we have no intentions of anything in the second half of the year. That'll be a 2022 event for sure, but the environment has been favorable probably more favorable than I can ever recall, which is a good thing. But as we've always been in the past, I'll say this time, the renewals are probably a little better than, than we've experienced before. Okay, we are having some more success, but as we've always done, we've addressed accounts on an [indiscernible] basis. If we have needs to improve those accounts, we've addressed those needs and tried to make improvements supporting. So I don't \u2013 I don't think our strategy or our approach will change at all. And that's what we'll continue to do, try to be consistent and try to be fair with our customers.\nTodd Fowler: Yes. Got it. That makes sense. And I would think similar to some of the earlier comments that there is some tailwinds from what others are doing in the industry. So, just as a follow-up on the weight per shipment here in the quarter is down about 4% year-over-year, it was down sequentially. And it sounds like that mainly that reflects some actions taken with some spot TL shipments, but is that roughly where the weight per shipment should settle out at this point? Or do you see that moving more either based on economic factors or specific mix issues within the network? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Yes. I would think so. It seems to have somewhat stabilized in the last couple of months. So I would expect those \u2013 that trend to continue unless something changes with what we're doing with spot quotes, and I don't anticipate that not any time soon. And Adam may have something to add to that, but that's kind of where we are today.\nAdam Satterfield: Now, I think we'll continue to see kind of in that 1,550 to 1,600 pound range near where we've somewhat settled now, but it could move up and down a little bit from here, but I think at this point we're kind of settled in for likely the balance of the year.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. I'll try and be quick. Adam, can you just talk directionally about some of the components of that 35% revenue growth in July? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I don't want to give too much just because it certainly can move around, but yes, I would just say that, that certainly the yield performance is remaining consistent. Some of the year-over-year change if you will in weight per shipment where we're trending down about that same 4%. So seen a similar type of change in the yield and obviously that implies and that was around 14% as you know, so that kind of implies what the tonnage number would be. We'll see where it falls in, but plus or minus it's just going to be somewhere around 19% threshold.\nScott Group: Okay, great. And then in terms of the uses of cash, would you guys ever think about buying another LTL and then, or maybe with the buyback, if you wanted to do it in a full year like you've typically done in the past, would you think about using any debt on the balance sheet for the buyback? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Scott, I'll let Adam answer that financial question last, but at this point we certainly aren't looking to acquire another LTL. I'm not sure that makes sense and at the same time, if you go back through the history of acquisitions, certainly major ones. We haven't seen a whole lot of success, but I don't think we want to wait into that at this point. But yes, we certainly did our share back in the day, but most of those are smaller tuck-ins and geographies where we had needs and those kinds of things. So just our needs are different today than what they used to be. And at this point we have no real strong appetite for that.\nAdam Satterfield: And on the buyback, we had no intention at this point of using debt to finance additional buybacks. We want to continue to use the cash that we have on hand. And we continue to expect a significant cash flow from operations as we continue to see improvement there. And despite the increases that we've had in CapEx and certainly could have a big CapEx number next year as well. We haven't really fine tune that, that will come later in the year, but based on demand trends that we see, I would expect that we'll have another pretty healthy year of CapEx. We just have a tremendous amount of free cash flow and we're trying to return that to our shareholders. And we've got a pretty nominal dividend and this will continue to use the flexibility of the buyback program as we have in the past to return that excess capital back and maybe work down some of the cash balance that's on the balance sheet as well.\nScott Group: All make sense. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hey Greg. Hey Adam. Thanks for the time here. I'm just wondering if you can remind me what's your cross-border presence look like. I know we talk a lot about e-commerce when we think about some of these secular growth opportunities, but just wondering if there's anything on the near shoring side that that's meaningful and whether you've seen any more demand for that cross border capability either north or south.\nAdam Satterfield: Now that's, it's we've got the services certainly to Canada, primarily. We've got services to Mexico and really consider Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and so forth in our OD global division as well. But the Canada is the biggest opportunity we continue to see growth there, but we don't have assets there. We've got a good partner and that partnership in regards to the business that we may have going north, and then they handle it, or their customers that may have freight coming south has created opportunities for us. And certainly would expect some growth to continue there in that regard, but it's a smaller element of business overall for us.\nBruce Chan: Okay. I appreciate that. And just one last one here. Can you remind us of what your mix of 3PL business looks like right now? And do you have any meaningful plans to change that in the near future?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. It's about 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. A lot of our top 50 customers, we've got a pretty healthy mix of big 3PL accounts that are in there. And we've seen growth last year, especially during the pandemic as they were helping their customers out; we were continuing to get a good amount of freight coming out of those 3PL customers. So we've got very good relationships, most are strategic in nature. We don't have as many relationships with the 3PLs that are more transactionally minded and now trying to sell cheap rates because that's just not us and doesn't necessarily fit with our profile, but I think when they're out selling value to their customers I think they can help. And in regards to independently proven our value equation and looking at our own time performance and our claims ratio in regards to inventory management and so forth, and how maybe paying for a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion service can deliver cost savings if you think about things on a total cost of transportation standpoint for their customers. So it's been a good independent source coming in to support revenue growth, and we'd expect that we continue to see some growth with them as well into the future.\nBruce Chan: Okay. Great. Thanks, Adam. Appreciate the color.\nAdam Satterfield: Okay, Bruce.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning guys.\nGreg Gantt: Hey, good morning, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, just one quick question. I know call has been long here. I want to come back to the equipment talk that you did upfront and its role in the capacity equation. So I'm just curious, but does this shift in e-commerce and serving these big distribution centers? I would imagine that that's driving more dropping hook requests, but does that change your trailing equipment means fundamentally, could that be an area of investment or is that really not a needle mover?\nGreg Gantt: Well, Tyler at this point it hasn't significantly changed our needs or requirements. Without a doubt we have experienced some delays with some accounts and getting our equipment unloaded. We certainly try to manage those advance when they happen, so we can get our equipment back. But it's definitely been a challenge, but at this point we haven't \u2013 I don't think we've changed the ratio of trailing equipment to tractors that we typically look at to determine the needs of trading equipment. So we'll continue to look at that, but I think that's a bit fair question, and if those needs change and we'll certainly address it, but at this point, nothing significant.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. Thanks guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Well, thanks all of you for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Thank you, good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team produced another record breaking quarter and established new company records for quarterly revenues, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. While the comparison of our numbers with the second quarter of 2020 is somewhat skewed due to the impact of the pandemic related shutdowns last year, our second quarter business momentum this year helped to drive the improvement in our revenue and profitability. Our revenue grew 47.2% to $1.3 billion and our operating ratio improved 550 basis points to 72.3%. As a result, our earnings per diluted share grew 84.8% to $2.31. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has guided us through many economic cycles and it is currently driving impressive growth in this strong market. Two key elements of this plan are delivering superior service at a fair price and consistently investing in capacity to help ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We often discussed our unwavering commitment to providing our customers with superior service. This quarter, I would like to offer a deeper dive into how we think about capacity given its relevance to the current environment. There are three major elements of capacity within LTL, doors at our service center, our equipment and our people. Doors can be the most limiting form of capacity in the short-term, which is why we try to stay several years ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We have invested $1.7 billion in our service center network over the past 10 years, which has allowed us to expand our door count by over 50%. Our current capital expenditure plan includes $275 million to further expand the capacity of our service center network, but we are willing to spend even more if we identify properties that are included in our long-term plan. Our commitment to the ongoing expansion of our service center network is important regardless of the macroeconomic environment due to the strong returns on capital for our business. We have consistently invested in the Old Dominion's expansion even in years when our market share trends have been flattish. Due to the confidence we have in our long-term market share potential, although expanding the capacity of service centers takes a significant amount of time, demand trends can change very quickly in our industry, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a large capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes most apparent to shippers and tight environments like this year. We estimate that we currently have 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open several new facilities during the second half of this year. As a result, the capacity of our overall service in our network is in good shape. Although we continue to focus on the needs of certain locations to help ensure, we are keeping up with increased opportunities for growth. We are prepared to address these needs as well as any other elements of capacity that need to be expanded, as it appears that current demand trends will continue into 2022. We believe the domestic economy is strengthening for both our industrial and retail related customers and we expect additional growth in volumes based on current economic forecast as well as customer feedback. We also continue to see accelerating trends with our revenue. We have exceeded a normal sequential trend for each quarter since the cliff event that affected the second quarter of 2020. This outperformance has continued with our month-to-date revenue for July 2021 as well. While we feel good about our service center network, we have faced challenges with the other elements of capacity this year. There've been some delays with equipment deliveries that have caused us to continue to operate older units that were intended to be replaced. We're fortunate to have this as an option due to the fact that we are one of the youngest fleets in our industry. While our suppliers are somewhat behind schedule, we do believe that we will receive each unit that we have ordered this year. These new units will supplement our current pool of equipment and are expected to satisfy our equipment needs through the second half of this year. The capacity of our people continues to be our biggest need to support ongoing growth. We were successful during the second quarter with our hiring efforts and actually exceeded our goal for the period. We added over 1,100 full-time employees between March and June, and we expect to add another 1,000 full-time employees during the third quarter of this year. We will continue to use third party purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our people and our fleet until those two elements of capacity catch up with the growth in our volumes. Regardless of whether it is our employees and equipment or a third-party moving the freight, we remain focused on providing best-in-class service to our customers. As I previously said, providing superior service at a fair price and having capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve are two key pillars to our long-term strategic plan. The centerpiece of our plan though remains our people. Our OD Family of employees is committed to servicing our customers, while also growing our business. As a result, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to take advantage of the opportunity for further profitable growth and increase shareholder value over the long-term. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Jack. Sure, Jack. No question about it. I mean, the e-commerce has continued to grow as everybody knows and we've benefited from that as well as some of our competitors, but it's strong. I'm not sure I see any change in that if anything continued growth especially with changes that we've had with the COVID and how people continue to stay at home and work from home and those kinds of things. I think that have continued to drive some of the e-commerce and the middle-mile business that we've enjoyed in the last period of time \u2013 over the last period of time, so definitely strong, getting stronger. And I think, like I mentioned before, with all the investments that we continue to make and positioning ourselves to have capacity and to be able to do the things that some of our competitors can't because of it, I think we're in a good position, Jack. So, I can tell you, we won't be aggressive and take share with price. We've never, we've never used that strategy and certainly don't intend to do that in this market that we're in today. As you know we're extremely busy as \u2013 the 47% growth, that type of growth, it does take capacity out of your network pretty darn quick, but I will say this we've got some nine \u2013 if I looked at it correctly, we've got nine facilities that we're trying to open in the back half of this year. I'm not sure we'll get all nine of them open, but we will get several of them between now and the end of the year and the other should come early in the 2022. And we have some 1 dozen or 12 service centers where we're adding doors, we're adding door capacity. So, we're working on continuing to grow our capacity just as quickly as we can. And besides that, those are just the projects that are underway that's not counting all the funds that we're trying to accomplish with land purchases and those kinds of things. So we're working to grow it as we speak. It's an ongoing effort. Again, this business that we're facing today, it takes it out pretty darn quick, sometimes it takes it out quicker than you put it back, but we are working on it, like I said, as we speak. Yes, I think for the third quarter especially that it's going to stay at an elevated amount, we actually use quite a bit more in the month of June as we've worked through the end of the quarter strength that we typically see there. We actually had to step up our utilization of it somewhat and we expect it to be actually probably a little bit higher in the third quarter than the 3.3% that we used in 2Q. But I think that as we continue to be successful with bringing people on board that we'll be in the position to hopefully through the fourth quarter and as we transition in 1Q of next year to be able to increasingly use our people and our equipment and reduce that reliance. But because of the strength of the top-line, we just had to continue to pull that lever of using the purchase transportation to continue to serve our customers. And so that's certainly something that we can continue to do through the third quarter and \u2013 but ultimately as you know our strategy is to try to have everything in-source from a domestic line haul standpoint and that's where we ultimately want to get back to. So it's just because of the strength of the top-line. We've had to use it a little bit longer through the year than we had originally intended. Sure. Jason, I don't know that we necessarily any competitors actions in terms of new accessorials or changes in accessorials necessarily impacts us, obviously when the pricing environment is strong like it is right now that provides a lift to everyone and supports our own pricing initiatives. But I think we have a differentiated approach to pricing and we've seen that and it's really been the foundation for why we produce such long-term profitable growth. We have a strategy of looking at our cost inflation and then we try to target increases in our revenue per shipment to give us a cost plus pricing. And that formulates the approach every year goes into our general rate increase when we push that out, that goes into what we try to achieve from a contract renewal standpoint as well. With that said each account must stand on its own from an individual profitability standpoint. And so we would look at each account on an individual basis and what the cost inputs are for that particular account and what our pricing needs to look like to provide an appropriate return for us. And I think we've got really good consistency across our book of business. I think we saw that last year in the disruption in particular, in the second quarter when a large percentage of our business shifted to larger national accounts. And I think there was a concern by some on the street about what that would do to margins. And we went through the second quarter of last year with a 15% decrease in revenue, a change in mix of our business, but we were able to still improve our operating ratio with the pricing actions and the cost control measures that we had in place as well. So we're going to stick to our long-term consistent approach and continue to push for cost plus pricing because it's important for us to continue to expand our capacity. We're one of the few carriers that that really has invested over the long-term. As Greg mentioned this morning, we've invested and expanded our door count over the last 10 years by over 50%. And that supported about a 50% improvement in shipments per day over that same timeframe. So we're uniquely positioned to continue to gain share in a market that that continues to somewhat at least from the reports we get on the public carriers, the number of service centers over that 10 year period have stayed about the same or reduced slightly. So it's a good spot for us to being and to continue to take advantage of opportunity. Certainly, we're going to do it with price, but we should see the volumes come through and improve density as well. And as you know that density and yield formula produces long-term improvement in our operating ratio. And so, we've got further room to improve from where we are today. Oh gosh, Jason, I am \u2013 you'd have to go way back. I think there was maybe a point in time and I'm going way back some 20 plus years when we probably had very little capacity. But if you \u2013 I don't know how long you followed us exactly, But... 22, well, that's probably about when we really ramp it up, really it was in the early 2000s. We really ramped up our efforts to start expanding our capacity and it's kind of been ongoing since then really. So I don't know that we really measured it or talked about it if we did. I don't recall it back then, but I can tell just from being here, it was extremely minimal, how about that... Jason, let me say this. We talked about the 15% to 20% or 20% to 25%. We talked about those numbers really for your benefit. To tell you the truth that's not necessarily how we look at it. We look at it on a need basis. We look at where we know that we're outgrowing our capacity, and those are the places that we try to address first. Now, obviously when we expand the location or build a new location, whatever, we're building capacity and we know, okay, we're 50%, 70%, 80% of capacity in that place. And we'll roll it up to come up with the number for you guys. But honestly, we look at it on a case by case basis. We look at it on a market by market basis where we're busting at the seams and where we're growing and maybe where we've \u2013 we just haven't done quite the job from a marketing standpoint or from a sales standpoint. We know we're on the low side and we know we can improve in those markets. And those are the ones that we target for growth or for expansion, if you will. So I hope that makes sense and I hope that answers your question. Sure. Well, there is a lot to unpack there, but I'll say this since I started the Old Dominion in 2004, I've heard the story that our stock was expensive and look at where we are today from a stock price standpoint versus where we were back in 2004. So yes, but that's depending on our continued ability to execute on our plan. And from a buyback standpoint, we continued to look at the buyback program and our dividend program in terms of returning excess capital to our shareholders. I think that we'd been clear that our first priority for capital spending is going to be capital expenditures and strategic investments that provide very solid returns on invested capital for us. And we want to continue to grow the business, in some years that will be heavier CapEx in plant. And we've got the flexibility of the buyback program to look at what our capital needs for the business are and to use it more or less in returning excess capital to our shareholders. So we think it's been a good program for us in the past, but again our first priority is to continue to invest for growth. And that's what we've seen over the long-term and that's what we continue to expect. And Greg mentioned that that 50% growth and keep coming back to this. I know we start thinking about short-term trends and things like that, but over the next 10 years we've talked about the past 10, but over the next 10, we continued to expect that the industry would grow above GDP. We continue to have plans to expand our service centers and take advantage of market share opportunities and grow our shipment counts significantly over the next 10 years. So it just takes continued execution of our business model has been successful in the past. And we think that it will continue to be a successful force into the future, producing very strong returns. Thank you. Tom, that's a good observation and then the exact reason why we've taken the actions that we have to protect our capacity now to support our customers, traditional LTL shipments, those truckload spillover type shipments that can weigh 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. Typically, we manage those within our spot quote system. Spot quotes for us historically have been somewhere 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, it's less than 1% and we've got a truckload brokerage operation that some of our existing customers move into LTL shipments that have these larger opportunities for us. We can put through our truckload brokerage and provide a solution for them, but we want to make sure that we're paying more attention to our traditional LTL shippers that we're protecting our service and capacity for them as we continue to get feedback that they need capacity. Industry capacity is tight. We're hearing that more and more. It started probably a little bit sooner this year than I expected. We thought that we would hear that feedback given what the sequential transit look like for us, but it certainly come to us maybe a little bit sooner at least the panic if you will. And so, we want to make sure that that we're protecting our customers and giving them what they need, but there's no reason for us to tie up capacity with these transactional type loads that are here today and gone tomorrow. We want to make sure that that we're doing the right thing in protecting the market share that we have that will be with us for the long-term. Correct. We've already moved it out essentially of our system as evidenced by that, that reduction in the spot quote type of business that we have. So we feel good about where we are and transitioning into next year and, obviously we have customer conversations every day, but continue to believe that, that there will be ongoing freight opportunity for us with traditional good pain LTL shipments. Yes. Tom, no question. It's a tighter labor market than certainly we're used to. Of course, I've been here for a long time and I don't ever remember that the growth percentages that in the past that we've got today. So it's definitely a bigger challenge than it's ever been, but there is a labor market out there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks we've had some like it's a 1,100 in the second quarter, and we planned to continue to hire in the third quarter. There are folks out there; it is more difficult than it's been. And I think I've mentioned that on our last call or two, it's a little harder to acquire people than it used to be, but we're having success. We're working extremely hard at it, and I think I've mentioned that before they're there, you just have to work harder to get them, and that's what we're doing and that's why we have had some success. But as far as the dollars goes, surely we have to respond based on the market. We give a wage increase every year, as Adam mentioned for we given in September and we certainly plan to do that this year and it may possibly be better than it's been in the past. So yes, you have to respond, but, you have to work at where your needs are, you have to work to fix them. So that's what we've been trying to accomplish, but it's an ongoing effort for sure. Thanks. Well, I think you probably know our peak season is the third quarter particularly in September. So hopefully if we get the folks on board in the third quarter, I would expect those needs to really to level-off into the fourth quarter. The other thing that we have to deal with in the summer months, obviously we have to cover vacations and those kinds of things, so that that pushes your needs up a little quicker too than sometimes you realize. So hopefully we'll see who knows, and this is where the growth goes. If the growth continues to expand and how quick it expands, all those things will make a difference in our needs, but certainly we'll try to respond however we need to. Chris, we haven't necessarily put out any specific targets necessarily for revenue growth and market share, but certainly believe that given the tightness in the industry and generally the lack of investment in service center expansion by the other carriers. And we look at the public group which is about 65% of the overall industry. But we're just not seeing necessarily any significant investment out of that group as a whole, and so that creates more and more market share opportunity for us. So, we're sitting at 10% to 11% market share today and certainly believe that, that we were the biggest winner of market share over the last 10 years and believe we'll be the biggest winner in regards to market share over the next 10. So, however it takes us to get to where we're going we'll see. We haven't \u2013 like I said published that number, but we certainly believe that that the opportunities there we've got the capacity now and intend to continue to invest in capacity ahead of our growth and try to stay a couple of years ahead of the growth curve. So we just don't necessarily want to publish anything specific, I guess, at this point. Yes. Todd, if you're talking about a GRI, we have no intentions of anything in the second half of the year. That'll be a 2022 event for sure, but the environment has been favorable probably more favorable than I can ever recall, which is a good thing. But as we've always been in the past, I'll say this time, the renewals are probably a little better than, than we've experienced before. Okay, we are having some more success, but as we've always done, we've addressed accounts on an [indiscernible] basis. If we have needs to improve those accounts, we've addressed those needs and tried to make improvements supporting. So I don't \u2013 I don't think our strategy or our approach will change at all. And that's what we'll continue to do, try to be consistent and try to be fair with our customers. Yes. I would think so. It seems to have somewhat stabilized in the last couple of months. So I would expect those \u2013 that trend to continue unless something changes with what we're doing with spot quotes, and I don't anticipate that not any time soon. And Adam may have something to add to that, but that's kind of where we are today. Scott, I'll let Adam answer that financial question last, but at this point we certainly aren't looking to acquire another LTL. I'm not sure that makes sense and at the same time, if you go back through the history of acquisitions, certainly major ones. We haven't seen a whole lot of success, but I don't think we want to wait into that at this point. But yes, we certainly did our share back in the day, but most of those are smaller tuck-ins and geographies where we had needs and those kinds of things. So just our needs are different today than what they used to be. And at this point we have no real strong appetite for that. Hey, good morning, Tyler. Well, Tyler at this point it hasn't significantly changed our needs or requirements. Without a doubt we have experienced some delays with some accounts and getting our equipment unloaded. We certainly try to manage those advance when they happen, so we can get our equipment back. But it's definitely been a challenge, but at this point we haven't \u2013 I don't think we've changed the ratio of trailing equipment to tractors that we typically look at to determine the needs of trading equipment. So we'll continue to look at that, but I think that's a bit fair question, and if those needs change and we'll certainly address it, but at this point, nothing significant. Well, thanks all of you for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to call us if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 47.2% in the second quarter included a 28.1% increase in LTL tons and a 14.9% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 10.3% reflecting success of our yield improvement initiatives as well as changes in the mix of our freight. While the growth in our revenue and volumes reflects an easier comparison with the second quarter of 2020, the sequential acceleration in our revenue during the second quarter was once again well above normal sequential trends. On a sequential basis second quarter LTL shipments per day increased 12.1% over the first quarter of 2021 as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.6%. LTL tons per day increased 9.7% as compared to a 10-year average sequential increase of 7.9%. These 10-year average trends exclude our 2020 metrics for more normalized comparison. While both our shipments and tons outperformed our long-term averages, the discrepancy between our shipment and tonnage trends as a result of the decrease in our LTL weight per shipment. We have made operational changes over the past few quarters, mainly through pricing actions to limit the number of heavy weighted and larger harder-to-handle types of shipments in our network that are typically more transactional in nature. We increase these efforts during the second quarter, given the ongoing tightness in our industry to preserve capacity for our customers, traditional LTL shipments. At this point in July with only a few days remaining in the month, our revenue per day is trending higher by approximately 35% when compared to July 2020. The year-over-year revenue comparison gets tougher for us in the third quarter, as our revenue per day turned positive in August 2020 and increased overall for the third quarter of 2020. We will provide actual revenue related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. The operating ratio for the second quarter improved 550 basis points to a company record 72.3% with improvement in both our direct operating costs and overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. This improvement was essentially in line with the target we discussed on our first quarter earnings call. Overhead related costs as a percent of revenue improved 490 basis points due primarily to the operating leverage created by the quality of our revenue growth. Much of the overall improvement in overhead as a percent of revenue related to our depreciation and wage and benefit costs for ourselves and administrative employees. Within our direct operating costs, the wage and benefit cost for our driver's, platform employees and fleet technicians improved due primarily to an improvement in the overall efficiency of our operations. This improvement more than offset the increases in operating supplies and expenses, which reflects the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products, as well as the increased utilization of purchase transportation to supplement our workforce. While we will continue to add employees during the second half of this year to support our anticipated growth, we believe we can effectively balance our direct operating cost with revenue as we continue to focus on productivity and ultimately reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $198 million and $508.3 million for the second quarter and first half of 2021 respectively, while capital expenditures were $155.1 million and $206.1 million for the same periods. We returned $63.2 million of capital to share folders during the second quarter and utilize $395.4 million of cash through the first half of this year for both our dividend and share repurchase programs. This year-to-date total for share repurchases include $68.8 million that is deferred until the third quarter when the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement. We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $2 billion of our outstanding stock. We intend to fund this program with cash flows from operations and existing cash to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders. Our first priority for capital spending, however, will continue to be strategic investments in capital expenditures to support the long-term profitable growth of our business. Our annual effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2021 was 26% as compared to 25.7% in the second quarter of 2020, and we currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third floor. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Thanks, Jack. Sure. Yes, on the revenue per day basis, obviously, we've still got a few important days to close out the month, but we're trending very favorably at this point for the month of July. And our revenue per day at this point is a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential trends would indicate and it really just follows the pattern that we've seen over the last four quarters that we've referenced. We've exceeded normal sequential trends on a quarterly basis, and really see no reason at this point why that would change as we go into the third quarter. It's \u2013 the market continues to be really tight, the feedback that we're getting from customers. We just continue to see the service advantage and capacity advantage that we have in the marketplace is winning share for us. And so, we're trying to do all the things as we referenced in our prepared remarks to continue to prepare for further growth and to provide best-in-class service to our customers. So we'll continue to do all those elements to get prepared. And as we get through the balance of this year and really continue to try to position the company for 2022. With respect to the margin question, we typically see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter. And I think that we'll see somewhere in that same ballpark 50 to 70 basis points maybe, so kind of flattish as we go from the second quarter, are consider that flattish. But just a slight increase we typically see and have our wage increase is effective the 1st of September. We're a little behind schedule on some of our equipment deliveries as Greg mentioned as well. So that means that we'll have a little bit more depreciation hitting us in the third quarter than typically where it would have been loaded into the first half of the year. So a few factors like that that may come on board, but certainly continuing to see strength as we work our way into the third quarter. Allison, we don't necessarily track in firms of number of dispatches. I mean, we see how many we're utilizing and then what thoughts and are selective with where we're doing it, but the baseline purchase transportation that we have that is our Canadian operation and truckload brokerage primarily usually runs about 2.2% thereabouts of revenue. So we're up about a full operating point on that, about 110 basis points or so, and, like I said, I think that may go up slightly, maybe 3.5%, 3.7% or so in the third quarter as we continue to utilize it, but we're making our efforts every day, every driver that we can find, we're bringing in and onboarding and continuing to put in place. But it's overall a very small percentage of dispatches that we have that are being outsourced. It's something that at least from the early indications of what's been pointed out on the street of the few transactions each one has talked about increasing pricing to improve margins. So, again, that's something that will certainly help with our pricing initiatives if you've got every other carrier that's going out and trying to raise rates. So we'll see if there are any other transactions, certainly the market is very consolidated as you know and we don't expect any new entrance in terms of just the new carrier, it's any changes have been new players by way of acquisition. So we'll continue to watch and see how some of the new owners manage those other businesses. And in the meantime, if that creates right opportunity for us, that's typically what we see is that becomes a little freight churn, and we either get freight directly, or in some cases just indirectly as the churn within the industry happens, but we will continue to work with our customers. And if we're a common carrier with a customer that has got one of these other entities, our sales team is always in there trying to identify freight opportunities for us. And so in some cases that's what creates a market share opportunity for us, but we've got multiple sources of how we win share. And we certainly believe that we've got a long runway for growth ahead of us, and we'll continue to execute on that front. And in regards to service center availability, we haven't necessarily seen anything at this point in terms of reducing the number of service centers for many of the other big public carriers. And certainly, we're \u2013 we've got our eyes out and wouldn't be willing to look at any opportunities because obviously in our long-term plans we continue to have a pretty long list of areas that we want to expand to. So we're at 248 service centers today and think that we've got a list of sort of 35 or 40 locations on our long-term plan that we want to continue to add to the network and support additional market share opportunities for us. And if we have to build them, we will. That's what's been a bigger part of our plan in recent years, but certainly if the existing terminals become available, we'd take advantage of those opportunities as well. Thanks, Allison. Yes. Just looking at the average salary wages and benefits number that we publish and divide that by the average number of employees can somewhat be skewed if you will. And I think that that's driving some of that quarter-over-quarter increase thinking about the actions that we had to take last year and then the actions that we're taking now, but try to give you a little bit more color. I mean, I can say that when we started this year we talked about our core inflation being somewhere around 4% on a per shipment basis, excluding fuel. And that included the normal 3% to 3.5% increase that, that we give \u2013 that's what we did last September and certainly we will be given an increase. We haven't announced that to employees yet and so I want to hold back on sharing any color before it goes out. But as Greg mentioned we connect the success of the company with our employees, personal financial success and certainly feel that they will be rewarded for their efforts and for how well the company's performing. Looking into the second quarter in particular though, and we kind of expected this we did have an increase in some of our fringe benefit costs over the period that rate \u2013 that fringe rate was quite a bit higher than where it was in the second quarter of last year and quite a bit higher frankly than where we were in the first quarter. And that some of the anomaly that comes along with the growth in employees. Our employees have been working very hard, working more hours and as you add to your employee count, if you got four employees that were working 50 hours a week, and now you've got five that are working 40 that changes the dynamics. The same amount of hours are there to be worked, and the wage looks the same, but you've got the benefit cost for that fifth employee that increases there. So that's something that we've seen historically when we're growing head count that you get a little bit of lag effect with those benefits. And some of that will continue into the third quarter as well. I'd expect that we might have a little bit higher fringe percentage rate than coming into the year. I targeted and believe we'd be somewhere around 34% that is our fringe benefit as a percentage of salaries and wages. We were a little north of that during the second quarter, and I expect this to be a little bit north of that as well as we transitioned into the third. But, we're offsetting those were obviously costs that, that we overcame in 2Q given the strong top line revenue performance and the leverage that creates on other costs. And then we've got the base, a larger base of employees to thereby grow from. So it's all good and it's all included our expectations of being included as we transitioned in 3Q and some of the comments that I made earlier about where we think that that operating ratio might train to. But we will start to see as we get into the back half of this year, that core inflation start looking more on a per segment basis. Like what we'd expected through the first half of the year, it looked a little different. We've actually in the second quarter; our cost per shipment excluding fuel was down slightly. Certainly seeing the big increase in fuel cost right now, but that will normalize a little bit more as we get into the back half of the year. Yes. Certainly when you lose a little bit of control, there is that risk that it can have a negative impact on service. And as we talked about in prepared remarks that our expectation, whether it's our employees or that have a third-party partner that we're utilizing to move the freight, the expectation is the same that we want to give superior service to our customers. And that's what we're always striving for. Certainly believed that we continue to show the best-in-class service metrics, our cargo claims ratio continue at 0.1% during the quarter. And that's really the \u2013 what we strive to do, it's the value proposition we offer our customers, and it's something that we've got to pay very close attention to, but when you have the control if you will over managing the employees and the freight and having the equipment, it's certainly a lot easier to continue to have each of our employees bought into the overall success of the company. They understand over the years as we've improved our service metrics what that's done in terms of the profitable growth that we produced in our totally bought in and to delivering the very best service to our customer. So we want to continue to keep on that promise if you will. And I think every employee is continuing to be motivated by delivering the very best service to our customers. Now, I think we'll continue to see kind of in that 1,550 to 1,600 pound range near where we've somewhat settled now, but it could move up and down a little bit from here, but I think at this point we're kind of settled in for likely the balance of the year. Well, I don't want to give too much just because it certainly can move around, but yes, I would just say that, that certainly the yield performance is remaining consistent. Some of the year-over-year change if you will in weight per shipment where we're trending down about that same 4%. So seen a similar type of change in the yield and obviously that implies and that was around 14% as you know, so that kind of implies what the tonnage number would be. We'll see where it falls in, but plus or minus it's just going to be somewhere around 19% threshold. And on the buyback, we had no intention at this point of using debt to finance additional buybacks. We want to continue to use the cash that we have on hand. And we continue to expect a significant cash flow from operations as we continue to see improvement there. And despite the increases that we've had in CapEx and certainly could have a big CapEx number next year as well. We haven't really fine tune that, that will come later in the year, but based on demand trends that we see, I would expect that we'll have another pretty healthy year of CapEx. We just have a tremendous amount of free cash flow and we're trying to return that to our shareholders. And we've got a pretty nominal dividend and this will continue to use the flexibility of the buyback program as we have in the past to return that excess capital back and maybe work down some of the cash balance that's on the balance sheet as well. Thanks, Scott. Now that's, it's we've got the services certainly to Canada, primarily. We've got services to Mexico and really consider Puerto Rico, Alaska, Hawaii and so forth in our OD global division as well. But the Canada is the biggest opportunity we continue to see growth there, but we don't have assets there. We've got a good partner and that partnership in regards to the business that we may have going north, and then they handle it, or their customers that may have freight coming south has created opportunities for us. And certainly would expect some growth to continue there in that regard, but it's a smaller element of business overall for us. Yes. It's about 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. A lot of our top 50 customers, we've got a pretty healthy mix of big 3PL accounts that are in there. And we've seen growth last year, especially during the pandemic as they were helping their customers out; we were continuing to get a good amount of freight coming out of those 3PL customers. So we've got very good relationships, most are strategic in nature. We don't have as many relationships with the 3PLs that are more transactionally minded and now trying to sell cheap rates because that's just not us and doesn't necessarily fit with our profile, but I think when they're out selling value to their customers I think they can help. And in regards to independently proven our value equation and looking at our own time performance and our claims ratio in regards to inventory management and so forth, and how maybe paying for a little bit more upfront for Old Dominion service can deliver cost savings if you think about things on a total cost of transportation standpoint for their customers. So it's been a good independent source coming in to support revenue growth, and we'd expect that we continue to see some growth with them as well into the future. Okay, Bruce."

Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our financial results were highlighted by new first quarter records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. The operating momentum that began in the second half of 2020 continued through the quarter and we also benefited from and improving domestic economy. Our revenue increase to $1.1 billion as a result, which is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. 14.1% revenue growth rate was also our highest since the fourth quarter of 2018. After essentially going through two flattish years in 2019 and 2020, our revenue was relatively flat over the past two years, and that was an unusually long period for us to go without growth. We maintained our commitment to our long term strategic plan and invested during those times for our future. Our first quarter financial results validate the benefits of this long term strategy. Our strategic plan has worked throughout many economic cycles. We generally see our largest increases in market share when the domestic economy is strong, and industry capacity is generally limited. This is the environment in which we are now operating. We have also recently received encouraging feedback from many of our customers regarding the ongoing recovery of this business, of these business levels and their increased demand for our services. As a result, we expect to see a continued acceleration in our market share trends as we progress through this year. Our focus is never to simply increase market share and revenues. Our objective is to win market share in a way that can produce profitable revenue growth. We achieve this goal in the first quarter, as our ability to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price contributed to the increase in our volumes, resulting improvement in density, as well as an increase in yield that exceeded cost inflation led to the 76.1% operating ratio for the quarter and 53% increase in earnings per diluted share. The favorable operating environment and improving trends we intend to invest significantly in all elements of capacity this year to support our revenue growth initiatives. This starts with our OD family of employees, which already grew by over 1000 new full time employees during the first quarter. We intend to hire additional employees this year to further increase the capacity of our workforce. In addition, we all support our team's ability to deliver superior service by investing approximately $605 million in capital expenditures during 2021. This total includes new tractors and trailers, as well as an expansion of our service center network that could include an additional four to six service centers. We will also continue to invest in new technologies that are designed to improve customer service and increase the efficiency of our operation. OD team will be diligent in managing productivity, cost and capacity this year to maximize our ability to produce profitable growth in 2021. This diligence, however, will not affect our focus on the long term opportunities for our business. We believe we are the best position company in the LTL industry to win market share in both the current environment and over the long term. This provides us with confidence that the continued execution of our strategic plan, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity, can produce additional growth in earnings and increased shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion, which was a 14.1% increase from the prior year despite having one less work day. Our operating ratio improved 530 basis points to 76.1% and earnings per diluted share increase to $1.70. Our per day revenue growth of 15.9% included a nice mix of increases in both our LTL tons and yield. LTL tons per day increased 10%, while our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6%. We are winning market share as demand for our industry leading service has increased while the domestic economy is improving. In addition to our service advantage that includes 99% on time performance and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%, our proven strategy of investing and service center capacity ahead of anticipated growth has also provided us with a capacity advantage in the marketplace. This strategy is different for many of our competitors, as we believe the average number of service centers operated by the other large LTL carriers has decreased over the past 10 years. We currently have approximately 25% excess capacity within our service center network, which is in line with our long term targets and we plan to further expand our network this year to stay ahead of our growth. Our plan is to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to growth. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increase 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.5%. These were all above our normal sequential trends, which typically declined from the fourth quarter. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows; January increased 0.3% as compared with December, February decreased 4.4% versus January, and March increased 10.7% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 2.2% in February, and an increase of 5.1% in March. While there are still many workdays that remain in April, our revenue performance has remained strong. Our month to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 45% to 50% when compared to April of 2020. As a reminder, our revenue decreased 19.3% in April 2020, due to the significant impact of the COVID related shutdowns. We will provide the actual revenue related details for April in our first quarter form 10-Q. Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 76.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We have said many times before that the long term improvement or operating ratio requires an improvement in density and yield, both of which are generally supported by a favorable macro economic environment. The strength of our first quarter results reflect how important these factors are to our success. Our direct costs benefited from an improvement in our line-haul laden-load average and pick up delivery shipments per hour during the quarter. We lost a little productivity on the dock. But that is common when business levels accelerate and we add a significant number of new employees. While we would like to see our platform productivity improved, we believe it is more important for these employees to properly load our trailers to maximize employee safety in line-haul efficiency, while also protecting free from damage. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the second quarter as our volume trends continue to accelerate. We will also continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter primarily by successfully leveraging a revenue growth. As expected and mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain calls that were reduced in 2020 because of the pandemic have started to increase. While many of these calls such as travel and customer entertainment are not completely back to pre-pandemic levels. We expect that there will be sequential increases in aggregate overhead costs this year. We will maintain our disciplined approach to controlling discretionary spending however, and make every effort to minimize cost inflation and other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations total $310.3 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $51 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $605 million this year, which includes $275 million for service center expansion projects. We utilize $309 million for our share repurchase program and paid $23.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total share repurchase amount includes $275 million attributable to an accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. Our first quarter shares outstanding reflects the initial delivery of shares under this Agreement, and a final calculation of total shares. repurchased will occur no later than the end of August of this year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 26.0% as compared to 26.3% in the first quarter of 2020. And we currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter of 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we would be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question. At this time it comes from Jack Atkins from Stevens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Great. Thank you. Good morning and congrats on a great quarter, guys.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Jack.\nJack Atkins: So, so maybe if we can just start with April. And I know, the month isn't done yet. So -- and I know you want to hold off on the specific comments until the 10-Q comes out. But Adam, would it would it be possible to maybe kind of talk bigger picture around what you're seeing sequentially in April relative to March? The comparisons, both year-over-year and sequentially are just abnormal this year, because of what was happening last year, and obviously, how strong March was. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing April versus March from a tonnage and shipment perspective relative to normal seasonality?\nAdam Satterfield: And it's hard to get into the details of that on tonnage and shipments basis, because the trends have been a little more or unusual, if you will, and not following the same types of patterns in the sense of the way -- our weight per shipment has been trending intra month and so forth. We've been seeing some wider shipments earlier in the month, and then it just strengthens throughout and then gets heavy at the end. But nevertheless, our overall revenue, obviously 45% to 50% on a comparison basis with April suggests that we are seeing continued strength and acceleration in our business. We had incredibly strong performance in March, at tonnage per day, that was up 10.7% versus the normal 5.1% increase, that was the 10-year average. And then that followed the weakness that we saw in February. So probably, a little bit of recovery there, that helps support that number. And then just the way the math work. But I think that we're continuing to see revenue perform pretty much in line with what we'd expect from a sequential standpoint. As you mentioned, the year-over-year weights and shipments are going to look a little unusual. Whereas last year, we had such an increase in late March and through April, and the weight per shipment. So that certainly will throw things off a bit. But we'd look to see continued strong revenue performance, and whether that's coming through in tonnage, shipments and yield, I think it's really all of the above. They're all performing well, and contributing to excellent revenue quality, and obviously in the first quarter that's contributing to really strong profitable growth force.\nJack Atkins: Absolutely. Absolutely it is. So that's great to hear on the April trends. And then, I guess maybe a bigger picture question to follow up. We're hearing from a number of LTLs, both public and private, that they're highly capacity constrained, given what's happening in the broader market. And they're taking steps to actually limit the volume that they're taking in from their customers. And I would think that given the latent capacity that you guys have in your network, you mentioned 25% in your prepared comments, this is going to give you a chance to really demonstrate your value proposition, potentially, to new customers. So I guess, how are you thinking about balancing the approach between making sure you're handling the needs of your existing customer base that are surging volumes, but also perhaps using this opportunity in a capacity constrained environment to expand your customer base? How do you balance those two factors?\nGreg Gantt: Jack, as you know, we've always talked about our ability to grow and outgrow our competitors when the market was strong, like it is today. So I think we're definitely seeing the evidence of that. We're not capacity constrained. I think we've made tremendous investments, particularly in the last 10 or 15 years to increase our capacity and it's obviously paying off for. So, I think we're in a very unique and a very positive position when the market turns as positive as it is today. From the standpoint of constricting volumes or limiting volumes, whatever you want to call it, we have not had to do that. We have limited some truckload type shipments that we're coming our way more so -- more strong, much stronger back in March than today. But we have had to limit some of those types shipments and keep them out of the truckload. But otherwise we're not capacity constraint. It's full steam ahead where we're trying to hire and add to our workforce to meet those capacity demands. And so far we're having success. I wish it was sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we're in a good position moving forward and all things go.\nJack Atkins: Right, Greg, Adam, thanks for the comments. Appreciate it, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question. It comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Congrats, Adam, Greg on a great quarter. If I think about the sequential acceleration in April, just trying to understand if you're seeing that in yields, as well. Or yield holding kind of at these levels, at these high levels, and you're seeing tonnage and shipment growth accelerate? And the reason I just asked this question is I'm trying to understand, when OpEx per shipment has to inflect more meaningfully getting back to closer to that 4% to 5% level, because it's actually been declining over the last couple quarters. Partly, I assume, because of the attribution to growth from yield and pricing. So just talk about yields, where yields are moving prospectively from here? And when you think OpEx per shipment needs to get back higher as shipment growth moves up?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. The yield numbers is similar to conversation we just had about volume. They're going to look a little unusual as well. Last year in April, our average weight per shipment was 1677 pounds.. And we've been trending now around the 1600 pound range. So we're going to see, if things continue a pretty meaningful drop, and that similar to what we experienced in March as well. So you can with a big decrease in the weight per shipment, obviously that has a favorable impact on revenue per hundredweight. And so we've got a big inflection there. Not to mention that last year in April was when the fuel dropped significantly. So we're going to have a bigger contribution from the fuel surcharge as well. You might be looking at and certainly we saw double digit type increase in revenue per hundredweight. And that doesn't tell the story necessarily from a pure yield and revenue per shipment standpoint. And we saw a nice improvement in the first quarter on revenue per shipment. And that benefited from both higher weight per shipment and a higher length of haul as well. And all those metrics go into our yield management process. We've got a process that's focused on individual account profitability, and one that focuses on continuous improvement as well. And I think that our sales team, our pricing teams, they've worked really hard over the last couple of years, to make sure that we're seeing continuous improvement in each of our customers operating ratios. And that's certainly bearing fruit when you look at our numbers and how that may transition into the second quarter as well. So, it's probably going to be more of just looking at that pure number. Look and comparison on a sequential basis from first quarter revenue per hundredweight that I know drive everyone's models in that normal sequential transition from 1Q to 2Q. And if you look at it excluding the field, we were right at $21 on a revenue per hundredweight basis in 1Q. And typically, we see, an average about 1.5% increase from 1Q to 2Q if mix is held constant. So that would suggest another $0.25 to $0.30 sort of sequential increase, if you will, and that revenue per hundredweight metric excluding the fuel. But we're going to continue on with our focus and you asked about OpEx as well. The long term plan has always been to balance our revenue per shipment versus the cost per shipment performance and having a positive delta there to support the ongoing investments and capacity that essentially we're making on behalf of our customers, As well as investments in technology, tools and so forth. It can help us keep our cost structure lower, so that we can improve profit per shipment, without having to rely completely on pricing initiatives. But if we can continue to keep costs in check through productivity, and certainly right now, we're benefiting from the strong top line growth and just the increase in shipment is creating operating leverage that that's benefiting our cost structure there. And, as you mentioned, we did see a decrease in cost per shipment in the first quarter. But we were expecting, like we mentioned at the beginning of this year, core inflation of kind of 4% to 4.5%. We're just benefiting right now significantly from the leverage and productivity, yield performance in our business.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. And do you guys expect a step -- usually do see a step down in OR from 1Q to 2Q? I assume you'll expect that as well. But first quarter was quite strong as well. And pricing has been strong. So any thoughts around kind of the sequential progression in OR from 1Q to 2Q?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. It's certainly. I mean, that's the quarter where we get the biggest improvement. It's the quarter where we typically see the largest sequential increase in revenue performance as well. Typically, revenue per day is up 10% in the second quarter versus the first. And so, that leverage on existing cost base and so forth creates that opportunity for us. So -- we've -- on any given year, we've increased or improved the operating ratio in a range of 360 to 420 basis points. And certainly, we would expect to get some improvement this year. We've done a good job the last three quarters and have had nice sequential changes that have been kind of what our normal progression is. But now, we're starting to look at the cost that you mentioned that we expect to have some increases in our aggregate overhead costs. We performed very well in the first quarter and had some costs in categories that kind of went well for us. That we'll see if all the stars stay aligned as we transitioned in the second quarter. But certainly, our focus is always to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And we will continue to look at it, leveraging the improvement in our revenue and trying to continue with our productivity initiatives. Some of that, like we saw in the first quarter, where we lost a little productivity on the dock, as we continue to hire new employees and put them into the operation. Certainly, you can start seeing a little bit of headwind on productivity there. But our operation is running extremely smooth right now. And we're going to keep focused on making sure that we're focused mainly on keeping our service metrics best-in-class, secondary focus on productivity. But at the end of the day, we're trying to produce as much profitable growth as we can.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. Low 70s OR in the second quarter implied by seasonality would be pretty impressive. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Congrats again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Adam. So I just wanted to ask about the length of haul I mean, its been increasing for the last few quarters, and you're now sort of at the longest haul. I think you'd have to go back five years or so. So I'm just curious to understand. And do you think this is mainly a function of cyclicality? Or would you attribute this to some kind of secular shift, maybe e-commerce or something like that? Just trying to understand your view, if you think there's an underlying shift in the market or the freight dynamic?\nGreg Gantt: I don't think there's necessarily a big underlying change. The big picture changes that we feel like length of haul will probably shorten and that will continue to see improvement in our regional business. But we still have a very high quality, long haul and medium haul business. And I would say, over the past 12 months, really, since the COVID impact on the mix of our business that we've probably just seen a little bit more market share in with our contractual business, and certainly saw more growth. And for many periods out of the West right now, our growth is very balanced across all of our regions, but a lot of times the freight coming out of the West will have a longer length of haul associated with it. So we've seen tremendous growth there. And that's probably been causing a little uptick. But long term when we think about that continued shift and tailwind that we believe exist with e-commerce freight, we'd expect to see that market share and those regional lanes continue to increase and probably pull the length of haul back down with it.\nAllison Landry: Okay. So length of haul comes down and probably over time and then right now just be more mixed driven. Is that the way to characterize it? Is that fair?\nGreg Gantt: Exactly.\nAllison Landry: Okay. And then just, I mean, on the labor front, obviously, everyone's having challenges as far as hiring drivers and dock workers, warehouse called that. I mean, is it -- are you guys finding it more difficult than you've seen in past cyclical upswing or even tight capacity conditions that where you're sort of falling behind plan in terms of where you want to be for hiring? Or are you guys able to meet that? And maybe if you can speak to just the broader wage inflation and your expectations there? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Allison, I would say it's definitely a little more difficult than it has been in years past. But we're having success. Like I mentioned earlier, I wish sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we are having success. We're adding where needed. In the locations where we're having job fairs and things like that, run ads or whatever, we're, we're getting a nice response. And again, we're having success meeting our needs. I wish it was a little quicker. We've had a pretty significant uptick in business when -- as Adam mentioned, talking about April 45% to 50% increase, be it we were down last year. Still, that's a pretty significant uptick in business. And the difficulty is meeting the needs as quickly as the business is coming at you. So, I think that's the challenge. But again, I think we're doing well. We just have to stay focused on it and get the folks on board, which I feel confident we'll be able to do. So, I do not think that will limit us going forward.\nAdam Satterfield: And on the labor inflation standpoint, we gave our wage increase in September of last year. We would not expect -- or we're seeing the effects of that. And that was part of that overall core inflation of 4% to 4.5%. That was probably, all in 3% to 3.5%. So we're seeing that until September of this coming year on just pure inflation standpoint. But we are continuing to use the purchase transportation, though, and that amount stayed pretty much in the same range as where it was in the fourth quarter. And we talked about, hoping to see that number decline as we progress through the second quarter. And at this point, it's staying at the same level. So we'll keep using that supplement, the workforce until really we're in position to be able to handle anticipated growth with our complete team and everything in sourced where we would like it to be. But that's probably, we expect to still see PTE [ph] decrease on the second half, but just may be a little bit later in the year. But really the goal will be getting the workforce where it needs to be not only for this year, but really just gearing up and preparing for 2022.\nAllison Landry: Okay. That's great. That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We'll take the next question. It comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just want to pick up on the on the pricing side. Can you talk a little bit sort of contractual pricing renewals. Where that's coming in? I know you guys are making some efforts to keep some of the truckload business out of the network. But obviously, a strong overall freight environment right now. So kind of just curious if you give us a little bit of color, how those numbers are trending?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. That was probably long winded in my initial response. But we're coming right in where we would want to be and consistent with how we've trended over many years, because we've had a long term consistent process. And we've averaged an increase in our revenue per shipment of about 4.5%. And that is a target over our cost inflation of 75 to 100 basis points. So, certainly the strong demand when you've got a yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability. In a demand environment like this, we've got to think about opportunity costs with how we allocate capacity. And certainly when you've got accounts that may not be the best performing from an operating ratio standpoint, then we try to work through those as those accounts may be asking for more capacity from us. And so, certainly would try to get a little more in an environment like this when we may not be able to get as much in environments that are a little bit weaker. But core increases are going well. We're seeing good increases as the contracts are coming up. But that's what we shoot for year-in and year-out. We think have a differentiated approach where we tried to be consistent year-in and year-out with our customers and talk about the cost inflation that we're experiencing, and the increases that we need to offset that inflation. But again, also supporting the continuous investment and capacity that we're making on behalf of our customers. So that's all going well, right now, and certainly the environment is very supportive of our pricing initiatives this year.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Certainly seems like the case. And then just picking up on what you just mentioned in terms of the capacity additions, and maybe some of the real estate opportunities that you guys are looking at this year. Are those becoming more challenging? Is it difficult to continue to sort of keep that sort of physical footprint capacity growth in line with what you'd want it to be just given obviously, a very strong demand environment that we're seeing, but obviously, sort of tightness in kind of across the base and commercial, industrial real estate. Just kind of curious how you guys are seeing that process playing out? And do you see any maybe potential inflation creeping into those numbers? Or you okay with where you are?\nGreg Gantt: Chris, that's a great question. I think if you recall, we've talked a lot about that over the last several years. And it is definitely more difficult and much more challenging today to increase that brand on the real estate side than it used to be. But, we've worked extremely hard at it. We've got a very active real estate department that is searching where we know, we have needs, and we're trying to anticipate our needs as best we can. We're doing that. And we're having some success. And I've mentioned it in the past, there are some parts of the country that are much more difficult than others. And you just have to work harder at it for those places than you do in some of the other middle of the country type more rural areas. So, again, I think we're having the success that we need, be it more difficult, and it's obviously, it's more expensive. Thank you. You heard our numbers. We're talking about the $300 million real estate capital expenditure budget this year. And a lot of that is because of the inflation that we've seen related to real estate. So it's not -- certainly if we were doing this year of what we did maybe 10, 15 years ago, the number wouldn't be anywhere near that. So there's definitely some inflation there. But again, we're having success. I feel good about it. It's just a little more costly than it used to be. And certainly you have to work harder at it.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate the time this morning. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Chappell from Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Greg, you'd mentioned I think, an answer to one of the earlier questions about limiting some of the TL business out of your network. And we're certainly seeing a lot of headlines on some traditional TL tonnage going into the LTL. networks. Can you -- is there any way to quantify how much of your tonnage growth has been what you would consider kind of traditional TL? And then also, what's the stickiness of this freight? Is that something that comes on for the time being to the extent that you'll enable it to come on in and you can get a better price for that? Or is that something that you can actually turn on a longer duration, maybe contractual basis to add to your growth?\nGreg Gantt: It's not sticky at all, Jon. That business is about a slippery as it gets. It'll move between truckload and LTL depending on the capacity that the truckload market has at the time. So it's very slippery. It comes and goes. And that's why, we certainly don't want to load our network down with truckload type shipments when we certainly feel like we've got obligations to service our normal regular LTL type business. So we will continue to try to manage that as long as we have a need to manage it. So, as far as -- how much that amounts to? I don't know, Adam, you probably got a better feel for that than I do.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. It's been something where a lot of those shipments end up coming through our spot quote network and spot quote type business and other volume shipments. And in the past have been anywhere from 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, they're probably only 1% to 2% of revenue. So, we certainly have seen a decrease. Now, with that said, some of those -- some shippers, especially the larger accounts, when our weight per shipment increased last year, they just move heavier type shipments on their contractual rates. So some of that is transparent to us that a customer may have tried to move 6,000 pounds shipment by a truckload, if they could have found a carrier that may have performed a multi stop for them. So, it's not always clear. But what's clear is just us trying to understand all of the freight movement characteristics, the costing for each shipment, and the revenue that we need to have on each shipment that we move.\nJon Chappell: Now, that makes sense. And then as a follow-up and a follow-up to Chris is, in early February, you've mentioned plans to open two to three terminals in 1Q, hopefully, six or so through the rest of the year. And then just given some of those commercial real estate challenges, and Greg, your comment on having to work harder. You get to the point where maybe you look outside of organic growth, and there's kind of inorganic ways to make up for some of that growth at a time when most of your competitors are standing still, if not even contracting?\nGreg Gantt: Jon, no, we -- like I said, we're having success in the service centers that we've got planned for this year. They're well underway. They're not at the point where we're trying to find real estate and build. If we've talked about opening four, six or whatever it is, you can be sure those are well underway, or we wouldn't be talking about them. We do have a lot of places that we're still acquiring real estate and making plans and whatnot. But those are well underway. And again, as we talked about before, we feel like there's a lot of growth opportunity left in the -- on the LTL side. And that's what we're trying to do. That's what we've talked about now for years. That's our plan. That's our strategy. And we'll continue to execute on that going forward.\nJon Chappell: Great. Thank you, Greg. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: We'll take the next question. At this time, it comes from Todd Fowler from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Great. Thanks and good morning. I know you've touched on this kind of a couple different ways throughout the call. But thinking about the weight per shipment right now at around 1600 pounds, it's down from where it was in the second quarter of last year. But it's still above where you had been trending in 2017 and 2018, and even into 2019. So how do we think about kind of your freight basket? Is it kind of back to pre-pandemic levels? Are there still pockets that have customers that haven't come back? Or is there any shifts that are happening within the mix to see the weight per shipment works out right now?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that, the 1600 pound range, where we are, I think really reflects the strength of the economy, typically an increase in weight per shipment goes hand in hand with an improving economy. And to think about what I just mentioned, with the decrease in the number of spot quote shipments, oftentimes a spot quote shipments are averaging 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. So when you've got that mix of business that has now shifted into a percentage of business rather than shifted into our 559 tariff base customers and our larger contractual customers, I think it just reflects the underlying demand for our customers businesses. But we've seen really good performance with our smaller accounts. In recent months, our tariff based business is continuing to improve as a result and actually is trending slightly ahead as a percent of overall revenue than where we were pre pandemic. And then our contractual accounts, which performed well for us all last year, continuing to perform strongly as well. And so they actually are, are picking up a little bit more as well. And we're just seeing the higher balance in both of those categories versus that decrease in the mix from the spot quote. So it's good to see across the board, that when we look at our accounts, and think through that the increase in weight per shipment kind of goes hand in hand with the feedback that we're getting from our sales team that our customers businesses are improving. And there's just the increased demand for widgets out there that's creating freight opportunities for us. And certainly, we're taking advantage of that opportunity with our market share improvements.\nTodd Fowler: Yes. Okay, Adam. That makes sense. So it sounds like that the mix is normalized. And the change in weight per shipment is more a function of the economy at this point then kind of big shifts in the customer base right now?\nGreg Gantt: Yes.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. And then just to follow up. Do you care to share kind of any expectations around headcount growth, either sequentially into the second quarter, or kind of what your thought process would be for the full year. I know you shared some expectations in the first quarter, obviously, sounds like you're trying to catch up and ramp up on the headcount side. So if you have any kind of overall numbers, that would be great? And then also thoughts around productivity. I think that historically, maybe it's been six to nine months to get new employees up to a level of efficiency of more experienced hires. Is that kind of the right way we should think about this cycle? Are there any things that would impact that? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, initially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter. And typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase and shift there, and reflect on the success and the programs that Greg mentioned. Our HR team has done a really great job of continuing to bring people on board and get them ready for the acceleration and freight that we typically see through the second and third quarters. An average second quarter headcount is normally up a little over 2% for us. The biggest year we ever had was in 2014, again another strong period. Headcount was up 5%, that year, in the second quarter. And I think we're going to see probably a number more like that. We're still trying to catch the curve, if you will, with the growth that we're seeing. And still having to make use of some purchase transportation is mentioned. So we would expect to see that we're on the high end of that scale, and possibly even exceeding that, on that 5% metric in terms of the sequential change from first quarter, second quarter. And the productivity that you mentioned, like we mentioned, our prepared remarks, especially on the dock, it's pretty typical to see a loss of productivity. But it's certainly more important to make sure that the team is they come in new, they're learning, they learn our ways for claims prevention. They're following our safety protocols and so forth. And, and we're trying to maximize the loads that we're moving our line-haul costs, they're the biggest cost element that we face. So we've got to make sure that that we're properly loading these trailers to maximize the overall efficiency of the operation. And so certainly, that's something that we'll continue to experience is we're increasing headcount. But when we've got the top line revenue growth, that gives us a little covered offset, maybe some of this higher cost inflation that we're seeing.\nTodd Fowler: Yes, understood. Thanks for the time this morning, guys.\nOperator: We'll pick the next question. At this time. It comes from Ari Rosa from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Hi. Good morning, Greg, and Adam. Nice quarter. So, for my first question, I wanted to ask about salaries and benefits line. It was the best quarter as a percent of revenue that it's been in a number of years as far as I can tell. And I know last year, you had some special bonus payments, that it sounds like probably won't be recurring this year. And if I look at average salaries and benefits expense per employee, it took a step down sequentially. And I assume that's related to some new hiring, which presumably is coming in at slightly lower wages. So I guess my question is, when I think about comp per employee, can it stay in this range sequentially? Or does it take a little bit of a step up, given some of the wage inflation pressures that we're seeing and some of the challenges that other LTL carriers have spoken about with regard to hiring?\nGreg Gantt: I think going back to just pure comp per employee, again, we gave the wage increase last year of between 3% to 3.5%. I think that when you start looking at things on a year-over-year basis, all of the comparisons in the second quarter are going to be pretty unusual. But we're going to have higher costs related to group health and dental benefits. I think that we'll see our benefit cost per employee, some acceleration there. As we progress, we have pretty good performance. So those fringe benefit cost as a percent of normal salaries and wages in the first quarter were 33%, 33.2%. And so, that was good performance. We were anticipating somewhere more like 34% for this year, 34% to 34.5% was kind of my initial forecast. And so, saw good performance there. I think that possible that we'll continue to see some inflation there. The other factor is, we're certainly seeing inflation, when it comes to the performance based compensation that we have. With our improving financial results, we're going to see increases there as well. And that's something that really gets back to when we talk about our focus for hiring people. It all starts with our company culture and the family spirit that we have. That certainly has made it easier to both attract and retain employees. But the connection to the financial performance, and that direct link of the engagement of employees with connecting the company's financial success to their personal success through improved wages and benefits and contributions into our 401-K retirement program. Those are all things that helped keep driving the performance of the company. So those will continue to increase as the financial performance, both revenue and income are increasing as well. But I think we're in a great spot. And to keep getting some leverage. If we see that salary, wages and benefits line, there should be some natural inflation there too, is we in-source, and reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. So there shouldn't be some corresponding decreases once we kind of catch back up to the curve there. So multiple factors that's going to be driving that number for us.\nAri Rosa: Got it. Understood. That's very helpful. And then just my second question, you'd mentioned this -- that'll give 25% available capacity. Obviously, that implies a lot of room to grow. And as I think about the step up and CapEx that's expected. Kind of maybe if you can help contextualize what that 25% available capacity means, in terms of your ability to grow sequentially from these levels? I think a lot of transport companies spoke about first quarter being a little bit challenging given weather related obstacles to moving freight. As we think about -- forget the year over year comparisons, but just sequentially from here. How much room is there to kind of outgrow what the normal sequential pattern has been?\nGreg Gantt: That 25% reflects the door capacity that we have in our network. In an LTL network, it's the doors that is required to process freight. And it's obviously very critical and a long term investment and a long time to expand capacity, as we've discussed earlier on the call. So, that's something that we always have to stay focused on. And we feel like far ahead of our growth curve to make sure the network is never a limiting factor to us. But that's one of three key elements of capacity within LTL. Next would be on the fleet side. And I feel like we're in a really good spot, based on where our fleet is and the ability to handle the freight that we have today, as well as the ongoing increases that we would be anticipating this year. In coordination with the $290 million CapEx spend that we have planned for equipment this year. So I feel like our fleets in a really good spot. And obviously, you don't want to carry that much excess capacity like we do on the service center network side in your fleet, there's higher deer depreciation per unit cost there. You want to have enough to be able to handle the peaks at the end of the month and the end of quarters and to be able to accommodate growth. But you don't maintain that same excessive level. And then finally, and most importantly, is the people capacity. And certainly, that's something that we manage more in relation with revenue and volume trends. And it's something that we're constantly balancing here. And the lever we pull, like we're pulling right now, when we're a little short is we make use of purchase transportation. And we'll continue to do that until we complete the additions to the team that just sort of catch up with the freight volumes that we're currently experiencing. So, we're in a good spot across the board. And I think we've got a good plan, a very detailed plan and is different by service center and by region for how we're continuing to add drivers and platform employees to the team to continue to handle the accelerating volumes that we're seeing.\nAri Rosa: Okay, understood. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: We'll take the next question. Now, it comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Morning, guys. Adam, can you just talk about the impact of higher fuel and what it means for top line, bottom line incremental margin this year?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, obviously, from a top line basis, it's finally going to be turning for us, in the sense of for most of last year we faced the headwind with fuel prices being down in March. It turned if you will. And at this point, we're looking at fuel prices that are about 25% or so higher than where they were in April of last year. So that'll be a good thing from a top line standpoint for us. From a bottom line standpoint, much like we talked about last year, we tried to have our fuel scales, both for our own internal scale, as well as the scales that many of our larger contractual accounts have within their contracts to be somewhat neutral, whether fuel is going up or down, and we stress test those. But we didn't really talk too much about it. Last year, we felt -- when it was decreasing, we felt like, we would minimize the effect on the bottom line, based on the lower end of the fuel scales. And certainly now that it's showing a year over year increase, we'd hope to minimize the effect on the bottom line as well. But just keep managing through that on a customer by customer basis. And looking at what the revenue inputs are, and the cost inputs are to maximize profitability.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just a longer term question. What if anything, are you guys doing as relates to electric and autonomous trucks? Do you see any use cases for either over the next five years or so?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Sure, Scott. We were actually in the process of making a couple purchases to do some testing. We still from everything we see and hear that technology is not where it needs to be to help us at this point, but we are wanting to test some electric vehicles. Be it switchers, be it trucks or -- and/or forklifts. So that's in the process as we speak. But, again, I don't see any impact of that in the near future.\nScott Group: And autonomous?\nGreg Gantt: Any impact I'm saying from electric. Yes. On the electric side, right?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. On the autonomous piece, that's something that we feel like that technology is continuing to develop, and we'll continue to look at things. From a regulatory standpoint. I don't know that we ever, it's hard to envision seeing the driverless vehicle on the road, sharing the roadways with passenger autos. But we think that as the technology improves, that it will continue to drive improvements in safety. And certainly could drive some incremental benefit as well. But the technology may get there before it's really allowed from a regulatory standpoint. But something that we'll continue to watch. And obviously is, I think we've got one of the youngest fleets in the industry and are investing year in and year out, we always want to look at whatever safety or efficiency tools are available to us. And we've got the financial strength and ability to invest as those become available, and we feel like are practical to implement within our operation and certainly would be on board with taking advantage of whatever opportunities the manufacturers can come up with.\nScott Group: Thank you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. So I have two questions for you. One, you commented about the very strong, I think is that, I don't know 45%, 50% revenue per day growth in April. Are the comps much different in May, in June? Or do you think that commentary on April kind of could be representative of the quarter?\nGreg Gantt: April, was definitely the worst period that we experienced last year. That was the biggest drop that was just like freight and revenue levels fell off a cliff. And once things reset, we had pretty good recovery and sequentially increases for the most part that point forward. But from a revenue trend standpoint, in April, we were down 19.3% on a per day basis, like I mentioned in May, we were down -- May of 2020, we were down 16.2%. In June of 2020, we were down 11.5%. So each month, the change -- I guess the comp gets a little more difficult, but just reflects sequential improvements that we saw. Overall revenue for the quarter was down 15.5% second quarter of 2020.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. That's good. That's helpful. Thank you. Greg, if I look back at periods when you've had kind of peak as tonnage growth, it seems like you've gotten a couple times up to maybe 15% year over year tonnage growth. Is that possible you achieve that this year? I mean, you've got obviously a super easy compare in second quarter. And then you talk about the 25% door capacity. But obviously, you got the other two elements that Adam highlighted. So, is it feasible to get to a mid teens type of tons growth this year? Or is it hard to achieve for people or trucks or whatever?\nGreg Gantt: 15% tonnage, Tom, that's pretty steep. I'm not sure I recall those days. Maybe my memory seems. But we had 15 in 2018. But anyway, that's a pretty steep. We'll see it obviously, in the second quarter when we were so far back in 2020. But I'm not sure once we get back to normal type comparisons, we're going to see that kind of growth, that's probably a stretch. And to be clear, on that percent capacity, that's not a year over year growth. I mean, that's, that's capacity from the freight levels that we're handling here in March in the first quarter. Incremental growth on top of that, while we're also continuing to expand every day.\nTom Wadewitz: When you say that's hard to achieve, I think you did it in 2014, and 2018, you're probably close in 10 and 11. Is it just people, Greg, or what's the reason that that you couldn't do or it'd be tough to do 15%?\nGreg Gantt: It's hard to ramp up, Tom at that pace. I mean, obviously, if we knew we were anticipating that. If that was realistic, then it would certainly be more realistic, but I'm not sure, we'll see that those type numbers. I'm not sure the economy's quite that strong. While things are certainly good and positive. That 15% is a bit over where we are today.  Got to remember right, we just came off the rim. I just wanted to mention, reiterate, we came off the highest revenue quarter we've ever had in the first quarter. So you're talking about big numbers, bigger numbers on top of big numbers, if you will. And he's in obviously ignoring the year over year column. That's much easier Again, second quarter, we'll have some impressive numbers. I would certainly expect. But we get in the, like I say, more normal comparisons. I don't think we'll see that. The first and fourth quarters are more normalized versus the middle part of the year, where we've got some easier comps.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. That's helpful. Congratulations on the great quarter.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: We'll take the next question that comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Alright. Yes. Just sort of big picture question. With all the strength in LTL, as you mentioned, obviously pricings freight demand is extremely strong. Given what you're doing from a capacity standpoint, or with your cap spending. I mean, is there some concern, or is there some -- I mean, you see the industry trying to add capacity broadly, it not just the potential public guys, but sort of, maybe, the private LTL players too? Is there a broad scramble to increase industry capacity right now?\nGreg Gantt: I don't know that we've seen that. Jordan, I don't know that we've seen that at all. I expect some of them are trying to do something. But we haven't seen a whole lot of movement for the most part. We see -- every now and again, you'll see some carriers adding a terminal here and there. But like I mentioned earlier, when we look over a longer period of time, the reality is, there's been more of a decrease in the number of service centers in operation around the country versus we obviously have been focused on increasing. And we're doing that because of the market share opportunities that we continue to believe that are out there. And certainly we're positioned better than anyone with the service levels that we offer, the total value proposition. And we feel like that in this environment, more shippers are focusing on value, that's certainly what we sail. And there is a value to Old Dominion services, as well as the capacity. Our customers right now are certainly benefiting from the fact that we've made all of these capacity investments and they've got contracts in place with us. And we certainly can continue to handle increased levels of business with them. And we're getting the feedback from customers that many of our competitors are not able to handle some of the acceleration that they're seeing in their business. So that, too, is we have seen in the first quarter. And that's continuing where that capacity advantages is certainly driving freight our way. So anecdotally, feedback that we're getting from customers as well as just what we see in terms of total service centers and operation, on average, they are down. And we are benefiting from that at a time when we think the industry continues to have tailwinds. And that's just creating more and more opportunity for Old Dominion.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Once again, Greg, your initial comments on market share, I don't think I've heard you sound as explicit or as aggressive on the share gain opportunity as you did, which is obviously great to hear. But can you just kind of unpack that a little bit. Is that something to do with the kind of structural changes in the industry you seen in the last couple of quarters? Do you feel like some of your competitors are more vulnerable? Is it a function of the cycle where it is? Is it some kind of internal change and go-to-market strategy or messaging? Kind of what drove that?\nGreg Gantt: I don't think it's a change in strategy at all. Its this the strategy we've been talking about for a long time. And like I've mentioned before, and we've talked about over the years, we will grow more when the economy is strong. And when our competitors capacity is as limited as it appears to be, then the customers come to us. And that's what we've seen happening in recent months. And I expect that we will certainly have much stronger growth than most all of our competitors. So, we're waiting to see, but it's not any anything that we've done, the change. Is just the continued execution of the strategy that we set forth back some years ago. And like I said, before, we're executing and having success doing so. I feel good about where we are and the things that we've done. And now its the time when it starts to pay off for us. Yes. Pretty positive from that standpoint, for sure.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And if I can follow up on the on the labor question, which you hit a few times. And I think you even hit the autonomous truck question ones, but if I can just keep on that topic. What's the opportunity for automation on some of the other kind of labor parts of the business kind of on the dock and the terminal side, rather than the autonomous driving side, which I think it should be here in rightly shorter?\nGreg Gantt: I assume you're talking about robots and that kind of thing?\nRavi Shanker: Yes. I'm saying, have you done any studies? Or is there any opportunity at all to increase kind of automation on yes, things like robotic, forklifts or things like that, that can help you load the trucks and reduce the need for labor intensity there?\nGreg Gantt: Not that we've seen. Not at this point in time.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Got it. Thank you\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue. And I'd like to turn it back over to you for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Thank you. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning. And welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. We are pleased to report a great start to 2021 for Old Dominion. Our financial results were highlighted by new first quarter records for revenue, operating ratio and earnings per diluted share. The operating momentum that began in the second half of 2020 continued through the quarter and we also benefited from and improving domestic economy. Our revenue increase to $1.1 billion as a result, which is the highest level of quarterly revenue we have ever achieved. 14.1% revenue growth rate was also our highest since the fourth quarter of 2018. After essentially going through two flattish years in 2019 and 2020, our revenue was relatively flat over the past two years, and that was an unusually long period for us to go without growth. We maintained our commitment to our long term strategic plan and invested during those times for our future. Our first quarter financial results validate the benefits of this long term strategy. Our strategic plan has worked throughout many economic cycles. We generally see our largest increases in market share when the domestic economy is strong, and industry capacity is generally limited. This is the environment in which we are now operating. We have also recently received encouraging feedback from many of our customers regarding the ongoing recovery of this business, of these business levels and their increased demand for our services. As a result, we expect to see a continued acceleration in our market share trends as we progress through this year. Our focus is never to simply increase market share and revenues. Our objective is to win market share in a way that can produce profitable revenue growth. We achieve this goal in the first quarter, as our ability to deliver best-in-class service at a fair price contributed to the increase in our volumes, resulting improvement in density, as well as an increase in yield that exceeded cost inflation led to the 76.1% operating ratio for the quarter and 53% increase in earnings per diluted share. The favorable operating environment and improving trends we intend to invest significantly in all elements of capacity this year to support our revenue growth initiatives. This starts with our OD family of employees, which already grew by over 1000 new full time employees during the first quarter. We intend to hire additional employees this year to further increase the capacity of our workforce. In addition, we all support our team's ability to deliver superior service by investing approximately $605 million in capital expenditures during 2021. This total includes new tractors and trailers, as well as an expansion of our service center network that could include an additional four to six service centers. We will also continue to invest in new technologies that are designed to improve customer service and increase the efficiency of our operation. OD team will be diligent in managing productivity, cost and capacity this year to maximize our ability to produce profitable growth in 2021. This diligence, however, will not affect our focus on the long term opportunities for our business. We believe we are the best position company in the LTL industry to win market share in both the current environment and over the long term. This provides us with confidence that the continued execution of our strategic plan, combined with our financial strength and available network capacity, can produce additional growth in earnings and increased shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Thanks, Jack. Jack, as you know, we've always talked about our ability to grow and outgrow our competitors when the market was strong, like it is today. So I think we're definitely seeing the evidence of that. We're not capacity constrained. I think we've made tremendous investments, particularly in the last 10 or 15 years to increase our capacity and it's obviously paying off for. So, I think we're in a very unique and a very positive position when the market turns as positive as it is today. From the standpoint of constricting volumes or limiting volumes, whatever you want to call it, we have not had to do that. We have limited some truckload type shipments that we're coming our way more so -- more strong, much stronger back in March than today. But we have had to limit some of those types shipments and keep them out of the truckload. But otherwise we're not capacity constraint. It's full steam ahead where we're trying to hire and add to our workforce to meet those capacity demands. And so far we're having success. I wish it was sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we're in a good position moving forward and all things go. I don't think there's necessarily a big underlying change. The big picture changes that we feel like length of haul will probably shorten and that will continue to see improvement in our regional business. But we still have a very high quality, long haul and medium haul business. And I would say, over the past 12 months, really, since the COVID impact on the mix of our business that we've probably just seen a little bit more market share in with our contractual business, and certainly saw more growth. And for many periods out of the West right now, our growth is very balanced across all of our regions, but a lot of times the freight coming out of the West will have a longer length of haul associated with it. So we've seen tremendous growth there. And that's probably been causing a little uptick. But long term when we think about that continued shift and tailwind that we believe exist with e-commerce freight, we'd expect to see that market share and those regional lanes continue to increase and probably pull the length of haul back down with it. Exactly. Allison, I would say it's definitely a little more difficult than it has been in years past. But we're having success. Like I mentioned earlier, I wish sometimes it would happen a little bit quicker than it does. But we are having success. We're adding where needed. In the locations where we're having job fairs and things like that, run ads or whatever, we're, we're getting a nice response. And again, we're having success meeting our needs. I wish it was a little quicker. We've had a pretty significant uptick in business when -- as Adam mentioned, talking about April 45% to 50% increase, be it we were down last year. Still, that's a pretty significant uptick in business. And the difficulty is meeting the needs as quickly as the business is coming at you. So, I think that's the challenge. But again, I think we're doing well. We just have to stay focused on it and get the folks on board, which I feel confident we'll be able to do. So, I do not think that will limit us going forward. Yes. That was probably long winded in my initial response. But we're coming right in where we would want to be and consistent with how we've trended over many years, because we've had a long term consistent process. And we've averaged an increase in our revenue per shipment of about 4.5%. And that is a target over our cost inflation of 75 to 100 basis points. So, certainly the strong demand when you've got a yield management process that focuses on individual account profitability. In a demand environment like this, we've got to think about opportunity costs with how we allocate capacity. And certainly when you've got accounts that may not be the best performing from an operating ratio standpoint, then we try to work through those as those accounts may be asking for more capacity from us. And so, certainly would try to get a little more in an environment like this when we may not be able to get as much in environments that are a little bit weaker. But core increases are going well. We're seeing good increases as the contracts are coming up. But that's what we shoot for year-in and year-out. We think have a differentiated approach where we tried to be consistent year-in and year-out with our customers and talk about the cost inflation that we're experiencing, and the increases that we need to offset that inflation. But again, also supporting the continuous investment and capacity that we're making on behalf of our customers. So that's all going well, right now, and certainly the environment is very supportive of our pricing initiatives this year. Chris, that's a great question. I think if you recall, we've talked a lot about that over the last several years. And it is definitely more difficult and much more challenging today to increase that brand on the real estate side than it used to be. But, we've worked extremely hard at it. We've got a very active real estate department that is searching where we know, we have needs, and we're trying to anticipate our needs as best we can. We're doing that. And we're having some success. And I've mentioned it in the past, there are some parts of the country that are much more difficult than others. And you just have to work harder at it for those places than you do in some of the other middle of the country type more rural areas. So, again, I think we're having the success that we need, be it more difficult, and it's obviously, it's more expensive. Thank you. You heard our numbers. We're talking about the $300 million real estate capital expenditure budget this year. And a lot of that is because of the inflation that we've seen related to real estate. So it's not -- certainly if we were doing this year of what we did maybe 10, 15 years ago, the number wouldn't be anywhere near that. So there's definitely some inflation there. But again, we're having success. I feel good about it. It's just a little more costly than it used to be. And certainly you have to work harder at it. It's not sticky at all, Jon. That business is about a slippery as it gets. It'll move between truckload and LTL depending on the capacity that the truckload market has at the time. So it's very slippery. It comes and goes. And that's why, we certainly don't want to load our network down with truckload type shipments when we certainly feel like we've got obligations to service our normal regular LTL type business. So we will continue to try to manage that as long as we have a need to manage it. So, as far as -- how much that amounts to? I don't know, Adam, you probably got a better feel for that than I do. Jon, no, we -- like I said, we're having success in the service centers that we've got planned for this year. They're well underway. They're not at the point where we're trying to find real estate and build. If we've talked about opening four, six or whatever it is, you can be sure those are well underway, or we wouldn't be talking about them. We do have a lot of places that we're still acquiring real estate and making plans and whatnot. But those are well underway. And again, as we talked about before, we feel like there's a lot of growth opportunity left in the -- on the LTL side. And that's what we're trying to do. That's what we've talked about now for years. That's our plan. That's our strategy. And we'll continue to execute on that going forward. Yes. On the average headcount side, in the first quarter, initially, we were up 4.3% versus fourth quarter. And typically, our headcount is pretty flat. So there was a big increase and shift there, and reflect on the success and the programs that Greg mentioned. Our HR team has done a really great job of continuing to bring people on board and get them ready for the acceleration and freight that we typically see through the second and third quarters. An average second quarter headcount is normally up a little over 2% for us. The biggest year we ever had was in 2014, again another strong period. Headcount was up 5%, that year, in the second quarter. And I think we're going to see probably a number more like that. We're still trying to catch the curve, if you will, with the growth that we're seeing. And still having to make use of some purchase transportation is mentioned. So we would expect to see that we're on the high end of that scale, and possibly even exceeding that, on that 5% metric in terms of the sequential change from first quarter, second quarter. And the productivity that you mentioned, like we mentioned, our prepared remarks, especially on the dock, it's pretty typical to see a loss of productivity. But it's certainly more important to make sure that the team is they come in new, they're learning, they learn our ways for claims prevention. They're following our safety protocols and so forth. And, and we're trying to maximize the loads that we're moving our line-haul costs, they're the biggest cost element that we face. So we've got to make sure that that we're properly loading these trailers to maximize the overall efficiency of the operation. And so certainly, that's something that we'll continue to experience is we're increasing headcount. But when we've got the top line revenue growth, that gives us a little covered offset, maybe some of this higher cost inflation that we're seeing. I think going back to just pure comp per employee, again, we gave the wage increase last year of between 3% to 3.5%. I think that when you start looking at things on a year-over-year basis, all of the comparisons in the second quarter are going to be pretty unusual. But we're going to have higher costs related to group health and dental benefits. I think that we'll see our benefit cost per employee, some acceleration there. As we progress, we have pretty good performance. So those fringe benefit cost as a percent of normal salaries and wages in the first quarter were 33%, 33.2%. And so, that was good performance. We were anticipating somewhere more like 34% for this year, 34% to 34.5% was kind of my initial forecast. And so, saw good performance there. I think that possible that we'll continue to see some inflation there. The other factor is, we're certainly seeing inflation, when it comes to the performance based compensation that we have. With our improving financial results, we're going to see increases there as well. And that's something that really gets back to when we talk about our focus for hiring people. It all starts with our company culture and the family spirit that we have. That certainly has made it easier to both attract and retain employees. But the connection to the financial performance, and that direct link of the engagement of employees with connecting the company's financial success to their personal success through improved wages and benefits and contributions into our 401-K retirement program. Those are all things that helped keep driving the performance of the company. So those will continue to increase as the financial performance, both revenue and income are increasing as well. But I think we're in a great spot. And to keep getting some leverage. If we see that salary, wages and benefits line, there should be some natural inflation there too, is we in-source, and reduce our reliance on purchase transportation. So there shouldn't be some corresponding decreases once we kind of catch back up to the curve there. So multiple factors that's going to be driving that number for us. That 25% reflects the door capacity that we have in our network. In an LTL network, it's the doors that is required to process freight. And it's obviously very critical and a long term investment and a long time to expand capacity, as we've discussed earlier on the call. So, that's something that we always have to stay focused on. And we feel like far ahead of our growth curve to make sure the network is never a limiting factor to us. But that's one of three key elements of capacity within LTL. Next would be on the fleet side. And I feel like we're in a really good spot, based on where our fleet is and the ability to handle the freight that we have today, as well as the ongoing increases that we would be anticipating this year. In coordination with the $290 million CapEx spend that we have planned for equipment this year. So I feel like our fleets in a really good spot. And obviously, you don't want to carry that much excess capacity like we do on the service center network side in your fleet, there's higher deer depreciation per unit cost there. You want to have enough to be able to handle the peaks at the end of the month and the end of quarters and to be able to accommodate growth. But you don't maintain that same excessive level. And then finally, and most importantly, is the people capacity. And certainly, that's something that we manage more in relation with revenue and volume trends. And it's something that we're constantly balancing here. And the lever we pull, like we're pulling right now, when we're a little short is we make use of purchase transportation. And we'll continue to do that until we complete the additions to the team that just sort of catch up with the freight volumes that we're currently experiencing. So, we're in a good spot across the board. And I think we've got a good plan, a very detailed plan and is different by service center and by region for how we're continuing to add drivers and platform employees to the team to continue to handle the accelerating volumes that we're seeing. Yes. Sure, Scott. We were actually in the process of making a couple purchases to do some testing. We still from everything we see and hear that technology is not where it needs to be to help us at this point, but we are wanting to test some electric vehicles. Be it switchers, be it trucks or -- and/or forklifts. So that's in the process as we speak. But, again, I don't see any impact of that in the near future. Any impact I'm saying from electric. Yes. On the electric side, right? April, was definitely the worst period that we experienced last year. That was the biggest drop that was just like freight and revenue levels fell off a cliff. And once things reset, we had pretty good recovery and sequentially increases for the most part that point forward. But from a revenue trend standpoint, in April, we were down 19.3% on a per day basis, like I mentioned in May, we were down -- May of 2020, we were down 16.2%. In June of 2020, we were down 11.5%. So each month, the change -- I guess the comp gets a little more difficult, but just reflects sequential improvements that we saw. Overall revenue for the quarter was down 15.5% second quarter of 2020. 15% tonnage, Tom, that's pretty steep. I'm not sure I recall those days. Maybe my memory seems. But we had 15 in 2018. But anyway, that's a pretty steep. We'll see it obviously, in the second quarter when we were so far back in 2020. But I'm not sure once we get back to normal type comparisons, we're going to see that kind of growth, that's probably a stretch. And to be clear, on that percent capacity, that's not a year over year growth. I mean, that's, that's capacity from the freight levels that we're handling here in March in the first quarter. Incremental growth on top of that, while we're also continuing to expand every day. It's hard to ramp up, Tom at that pace. I mean, obviously, if we knew we were anticipating that. If that was realistic, then it would certainly be more realistic, but I'm not sure, we'll see that those type numbers. I'm not sure the economy's quite that strong. While things are certainly good and positive. That 15% is a bit over where we are today.  Got to remember right, we just came off the rim. I just wanted to mention, reiterate, we came off the highest revenue quarter we've ever had in the first quarter. So you're talking about big numbers, bigger numbers on top of big numbers, if you will. And he's in obviously ignoring the year over year column. That's much easier Again, second quarter, we'll have some impressive numbers. I would certainly expect. But we get in the, like I say, more normal comparisons. I don't think we'll see that. The first and fourth quarters are more normalized versus the middle part of the year, where we've got some easier comps. Thanks, Tom. I don't know that we've seen that. Jordan, I don't know that we've seen that at all. I expect some of them are trying to do something. But we haven't seen a whole lot of movement for the most part. We see -- every now and again, you'll see some carriers adding a terminal here and there. But like I mentioned earlier, when we look over a longer period of time, the reality is, there's been more of a decrease in the number of service centers in operation around the country versus we obviously have been focused on increasing. And we're doing that because of the market share opportunities that we continue to believe that are out there. And certainly we're positioned better than anyone with the service levels that we offer, the total value proposition. And we feel like that in this environment, more shippers are focusing on value, that's certainly what we sail. And there is a value to Old Dominion services, as well as the capacity. Our customers right now are certainly benefiting from the fact that we've made all of these capacity investments and they've got contracts in place with us. And we certainly can continue to handle increased levels of business with them. And we're getting the feedback from customers that many of our competitors are not able to handle some of the acceleration that they're seeing in their business. So that, too, is we have seen in the first quarter. And that's continuing where that capacity advantages is certainly driving freight our way. So anecdotally, feedback that we're getting from customers as well as just what we see in terms of total service centers and operation, on average, they are down. And we are benefiting from that at a time when we think the industry continues to have tailwinds. And that's just creating more and more opportunity for Old Dominion. I don't think it's a change in strategy at all. Its this the strategy we've been talking about for a long time. And like I've mentioned before, and we've talked about over the years, we will grow more when the economy is strong. And when our competitors capacity is as limited as it appears to be, then the customers come to us. And that's what we've seen happening in recent months. And I expect that we will certainly have much stronger growth than most all of our competitors. So, we're waiting to see, but it's not any anything that we've done, the change. Is just the continued execution of the strategy that we set forth back some years ago. And like I said, before, we're executing and having success doing so. I feel good about where we are and the things that we've done. And now its the time when it starts to pay off for us. Yes. Pretty positive from that standpoint, for sure. I assume you're talking about robots and that kind of thing? Not that we've seen. Not at this point in time. Thank you. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thank you and have a great day."

            "name": "Adam Satterfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.1 billion, which was a 14.1% increase from the prior year despite having one less work day. Our operating ratio improved 530 basis points to 76.1% and earnings per diluted share increase to $1.70. Our per day revenue growth of 15.9% included a nice mix of increases in both our LTL tons and yield. LTL tons per day increased 10%, while our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 5.6%. We are winning market share as demand for our industry leading service has increased while the domestic economy is improving. In addition to our service advantage that includes 99% on time performance and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%, our proven strategy of investing and service center capacity ahead of anticipated growth has also provided us with a capacity advantage in the marketplace. This strategy is different for many of our competitors, as we believe the average number of service centers operated by the other large LTL carriers has decreased over the past 10 years. We currently have approximately 25% excess capacity within our service center network, which is in line with our long term targets and we plan to further expand our network this year to stay ahead of our growth. Our plan is to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to growth. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increase 3.3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.5%. These were all above our normal sequential trends, which typically declined from the fourth quarter. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows; January increased 0.3% as compared with December, February decreased 4.4% versus January, and March increased 10.7% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 2.2% in February, and an increase of 5.1% in March. While there are still many workdays that remain in April, our revenue performance has remained strong. Our month to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 45% to 50% when compared to April of 2020. As a reminder, our revenue decreased 19.3% in April 2020, due to the significant impact of the COVID related shutdowns. We will provide the actual revenue related details for April in our first quarter form 10-Q. Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 76.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. We have said many times before that the long term improvement or operating ratio requires an improvement in density and yield, both of which are generally supported by a favorable macro economic environment. The strength of our first quarter results reflect how important these factors are to our success. Our direct costs benefited from an improvement in our line-haul laden-load average and pick up delivery shipments per hour during the quarter. We lost a little productivity on the dock. But that is common when business levels accelerate and we add a significant number of new employees. While we would like to see our platform productivity improved, we believe it is more important for these employees to properly load our trailers to maximize employee safety in line-haul efficiency, while also protecting free from damage. As Greg mentioned, we will continue to add drivers and platform employees during the second quarter as our volume trends continue to accelerate. We will also continue to use purchase transportation to supplement our workforce until the capacity of our team can support our anticipated growth. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter primarily by successfully leveraging a revenue growth. As expected and mentioned on our fourth quarter call, certain calls that were reduced in 2020 because of the pandemic have started to increase. While many of these calls such as travel and customer entertainment are not completely back to pre-pandemic levels. We expect that there will be sequential increases in aggregate overhead costs this year. We will maintain our disciplined approach to controlling discretionary spending however, and make every effort to minimize cost inflation and other areas. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations total $310.3 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $51 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $605 million this year, which includes $275 million for service center expansion projects. We utilize $309 million for our share repurchase program and paid $23.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total share repurchase amount includes $275 million attributable to an accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter. Our first quarter shares outstanding reflects the initial delivery of shares under this Agreement, and a final calculation of total shares. repurchased will occur no later than the end of August of this year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2021 was 26.0% as compared to 26.3% in the first quarter of 2020. And we currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter of 2021. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we would be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. And it's hard to get into the details of that on tonnage and shipments basis, because the trends have been a little more or unusual, if you will, and not following the same types of patterns in the sense of the way -- our weight per shipment has been trending intra month and so forth. We've been seeing some wider shipments earlier in the month, and then it just strengthens throughout and then gets heavy at the end. But nevertheless, our overall revenue, obviously 45% to 50% on a comparison basis with April suggests that we are seeing continued strength and acceleration in our business. We had incredibly strong performance in March, at tonnage per day, that was up 10.7% versus the normal 5.1% increase, that was the 10-year average. And then that followed the weakness that we saw in February. So probably, a little bit of recovery there, that helps support that number. And then just the way the math work. But I think that we're continuing to see revenue perform pretty much in line with what we'd expect from a sequential standpoint. As you mentioned, the year-over-year weights and shipments are going to look a little unusual. Whereas last year, we had such an increase in late March and through April, and the weight per shipment. So that certainly will throw things off a bit. But we'd look to see continued strong revenue performance, and whether that's coming through in tonnage, shipments and yield, I think it's really all of the above. They're all performing well, and contributing to excellent revenue quality, and obviously in the first quarter that's contributing to really strong profitable growth force. Yes. The yield numbers is similar to conversation we just had about volume. They're going to look a little unusual as well. Last year in April, our average weight per shipment was 1677 pounds.. And we've been trending now around the 1600 pound range. So we're going to see, if things continue a pretty meaningful drop, and that similar to what we experienced in March as well. So you can with a big decrease in the weight per shipment, obviously that has a favorable impact on revenue per hundredweight. And so we've got a big inflection there. Not to mention that last year in April was when the fuel dropped significantly. So we're going to have a bigger contribution from the fuel surcharge as well. You might be looking at and certainly we saw double digit type increase in revenue per hundredweight. And that doesn't tell the story necessarily from a pure yield and revenue per shipment standpoint. And we saw a nice improvement in the first quarter on revenue per shipment. And that benefited from both higher weight per shipment and a higher length of haul as well. And all those metrics go into our yield management process. We've got a process that's focused on individual account profitability, and one that focuses on continuous improvement as well. And I think that our sales team, our pricing teams, they've worked really hard over the last couple of years, to make sure that we're seeing continuous improvement in each of our customers operating ratios. And that's certainly bearing fruit when you look at our numbers and how that may transition into the second quarter as well. So, it's probably going to be more of just looking at that pure number. Look and comparison on a sequential basis from first quarter revenue per hundredweight that I know drive everyone's models in that normal sequential transition from 1Q to 2Q. And if you look at it excluding the field, we were right at $21 on a revenue per hundredweight basis in 1Q. And typically, we see, an average about 1.5% increase from 1Q to 2Q if mix is held constant. So that would suggest another $0.25 to $0.30 sort of sequential increase, if you will, and that revenue per hundredweight metric excluding the fuel. But we're going to continue on with our focus and you asked about OpEx as well. The long term plan has always been to balance our revenue per shipment versus the cost per shipment performance and having a positive delta there to support the ongoing investments and capacity that essentially we're making on behalf of our customers, As well as investments in technology, tools and so forth. It can help us keep our cost structure lower, so that we can improve profit per shipment, without having to rely completely on pricing initiatives. But if we can continue to keep costs in check through productivity, and certainly right now, we're benefiting from the strong top line growth and just the increase in shipment is creating operating leverage that that's benefiting our cost structure there. And, as you mentioned, we did see a decrease in cost per shipment in the first quarter. But we were expecting, like we mentioned at the beginning of this year, core inflation of kind of 4% to 4.5%. We're just benefiting right now significantly from the leverage and productivity, yield performance in our business. Yes. It's certainly. I mean, that's the quarter where we get the biggest improvement. It's the quarter where we typically see the largest sequential increase in revenue performance as well. Typically, revenue per day is up 10% in the second quarter versus the first. And so, that leverage on existing cost base and so forth creates that opportunity for us. So -- we've -- on any given year, we've increased or improved the operating ratio in a range of 360 to 420 basis points. And certainly, we would expect to get some improvement this year. We've done a good job the last three quarters and have had nice sequential changes that have been kind of what our normal progression is. But now, we're starting to look at the cost that you mentioned that we expect to have some increases in our aggregate overhead costs. We performed very well in the first quarter and had some costs in categories that kind of went well for us. That we'll see if all the stars stay aligned as we transitioned in the second quarter. But certainly, our focus is always to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And we will continue to look at it, leveraging the improvement in our revenue and trying to continue with our productivity initiatives. Some of that, like we saw in the first quarter, where we lost a little productivity on the dock, as we continue to hire new employees and put them into the operation. Certainly, you can start seeing a little bit of headwind on productivity there. But our operation is running extremely smooth right now. And we're going to keep focused on making sure that we're focused mainly on keeping our service metrics best-in-class, secondary focus on productivity. But at the end of the day, we're trying to produce as much profitable growth as we can. And on the labor inflation standpoint, we gave our wage increase in September of last year. We would not expect -- or we're seeing the effects of that. And that was part of that overall core inflation of 4% to 4.5%. That was probably, all in 3% to 3.5%. So we're seeing that until September of this coming year on just pure inflation standpoint. But we are continuing to use the purchase transportation, though, and that amount stayed pretty much in the same range as where it was in the fourth quarter. And we talked about, hoping to see that number decline as we progress through the second quarter. And at this point, it's staying at the same level. So we'll keep using that supplement, the workforce until really we're in position to be able to handle anticipated growth with our complete team and everything in sourced where we would like it to be. But that's probably, we expect to still see PTE [ph] decrease on the second half, but just may be a little bit later in the year. But really the goal will be getting the workforce where it needs to be not only for this year, but really just gearing up and preparing for 2022. Yes. It's been something where a lot of those shipments end up coming through our spot quote network and spot quote type business and other volume shipments. And in the past have been anywhere from 3% to 5% of our revenue. Right now, they're probably only 1% to 2% of revenue. So, we certainly have seen a decrease. Now, with that said, some of those -- some shippers, especially the larger accounts, when our weight per shipment increased last year, they just move heavier type shipments on their contractual rates. So some of that is transparent to us that a customer may have tried to move 6,000 pounds shipment by a truckload, if they could have found a carrier that may have performed a multi stop for them. So, it's not always clear. But what's clear is just us trying to understand all of the freight movement characteristics, the costing for each shipment, and the revenue that we need to have on each shipment that we move. I think that, the 1600 pound range, where we are, I think really reflects the strength of the economy, typically an increase in weight per shipment goes hand in hand with an improving economy. And to think about what I just mentioned, with the decrease in the number of spot quote shipments, oftentimes a spot quote shipments are averaging 8,000 to 10,000 pounds. So when you've got that mix of business that has now shifted into a percentage of business rather than shifted into our 559 tariff base customers and our larger contractual customers, I think it just reflects the underlying demand for our customers businesses. But we've seen really good performance with our smaller accounts. In recent months, our tariff based business is continuing to improve as a result and actually is trending slightly ahead as a percent of overall revenue than where we were pre pandemic. And then our contractual accounts, which performed well for us all last year, continuing to perform strongly as well. And so they actually are, are picking up a little bit more as well. And we're just seeing the higher balance in both of those categories versus that decrease in the mix from the spot quote. So it's good to see across the board, that when we look at our accounts, and think through that the increase in weight per shipment kind of goes hand in hand with the feedback that we're getting from our sales team that our customers businesses are improving. And there's just the increased demand for widgets out there that's creating freight opportunities for us. And certainly, we're taking advantage of that opportunity with our market share improvements. Well, obviously, from a top line basis, it's finally going to be turning for us, in the sense of for most of last year we faced the headwind with fuel prices being down in March. It turned if you will. And at this point, we're looking at fuel prices that are about 25% or so higher than where they were in April of last year. So that'll be a good thing from a top line standpoint for us. From a bottom line standpoint, much like we talked about last year, we tried to have our fuel scales, both for our own internal scale, as well as the scales that many of our larger contractual accounts have within their contracts to be somewhat neutral, whether fuel is going up or down, and we stress test those. But we didn't really talk too much about it. Last year, we felt -- when it was decreasing, we felt like, we would minimize the effect on the bottom line, based on the lower end of the fuel scales. And certainly now that it's showing a year over year increase, we'd hope to minimize the effect on the bottom line as well. But just keep managing through that on a customer by customer basis. And looking at what the revenue inputs are, and the cost inputs are to maximize profitability. Yes. On the autonomous piece, that's something that we feel like that technology is continuing to develop, and we'll continue to look at things. From a regulatory standpoint. I don't know that we ever, it's hard to envision seeing the driverless vehicle on the road, sharing the roadways with passenger autos. But we think that as the technology improves, that it will continue to drive improvements in safety. And certainly could drive some incremental benefit as well. But the technology may get there before it's really allowed from a regulatory standpoint. But something that we'll continue to watch. And obviously is, I think we've got one of the youngest fleets in the industry and are investing year in and year out, we always want to look at whatever safety or efficiency tools are available to us. And we've got the financial strength and ability to invest as those become available, and we feel like are practical to implement within our operation and certainly would be on board with taking advantage of whatever opportunities the manufacturers can come up with."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we would be glad to take your questions. The Old Dominion team produced fourth quarter financial results that allowed us to finish the year with company records for annual revenue and profitability. We extended our track record of success and delivered the 10th straight quarter with both an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2022 was also the 10th straight quarter where we produced double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our team produced these results while facing many challenges during 2022, which were primarily related to the unexpected slowdown in the domestic economy. We entered the year anticipating growth in our volumes that didn't ultimately meet our initial expectations. But we made the necessary adjustments throughout the year that once again showed the flexibility and resiliency of our long-term strategic plan. We also maintained a watchful eye on the efficiency of our operations and continued with our disciplined approach to managing discretionary spending. Due to our confidence in our ability to win market share over the long-term, one thing that did not change in 2022 was our commitment to investing for the future. Capital expenditures, totaling $775.1 million in 2022, were a new company record. And we invested $299.5 million in real estate projects that further expanded the capacity of our service center network. We also continued to invest heavily in our OD Family of employees, with improvements in pay and benefits, as well as a company record contribution to our 401(k) retirement plan for employees. In dealing with the reality of slower than anticipated business volumes we also work diligently to protect the significant investments that we made over the past two years in our new employees. Thinking of new employees, I am proud to share that there have been over 1,300 new drivers that graduated from our internal truck driving school over the past two years. And in some cases, these driver school graduates that now have their CDLs are temporarily working on non-driving roles. While this comes at an increased cost to the company, we believe this bigger pool of licensed drivers will provide us with the strategic advantage once the freight cycle turns and additional volume opportunities become available to us. We said in our third quarter earnings call that we anticipated volumes could start increasing in the spring of this year. And we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that this will occur despite ongoing risk with the domestic economy. Regardless of the economic environment, I believe our 2022 results provide yet another example of why our long-term strategic plan will remain our focus for the foreseeable future. Consistent execution of this plan had helped us create an unmatched value proposition in our industry that led to over $1 billion of revenue growth for the second straight year, in 2022. I am confident that this commitment to our strategic plan will also continue after my retirement at the end of June, this year. Our long-term success is the result of a strong team and their combined commitment to maintaining a strong company culture. After working with Marty for most of my career, I can tell you that he lives and breathes the OD Family spirit, and will help take the company to new heights. I think the best is yet to come for Old Dominion. And I look forward to watching OD expand its long-term record of success. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, here is Marty Freeman to provide some more details on the fourth quarter.\nMarty Freeman: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. I would like to start today by thanking Greg and our Board of Directors for providing me the opportunity to lead this great company. It will be an honor to lead our team. And I can assure you that we will work tirelessly to keep producing strong profitable growth. Along those lines, I was pleased with Old Dominion's revenue growth of 5.8%, and the improvement in our operating ratio to 71.2% during the fourth quarter. The combination of these items contributed to the 21.2% increase in earnings per diluted share. These financial results reflect the ongoing strength and demand for our services as we continue to deliver value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. While our long-term strategic plan is centered on our ability to provide this value proposition, the real key to our success is our strong family culture and our people. We will continue to invest in our OD Family of employees as our employees are the foundation for building strong customer relationships. We are in a relationship business, and each employee plays a critical role to help deliver our industry-leading service. I am proud to report that our service metrics remained strong during the fourth quarter as we provided 99% on-time service, with a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. We believe executing our same long-term formula for success will allow us to win market share in the future. And as a result, we will -- also will allow us to constantly advance to new capacity ahead of anticipated growth. Our capital expenditures for 2023 are anticipated to be $800 million, which will improve the average age of our fleet and further expand the capacity of our real estate network. We have invested approximately $2 billion in real estate expansion over the last 10 years, and increased our door capacity by approximately 50% as a result. These investments supported our ability to double our market share over this time. The ever-increasing cost of both real estate and equipment, however, will require us to maintain our pricing discipline. Our long-term pricing philosophy is designed to evaluate the profitability of each customer account, and then obtain the necessary increases to offset our cost inflation, while also supporting our ongoing investment in capacity and technology. As we have executed on this consistent strategy over the years, the resulting improvement in our cash flow has generally supported our ability to invest between 10% and 15% of our revenue into capital expenditures each year. Continuing with each of these priorities demonstrates our team's intention to remain focused on executing the same business strategies that we have created our unique position in this industry. We will continue to focus on our people, servicing our customers, and investing for the future. This commitment to the core principles have differentiated us in the marketplace, gives us confidence in our ability to further produce profitable growth, while also increasing shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn things over to Adam who will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth, of 5.8% in the fourth quarter, resulted from a 16.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 9.1% decrease in LTL tons. LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 8.7% and reflects the continued execution of our long-term pricing initiatives. Our consistent approach to pricing is supported by our ability to provide our customers with superior service and available capacity. We believe this value offering is becoming increasingly important to shipper, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter decreased 2.4% when compared to the third quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 4.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.3% in tons per day, and a decrease of 3.3% in shipments per day. For January, our revenue per day increased approximately 4.2% as compared to January of 2022. This growth included a 13.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 7.8% decrease in the LTL tons per day. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 71.2%, which is primarily due to an improvement in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating cost, productive labor as a percent of revenue improved 170 basis points, which our purchase transportation costs improved 200 basis points. These changes more than offset the 260 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that primarily resulted from a significant increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products during the quarter. Our overhead costs as a percent of revenue were consistent between the periods compared. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $361.3 million and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $270.4 million and $775.1 million for the same periods. As Marty mentioned, we currently expect capital expenditures of $800 million in 2023. We utilized $199.9 million and $1.3 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.0 million and $134.5 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for the first quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate for both fourth quarter 2022 and 2021 was 25.0%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi, good morning. Question, so on the salary expense side of the equation for the fourth quarter, I think the dollar amount was actually down year-over-year. Can you maybe talk a little bit to your thoughts around the drivers of that, just a lower incentive comp, I think I you had mentioned attrition? And then how do we think about the salary line going forward, whether it be on a wage inflation perspective or a growth perspective? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. The overall dollars, obviously, we've been making adjustments as we've gone through the year. And I would say through the back-half of the year, in particular, we've been letting attrition take place, and just consistently adjusting our headcount and the hours worked by our people in relation to what the volume environment dictates to continue to give service by continuing to operate efficiently. And so, I think, overall, that helped drive the decrease in that quarter-over-quarter, those expenses, if you will. So, we continue to be focused, obviously, on managing those costs. That's our biggest cost element of our business is in the salaries, wages, and benefits. And so, it's certainly the biggest area of focus as we try to continue to run our network as efficiently as possible without giving any sacrifice to service. So, I do think that given the environment in the fourth quarter, I think we had, given the circumstance, is pretty strong revenue performance. So, I was pleased with the way our revenue and volumes trended. And that was probably one of the favorable line items, if you will, in comparison to the guidance that we had originally provided with respect to the operation ratio, was how the salary, wages, and benefits ended up coming in for us.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, is there a way to -- I mean, do you expect that type of control, at least for the first-half, until you get to that inflection, in the spring, in volumes? I mean, could we continue to see that trend line stay the same for the time being?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think we're in a good spot right now with where our headcount is. And typically, we start seeing increases in volume. And certainly, we're not in a normal environment by any stretch. But our January volumes were slightly positive versus December, pretty flattish overall, really when you look at it from a shipment perspective. But we continue to anticipate that we will see volumes return to us in the spring. And I think we want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to deal with that environment whenever it inevitably comes. We're certainly very confident about what our future market share opportunities will be. And so, we want to make sure that we're in a position with our people, our equipment, and certainly our service and our network to be able to effectively respond when that does happen. Typically, the February volumes are a little bit higher than January. And it's March when we start seeing the increase coming. And so, I think that what we're trying to do is just, again, measure and manage all elements of capacity to ensure that we're in a good spot when that happens. So, again, I think that certainly a lot in the first quarter and probably the first-half of the year really depends on what the volume environment gives us. But we continue to believe that we are going to see some increase. We've certainly seen it in the past, even in down economic environments, whether you look at something as bad as the environment was in 2009. I think 2016 is another good example, where our second quarter volumes were higher than the first. And so, it'll be a little different situation, I think, playing out this year in comparison to 2022, when, beginning with April, our volumes were either decreasing or flattish on a month-over-month basis as we worked our way through the year. Certainly, we'd like to see volumes flowing into us as we transition and make our way through 2023. And hopefully start getting a little help from the macroeconomic environment as well.\nJordan Alliger: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Thank you. Greg, congratulations on your retirement, and I think the $34 billion of shareholder value you've created since you've been CEO. Congrats on that. And Marty, you've got some big shoes to fill, but congratulations to you as well.\nMarty Freeman: Thank you, Jack. He taught me well.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Jack. Appreciate the kind words.\nJack Atkins: Absolutely.\nGreg Gantt: And it's been a good run.\nJack Atkins: Absolutely has been. So, I guess maybe if we could -- Adam, if you could maybe expand a bit on the January trends a bit more. You talked about January being up a bit or maybe even flattish versus December. Anything you feel comfortable sharing there in terms of January revenue trends and tonnage or shipments trends, that'd be helpful? And then, I guess, as you think about the operation ratio, first quarter versus fourth quarter, anything you can maybe share relative to normal seasonality would be helpful there? So, I'll turn it over to you, Adam.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I guess from a volume standpoint on a year-over-year basis, January, our tons per day were down 7.8% that compares to December where we were down 12.3% overall. I would point out and obviously we will continue to give our mid quarter updates. We have a little bit easier comparison with the January year-over-year comp, and we had very strong performance in February of last year. So, that kind of gets a little bit more difficult there. And then, they obviously start getting easier. So, I guess be aware of that when we give that February update in a month or so. But nevertheless, I was pretty pleased with the way really going back through the fourth quarter. December came in a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential change is. And that's the month we kind of talked about I think on the last call in the fourth quarter in particular in some slower economic environment is where we have seen pretty hefty drop-off in our business levels. And the fact that we stayed pretty steady rather I think was a positive takeaway for me. I was hoping that we would see our sequential performance from a volume standpoint to be a little closer to our 10-year average trends. And certainly, it was. The fourth quarter volumes were down 4.4% sequentially, the normal changes of 1.3% decrease. But if we compare back to where we were in the second and third quarters relative to our 10-year average changes, I think, we are starting to trend back in the right direction, and whether or not we get back to the full 10-year average at least in the first-half of the year remains to be seen. I think we probably need a little bit stronger economy. But I do think that we are going to start seeing some increases like we mentioned particularly starting in March and then continuing through the second quarter. And then, we will see where things go from there. But I think that certainly that volume environment really will dictate what the operating ratio does typically just to give a little bit more color on the first quarter operating ratio. We typically have about a 100 basis point increase there coming off the fourth quarter. In this particular first quarter of 2023, we did have a favorable insurance adjustment. We have talked on -- and given the guidance for 4Q assuming that line held steady. There was improvement there. And I think that that will normalize back to around 1.2% of revenue in 1Q of 23. So, that's becomes a 70 basis point or so headwind for us. I think that we are going to continue to see a little bit of a headwind from depreciation as well. We have talked about this as we worked our way through last year that our delivery cycle was a little bit different than prior year. And so, we are probably going to see a little bit more headwind from here. So, on a normalized basis that probably puts us at about 200 basis point increase. So, we are where we just finished the fourth quarter. But -- so, that kind of puts us somewhat flattish if you will on a year-over-year basis if we were to hit that. And certainly, I think if we get better revenue performance, we have got the opportunity to be able to outperform that longer term normalized average. But I think the revenue environment will certainly control a lot of it for us.\nJack Atkins: Okay, very helpful. Thanks again.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Jack.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Following up on the waiver fees, your headcount was down about 3% sequentially. I think that's the biggest decline besides the COVID 2Q '20 jobs that you had since you began reporting this on a quarterly basis. You talked a little bit earlier in one of the other questions about feeling you are in a fairly good place. Can you elaborate a little more? Does that mean your headcount flat to up from here, or flattish and then trend with volumes from here? And just to help put a finer point on that, any commentary on productivity or the cost of heads -- I don't know, labor cost for employer, any other guidance you can get to help us kind of frame the cost piece of that in the expectation? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Basc. And this is Greg. But I will take that and try to give you as much color only as possible. But obviously we made some adjustments where we felt like we needed to in headcount. And as Adam mentioned earlier, we talked about attrition. And we have kind of let attrition control some of these adjustments. But we have made some in other places where we needed to. Certainly, we haven't replaced openings likely typically would in a normal cycle where we are growing and what not. But -- and that will continue to be our efforts still thanks to our return of the other ways. So, we will see typically -- we will see a little uptick late February. Going into March, things really start to pickup. So, is that going to be the trend this year? We hope so, but just not absolutely certain. But I think we are in a good spot because as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we've got an awful lot of qualified drivers that we have got work on the platform and what not. They are not driving full time. So, I think we will certainly be ready when the increase does happen, you know, hope it's sooner than later, but definitely we will continue to make adjustments as needed. We talked about this on some of our prior calls. We have been able to make these adjustments in downturns in the past. I think we pretty began we can make adjustments when we need to. We have done it again. We feel good about where we are. We just have to continue to stay on top of it and react as the business dictates. I hope that helps.\nBascome Majors: No, it's fairly helpful. To maybe cap that off, any thoughts on items that could impact kind of the cost per head this year? I don't know if there are some variables on incentive comp or other things that might make little bit lengthy versus what we would deem a normal trip based on history? Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Not that I know of, Basc, and don't think so. I think it should be fairly normal from that standpoint. We certainly had some good experiences in the recent past with our benefit cost and those kinds of things. So, you just hope that those things continue to be consistent and don't turn the other way for some or no reason.\nBascome Majors: Thank you, Greg.\nGreg Gantt: Sure thing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good morning, and congratulations also to both of you Greg and Marty. And Greg, yes, just a remarkable run. So, congratulations on the great performance over time. Let's see -- I think -- I guess just in terms of the view on tonnage. I know you have a large customer base. So, maybe it's tough to pars it out. But what would you say about I guess dynamic in terms of volume from retail customers and volume from industrial customers? It seems like probably there has been a lot of weakness and focus on inventory reduction with retail customers. Maybe little less clear what's happened with industrial? So, just trying to think about is there potentially some weakness yet to come with industrial? Have you seen pretty big difference in the volumes from those two groups? And so, kind of any thoughts on that topic would be helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, Tom. I would say during the fourth quarter we saw a pretty consistent revenue performance with both our industrial customer base and our retail customer base. I would say earlier part of the year we had seen a little bit stronger performance on the industrial side. And those two kind of converged, if you will, in the fourth quarter. Obviously, our customer bases leans more industrial than retail. We are still 55% to 60% industrial overall and 25% to 30% or so on the retail side. In longer term that retail business has been growing faster than the industrial. And I think that reflects some of the ecommerce trends and the effects of those on our customer supply chains. And we certainly continue to believe that that will be a longer term tailwind for us. And I think that as we start working through 2023. And we believe that we will start seeing customer's orders for their products picking up and some inventory rebalancing if you will. And I think that's why we've seen in some of the prior slow period that I spoke of earlier why you start seeing that orders and freight flows kind of leading the other macroeconomic indicator. So, we believe that the freight cycle will starting turning. And we will start seeing some pick up. And it's through these customer interactions and conversations that, that support our belief that we're going to start seeing freight flow, and again, as we get into March and into the second quarter.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, but it sounds like you haven't seen a big difference, maybe over the past, in 4Q or even 3Q, in performance from industrial and retail, and I guess looking forward, you think maybe both of them kind of bottom and improve at the same time.\nGreg Gantt: And maybe we start seeing retail outperform again, while I assume, and some of the industrial numbers look a little bit weaker, we start getting some of that retail performance as an offset, leading us out and eventually we'll start seeing the industrial picking back up again.\nTom Wadewitz: Right, okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Yes, congrats. Absolutely to Greg and Marty, it's been a heck of a run, certainly, Greg. When I guess I wanted to talk a little bit about how you guys are planning for the potential improvement in tonnage that you may see in the spring, you guys have always been very good at being out in front of potential opportunities. But do you think that there are incremental costs that need to come on the network. Before that happens, are you fairly comfortable being able to sort of let tonnage lead you out of this to drive incremental margins, which obviously, you guys have performed quite well with over time?\nGreg Gantt: Yes, I think that, Chris, that some of the conversation earlier about headcount, probably on paper, we may be a little bit heavy now, if you just look at things statistically, if you will. But that's kind of the point of the, what we've said is, I think that we're in a good spot, with our headcount with our fleet, and certainly with the service center network to be able to let volume start flowing again. And when we talk about increases, just keep in mind that we're talking about sequential increases, and certainly with the year-over-year comps, particularly in the first-half of the year, we've got some tougher year-over-year comparisons there before we get back to, does being able to show year-over-year growth. But I think that'll be the important thing for us to continue to watch is, are we seeing those types of sequential increases? And certainly we've got a lot of flexibility within our workforce. And I think that, given the team that we have, and the current levels, we should be able to respond to growth when it starts coming at us and get some good leverage, as it does. But certainly we're looking at right now in the first quarter. Like I mentioned, with the January tonnage levels, we've got probably the volumes that are going to be the toughest comp, and certainly, overall, the fourth quarter we were down 9.1%. Our yield performance is still looking good. And we certainly expect to continue to push for core yield increases this year to offset our cost inflation, as well. But there could become some converging factors, if you will, that drive the top line, depending on what the overall fuel environment looks like, and so forth. But we're certainly going to continue to look and execute on the same pricing philosophy that we have in the past and look for cost plus increases to offset the cost inflation that we see in the business and to keep supporting these expensive investments that we're making in our real estate network and technologies that can both improve customer service, but also drive further operating efficiencies for us. So, a lot of things to kind of manage through it particularly the first-half of this year, but I think we're in a good spot to be able to handle the volumes if they do backflow our way.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes, that's very helpful. I appreciate that, that color. On the point of pricing, just to follow-up, ex-fuel yield did accelerate, the year-over-year growth that accelerate in the fourth quarter, and I guess they're guiding the first quarter or roughly speaking to around flattish which may coincide with the worst tonnage, you're going to see from a year-over-year standpoint. So, when you take a step back and think about 2023, more broadly, is OR expansion on the table, given those circumstances is pricing good enough to be able to offset inflation as we go and tonnage potentially gets less worse as the year progresses?\nGreg Gantt: Well, I think that again, the revenue environment will have a lot to say about that, more broadly speaking, we've talked and kind of pointed everyone to our performance in 2016 and 2019, when we've been in a flatter revenue environment, certainly, given the planned investment of about $800 million in capital expenditures this year. And with some pressures that we'll see on depreciation, starting earlier in the year than normal, we will have some pressures, if you will, on those overhead costs. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter already where overhead costs as a percent of revenue were flat in 4Q '22 versus 4Q '21. But like we did in '16 and in '19, the focus when we're in a flat to a down revenue environment will be managing our variable costs flat, and we'd love to see improvement, but trying to hold all those costs flat. And then, any deterioration if there is anything would be in those overhead costs in particular, on the depreciation side. And so, I think that in '16, we certainly saw a little bit of a decrease in the operating ratio or an increase, rather depending on how you look at it. But I think our operating ratio deteriorated 60 basis points that year. And that was something that was right in line with the change in the depreciation line item. And then, '19 was the same thing, where we had 30 basis points deterioration there. So, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter, certainly, and we'll talk as we get to the end of next quarter's call about what we think we may be able to do in 2Q, but certainly feel like we're probably going to have a little bit more pressure on the overhead side this year if we are in fact a flat to slightly down revenue environment, but there's still a lot up in the air when it comes to the top line for this year.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys, and again, congrats, Greg and Marty. I was wondering, can you give us some of the yields ex-fuel accelerated in Q4, is any color, is underlying pricing accelerating here? And then, Adam, I think you talked about 13% total yield growth in January, anyway you can just help us on the gross and on the net of fuel, I just want to understand that that net of fuel is continuing to accelerate? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, net of fuel in January was about 8.5%. So, fairly consistent with what we just did in the fourth quarter overall. And we are starting to see a decrease in fuel. And we'll see how that continues to trend this year. And so, perhaps the yield with and without the fuel, those two numbers will maybe be a little bit more consistent. I think that fuel hold steady with where we are right now, it certainly becomes a headwind as we get into the later quarters of the year, but nonetheless, I think that certainly there's always mix changes that can drive that number, higher or lower. But I think it's pretty consistent with what our long-term philosophy has been. We certainly dealt with higher cost inflation on a per shipment basis in 2022 than then what at least I initially expected I thought we would see some cost moderation as we got into the back-half of the year, which obviously did not happen. So, we just continue to execute on that same consistent philosophy that we always have. And I think that's why we saw that the yield performance that we did, but I believe that call should be a little bit more favorable versus the last couple of years. And 2023 are certainly that's our hope. And we'll continue to build our cost model around what that cost inflation expectation is and then continue to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread above that inflation to again support the investments that we're going to make. So, I think overall, if you did sort of roll out typically the first quarter our yield metrics are up about 0.5% over the fourth quarter. We'd expect to continue to see if mix is constant. Those numbers increase sequentially quarter-after-quarter, but certainly that some of that, that growth if you will may start to moderate a bit but again you're going to see that same type of moderation or should, what the costs. But nonetheless, the overall philosophy stays the same, and we'll continue to look for cost plus pricing.\nScott Group: Very helpful. And just because you mentioned the fuel, and maybe the surcharge revenue and flex negative, how does that impact your thoughts on the question earlier about operating ratio improvement this year?\nGreg Gantt: Well, again, it's just it's one of the drivers on the top line, that is a change that we will deal with. And I think overall, it would be a positive for the economy and something that would be good to see. But I don't know anybody that would like showing up at the pump and seeing that bigger number. And certainly, that's been a big cost driver for what we've seen. I think it's better to for just cost inflation and other line items. I think the increased cost of fuel is driving inflation and about anything, whether it's a product or service that we're buying. And so, I think a decrease there certainly helps. But as we look back 2015-2016 were the timeframes that we last went through a bigger decrease in average fuel prices. And I think we continue to try to manage, just like we did in those periods, and continuing to manage the different components that go into building out our rates with customers, whether it's base rates, fuel surcharge, or as is oils managing all the revenue inputs with the cost inputs and trying to account for whether or not fuel goes up or down. So, it's just something that our pricing and costing teams and our sales teams have got to work through is we're working through renewals with our customers every day, and just looking at and seeing where we are and what we feel like we need to keep driving improvement in our customer specific pricing and profitability.\nScott Group: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good morning. I just want to ask about potential customer attrition, just given some of the freight challenges out there and certainly your customer focus on costs. Are you seeing any sort of attrition as customers try to tray down obviously, quality but prices low or the dynamics may be a little different this cycle, just any thoughts there?\nMarty Freeman: Yes, good morning. This is Marty, I'll take that one. We aren't seeing anything like we saw back in '08 or '09. We have customers in here every week, and our larger customers, contract customers coming in. Its business is usual. They're coming in and asking for contract renewals, additional services and so forth. So, we're not seeing anything out of the ordinary for the economic circumstances, no major price cutting or anything like that. So, I feel pretty confident that the end is probably near what we're going through.\nAllison Poliniak: Perfect, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Marty, since we have you, as you're entering, you're already there. But you're entering the head seat and the best mousetrap in the industry probably on the precipice of breaking the 70 OR basis. You've already laid out your CapEx for this year. But as you think strategically over the next few years, anything you're thinking about differently as it relates to growth, as it relates to the labor et cetera or is it just kind of ride the cycles of what you've had and continue to get incremental productivity out of that mousetrap?\nMarty Freeman: Well, one of the reasons we've been able to grow like we have over the last years is because we continue to build capacity even during slow times, and I don't see us moving away from that focus. So, we'll continue to do that. We'll continue to buy new equipment and hire employees as needed. So, I don't see any change from what we've been doing, this made us successful in the past.\nJon Chappell: Thanks, Marty.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning everyone. Congrats Greg and Marty and Marty, yes, please don't change the thing, just do -- in that seat and anything. A couple of follow-ups here, do you feel like you have a better ability to capture that spring inflection in growth if it comes versus peers given how much free capacity you have? And do you have a sense of your ability to grow into that volume relative to peers?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know about relative to peers, but certainly, we feel confident about our ability to grow. And I think you look at things in the past, we've certainly have been outgrowing the market relative over the last 10 years, in particular, year in and year out. When we're in up cycles, that's when our business shines the brightest. And certainly, our service is what wins us share and have an available capacity to respond to customers when they need us the most. That's kind of our hallmark. And so, we're sitting in a very good spot right now to be able to respond to that growth when the phone calls come, we're going to be picking them up.\nRavi Shanker: Got it, sounds good. And maybe as a follow-up kind of on the fuel topic, I mean, there's been a lot of speculation in the investment community about like fuel and kind of how much is driven earnings. And I think a lot of you -- I mean, you and your lot of your peers have been saying that, hey, there's a new algorithm when it comes to fuel pricing and it's stickier than you think, et cetera, et cetera. So, how do we think about how fuel becomes a headwind in the back-half of the year kind of there's any way to quantify that? And also kind of how much of that fuel can be sticky and kind of convert the base rate over time, do you think?\nAdam Satterfield: It's something that's -- we certainly faced this question before when fuel changes. I think that we got a pretty long period where we were at low fuel prices kind of going back to when that final decrease happened in 2016. And I'd say we had pretty good results between 2016 and 2020 when we were in a lower fuel environment. And again, I think that it's something that maybe people on the Street, it's hard to understand if you're not negotiating with some of these types of contracts. But for us, it's all about having a good cost model, understanding our cost and knowing what the revenue and the cost inputs are going to be whether fuels at $5 a gallon or $3 a gallon, it's just something that we've got to manage through. In some environment, some customers may want more or less and increase coming through, a base rate type of change, some may want more exposure to that variable component of pricing that would be the fuel surcharge. And there's ways to increase yields by driving productivity with customers as well, where we can obtain the same objective by just looking at the operational factors underneath, and having all of our systems tied into our cost model allows us to have those types of conversations with our customers as well. Ultimately, it's just about driving customer-specific profitability improvement and work in our continuous improvement cycle so that we can continue to purchase real estate and expand our network. So, customers have got that to leverage within their own supply chains. We're effectively buying capacity on behalf of our customers. So, I think we got to just continue to execute on that front. And I think that we've shown in terms of going through prior cycles that we'll be able to do so.\nRavi Shanker: Understood, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great, good morning, and again congrats, Greg, on your tenure, and Marty, on the new role. Just a quick clarification, I guess, on that spring pickup you've talked a bit about. Is that just comp based? Or is there a commentary you're hearing from customer comments or just I guess on showing up inventories? I just want to understand why the -- I guess, the confidence in that given the market and then my question is on depreciation. You know the depreciation is going to be higher. Last year, you targeted, I think it was $485 million on equipment at the beginning of this year -- at the beginning of the year. This year, you're doing $400 million on equipment. Is that because the delivery schedule was slower? Is -- what's your view on getting that equipment? And does that still allow you to stay at that 20%, 25% excess capacity that you typically target? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Yes, Ken, this is Greg. I think so on the -- I'll take your revenue question first, but we typically always pick up in the spring. So, certainly, we're hopeful that we get back into a more normal cycle than what we've certainly been in really since COVID. We've kind of been off cycle, if you will, if that makes sense. And the normal numbers and sequentials that we compare with all over the years, they're just been different in the last couple of years. So, certainly, getting back to a normal cycle would be one reason we are somewhat hopeful. Some of the things that we've seen, heard and read, inventories are starting to get low compared to where they were back, say, a year or six months ago. So, I think there are some things that lead us to believe that we could be coming out of this thing, plus we've been through many, many cycles over the years. And typically, they're a year, 16 months, so we kind of think that that's what we've been in this one. So, yes, we're hopeful, got our fingers crossed that we will come out of this thing as we get into the spring and later on in the second quarter. As far as the equipment, yes, it's been kind of funky. The deliveries that we -- cycle that we've been on this time. We certainly didn't get everything back last year like we typically would. Typically, we would have all of our orders in the early fall. We had everything in place that wasn't the case this year. We're actually still taking some equipment that we should have gotten back last year. So, it's been a little different. So, we'll just have to see how the business develops, and I think that's going to determine where that $400 million that we talked about number, where that goes this year. So, we'll just have to see, and it will certainly be based on our business conditions and the numbers that we see as we get on into 2023 as to how that $400 million develops this year compared to last year.\nKen Hoexter: Great, thanks, Greg. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, Operator. Hi, everyone, Greg, hearty congratulations on the retirement; and Marty, looking forward to working with you as well. I guess I wanted to ask about pricing. I know pricing discipline is good, so it's not really about that, but I guess we've seen a lot of LTL companies in recent months announced general rate increases. I guess what's surprising to me is some of the ones that have even a little bit weaker service that may be more tempted to lean into price have also announced big price increases. And I wanted to understand like the reaction from the customers because, in the typical cycle, a customer would maybe trade down to regional lanes with high-quality carriers. Maybe you lose 20%, 30% of your lanes or two or three lanes or whatever it is, that doesn't seem to be occurring right now where shippers are not moving to other high-quality, but regional lanes. And I want to understand, one, why you think that might be like what's the psychology of your customers in terms of how they think this cycle is going to play out? And then second, how does that impact your ability to bounce back? Because I would assume as there's a big seasonal pull in March and April, May. You don't have to win back lanes, you don't have to win back customers so you can kind of see it first in terms of that upswing. So, sorry for the long-winded question, but hopefully that was clear.\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know if I can explain the psychology of our customers, but I did take a psych class in college one, so I'll give it a shot, but I think that we've talked a lot about this that since going through COVID, there's been so much disruption to customer's supply chains and missed revenue opportunities, incremental cost added to production lines just because of all the supply chain challenges that many of our customers have been dealing with over the last couple of years. So, I think, for that reason, we've seen a little bit of change in customer behavior. I think customers have been sticking with us. And certainly, over the last year, as Marty mentioned earlier, despite the weakness that we've seen in the economy, we've seen good customer trends. We get periodic reporting from our national account sales teams. And we just -- we have not been losing customer accounts. I think customers have been keeping us in place because they inevitably know that one that many are still dealing with challenges. A lot of the conversations that we continue to have are more around challenges within the supply chain. And I think two is that they know that we are probably closer to things turning and orders picking back up for our customers' products. And they want to make sure that they have got capacity that's available as needed. There are a lot of competitors that had embargoes in places and communication to customers saying I am keeping you up today. But I can't pick you up tomorrow. And we were able to respond in particular in 2021 to a lot of those customers that called on us needing capacity. And so, I think that that's strengthened the relationships that we have with our customers. And we have got a lot of continuity within our customer base anyway. So, I think those -- everything that's happened over the last couple of years has really strengthened those customer relationships. So, I think that one of the things you said as part of your questions though gives us a little confidence in terms of when those orders for our customer product start picking up again in the sense that in prior cycles like 2016 or 2019 where we may have lost a few lanes or lost a customer account, we were always confident that the business would return to us in many case because the customer told us that they wanted to bring this back in when they could. But we had to wait until the next bid cycle before we got that opportunity. Customers are keeping us in place. They are keeping their contracts current, pricing terms updated. And so, I feel like that whenever those orders start picking up, we may be getting three shipments instead of two at every pick up. And volumes should return to us quicker than perhaps they have in prior down cycles.\nAmit Mehrotra: Right. Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And, congrats Greg, it's certainly been an impressive run that you have, and congrats also to Marty on some big shoes to fill here. So, I wanted to ask about you guys have talked about for some time the ability to get the OR into the 60s. I understand obviously there are different puts and takes on kind of economic uncertainty, maybe some cost inflammation, but also talking about this inflection that's expected for second quarter, it seems like there is some optimism there around the ability to perhaps improve OR year-over-year which would certainly suggest that you are kind of bumping up against that ability to get the OR to the 60s. I just want to get your updated thoughts kind of given the progression of OR improvement that we have seen over the last couple of years, do you think that OR in the 60s is achievable whether it's 2023 or into 2024?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, again I think we were saying earlier, certainly 2023 just given the environment it's certainly going to be a little bit more challenging. And we are continuing to keep our eye for the future. We are investing or planning to invest $800 million in capital expenditures this year when the economy is certainly soft right now. And we may end up being in a flattish type of revenue environment. So, revenue will certainly dictate a lot. But I think that just given the comparison to the two years that we have talked about, you can make your own assessments into what you think revenue may end up being for us this year. But if we are in a flattish revenue environment, then certainly we have seen the operating ratio increase slightly in those years. But the positioning that we are going through is to make sure that we are in a great position to be able to respond when that inflection does happen and we get back to a revenue growth environment. And we've averaged to 11% to 12% of revenue growth per year over the last 10 years. And we think of ourselves as a growth company. But, we are certainly going to be disciplined in periods where the economy is softer. And we have seen flattish type of revenue in those environments in the past when the economy has been slower. So, I think certainly a lot of depends on that. But, we had many type of OR degradation in the short run. I mean just for this year, the positioning in the recovery year is usually pretty doggone strong. And so, we continue to stand behind our goal of wanting to get to a sub-70% operating ratio. We didn't put a timeframe behind that when we laid it out last year, at this time, for this sole reason; we don't want to be beholden to something that's, in the short-run, that may jeopardize our opportunity for producing strong profitable growth in 2024, '25, and beyond. And I'm confident that we'll certainly be able to get to sub-70% for the year. We certainly did it for two quarters this year, in the second and third quarters. And so, I think we've shown that it can be done. And just to be clear, we continue to say that that is our next goal, but it will not be the final goal. We think that we can continue to go further from there, but we're going to keep that goal in sight for now. And once we achieve it, then we'll lay out where the next stop might be in this long-term OR journey.\nAri Rosa: Got it, understood. And then I wanted to ask also, as I think about the conditions that you've kind of been describing for 2022, where volumes have been a little bit softer than what you would have hoped for. Obviously, we've seen the headcount come down. And yet, your earnings growth was obviously strong this year, at 35%-plus. To what extent, when you're going out and talking to customers who maybe were a little bit squeezed on capacity during COVID conditions, as supply chains normalize, does that put a little bit of a headwind on your ability to go to customers and ask for rate increases? Or conversely, do they push back and say, \"Look, we gave you rate increases when capacity was really tight,\" but now the supply chain's kind of normalized a little bit, are they pushing back any more on some of the rate increases relative to what they were over the past 12 to 18 months?\nGreg Gantt: I think the answer to that is yes. They push harder when they know they -- either they are in a position to do so. And certainly with the conditions being soft like they've been, yes, they're pushing us for not as big of an increase, and that kind of thing. But you got to remember, we don't necessarily go into a customer and start talking about price. We talk about the value that we provide that customer, and that's what we will continue to sell them. We sell them value. And many times, value and price are pretty darn close, if you know what I mean, because if you're not getting value, what does the price matter? So, that's what we'll continue to sell. And thankfully, I think our customers have seen that, and in what OD has delivered over the years. And that's a huge reason for the success that we've had. So, we'll continue to focus on selling value, and not price. And honestly, try not to have those conversations.\nMarty Freeman: I wanted to thank our sales team who does a fantastic job of sharing our costing with our customers, especially our large customers. We're an open book; we actually show them what we're paying for equipment, how much it costs not to put -- freight, pick it up, sort and flag it, whatever the cost may be. And once you explain to them what our costs are, it's a lot easier to swallow a general rate increase. So, I think most of our customers understand what our costs are. And we try to explain that to the best of our ability.\nAri Rosa: Okay, makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the time and the thoughtful answers, and congrats again, Greg and Marty.\nMarty Freeman: Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. And I'll also echo congratulations, Greg, and congratulations, Marty. A lot of my questions have been answered at this point. Just a real quick one on fuel and the potential headwind that you were talking a little bit about, for '23, if I just look at this quarter, fuel surcharge revenue up $97 million incrementally, fuel expense up $48 million incrementally, so -- or $49 million. So, that the net of that was a positive $48 million. Total operating income was a positive $58 million. So, I guess part one is, is the math that simple, that of the $58 million operating improvement, $48 million was the fuel differential. And then I guess, if so, as I look at '23, given where fuel is right now, can you put or quantify what the magnitude of that headwind would be, say, the fuel surcharge component coming down, which you alluded to in the January data, versus fuel expense?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, the short answer is that the math is really not that simple. Going back to prior comments, fuel is just one of many elements that get negotiated as part of a customer's rate each year. So, it could be that we get more fuel surcharge in one particular more, more base rate in another. And so, trying to look out and measure what the surcharge revenue piece is versus what the potential expense might be is not really a one-for-one comparison in that regard. The surcharge, if a customer has decided to take on more variable exposure to that fluctuation in fuel is covering many more cost elements than just the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products. Certainly that's what it's designed to cover, but that's not everything that is covered by that variable component of pricing. So, again, I think the -- if you want to look back into a declining fuel environment, I would point people to look at 2015, and 2016. In '15, the average price of fuel was down 30% that year. Of course, we had volume growth, it was a little different macro environment, and so as a result we were able to improve the operating ratio that year. In '16, the average price of fuel decreased further. It decreased about 15% that year, and that was one of the years, as I mentioned earlier, that we had a 60 basis point increase in the operating ratio. That the overall macro was a little softer, volumes were certainly flattish that year. And so, a little bit different top line makeup, if you will. But so, that's probably a little bit more relative comparison, is looking back at how some of those revenue changes quarter-to-quarter, and cost changes progressed in that year. But we're certainly managing through it. And we're looking at -- we've got contracts that turn over every day, and they progress through the year. So, if fuel stays where it is today, then we're looking at a contract with a base rate of a fuel at $4.58 a gallon versus, last year, we were looking at it and it would have been $5-something per gallon. So, you just always got to look at what the current environment looks like, and then try to risk-adjust for do you think fuel prices may go up? If they do, again, how does the top line for each individual customer account change, and what do the cost inputs change? If fuel goes down, you do the same thing, and you try to make sure that those fuel scales, as they work on each customer account, that we're still effectively getting paid for the service that we're providing and, like Greg said, the value that we are offering. And so that's what we stay focused on. And it's less important for us to look at the profitability of each customer account.\nJeff Kauffman: All right, thank you for the clarification. But math for the fourth quarter would be fair at face value, but there's more uncertainty, to your point, looking to '23. Is that the right way to think about it?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, it -- certainly there is uncertainty with respect to what fuel may end up averaging. We had -- we have seen it declining a little bit more, and then it kind of reverted back and had a little bit of an increase over the last couple weeks as well. But certainly, if it holds steady from here, then maybe we see fuel prices that are down 10% or so this year. But I think it's better for the U.S. economy if we get back to a lower fuel environment. And certainly, we will deal with that from a company standpoint, it's not going to change our long-term objectives, and we're not changing our operating ratio, goals, just because fuel may ultimately decline. Those are certainly built into what our longer-term forecasts are. We think that it should decline overall, and hopefully we get back to a lower fuel environment.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: We thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we would be glad to take your questions. The Old Dominion team produced fourth quarter financial results that allowed us to finish the year with company records for annual revenue and profitability. We extended our track record of success and delivered the 10th straight quarter with both an increase in revenue and improvement in our operating ratio. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2022 was also the 10th straight quarter where we produced double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our team produced these results while facing many challenges during 2022, which were primarily related to the unexpected slowdown in the domestic economy. We entered the year anticipating growth in our volumes that didn't ultimately meet our initial expectations. But we made the necessary adjustments throughout the year that once again showed the flexibility and resiliency of our long-term strategic plan. We also maintained a watchful eye on the efficiency of our operations and continued with our disciplined approach to managing discretionary spending. Due to our confidence in our ability to win market share over the long-term, one thing that did not change in 2022 was our commitment to investing for the future. Capital expenditures, totaling $775.1 million in 2022, were a new company record. And we invested $299.5 million in real estate projects that further expanded the capacity of our service center network. We also continued to invest heavily in our OD Family of employees, with improvements in pay and benefits, as well as a company record contribution to our 401(k) retirement plan for employees. In dealing with the reality of slower than anticipated business volumes we also work diligently to protect the significant investments that we made over the past two years in our new employees. Thinking of new employees, I am proud to share that there have been over 1,300 new drivers that graduated from our internal truck driving school over the past two years. And in some cases, these driver school graduates that now have their CDLs are temporarily working on non-driving roles. While this comes at an increased cost to the company, we believe this bigger pool of licensed drivers will provide us with the strategic advantage once the freight cycle turns and additional volume opportunities become available to us. We said in our third quarter earnings call that we anticipated volumes could start increasing in the spring of this year. And we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that this will occur despite ongoing risk with the domestic economy. Regardless of the economic environment, I believe our 2022 results provide yet another example of why our long-term strategic plan will remain our focus for the foreseeable future. Consistent execution of this plan had helped us create an unmatched value proposition in our industry that led to over $1 billion of revenue growth for the second straight year, in 2022. I am confident that this commitment to our strategic plan will also continue after my retirement at the end of June, this year. Our long-term success is the result of a strong team and their combined commitment to maintaining a strong company culture. After working with Marty for most of my career, I can tell you that he lives and breathes the OD Family spirit, and will help take the company to new heights. I think the best is yet to come for Old Dominion. And I look forward to watching OD expand its long-term record of success. Thank you for joining us this morning. And now, here is Marty Freeman to provide some more details on the fourth quarter. Thanks, Jack. Appreciate the kind words. And it's been a good run. Thanks, Basc. And this is Greg. But I will take that and try to give you as much color only as possible. But obviously we made some adjustments where we felt like we needed to in headcount. And as Adam mentioned earlier, we talked about attrition. And we have kind of let attrition control some of these adjustments. But we have made some in other places where we needed to. Certainly, we haven't replaced openings likely typically would in a normal cycle where we are growing and what not. But -- and that will continue to be our efforts still thanks to our return of the other ways. So, we will see typically -- we will see a little uptick late February. Going into March, things really start to pickup. So, is that going to be the trend this year? We hope so, but just not absolutely certain. But I think we are in a good spot because as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we've got an awful lot of qualified drivers that we have got work on the platform and what not. They are not driving full time. So, I think we will certainly be ready when the increase does happen, you know, hope it's sooner than later, but definitely we will continue to make adjustments as needed. We talked about this on some of our prior calls. We have been able to make these adjustments in downturns in the past. I think we pretty began we can make adjustments when we need to. We have done it again. We feel good about where we are. We just have to continue to stay on top of it and react as the business dictates. I hope that helps. Not that I know of, Basc, and don't think so. I think it should be fairly normal from that standpoint. We certainly had some good experiences in the recent past with our benefit cost and those kinds of things. So, you just hope that those things continue to be consistent and don't turn the other way for some or no reason. Sure thing. Good morning, Tom. I would say during the fourth quarter we saw a pretty consistent revenue performance with both our industrial customer base and our retail customer base. I would say earlier part of the year we had seen a little bit stronger performance on the industrial side. And those two kind of converged, if you will, in the fourth quarter. Obviously, our customer bases leans more industrial than retail. We are still 55% to 60% industrial overall and 25% to 30% or so on the retail side. In longer term that retail business has been growing faster than the industrial. And I think that reflects some of the ecommerce trends and the effects of those on our customer supply chains. And we certainly continue to believe that that will be a longer term tailwind for us. And I think that as we start working through 2023. And we believe that we will start seeing customer's orders for their products picking up and some inventory rebalancing if you will. And I think that's why we've seen in some of the prior slow period that I spoke of earlier why you start seeing that orders and freight flows kind of leading the other macroeconomic indicator. So, we believe that the freight cycle will starting turning. And we will start seeing some pick up. And it's through these customer interactions and conversations that, that support our belief that we're going to start seeing freight flow, and again, as we get into March and into the second quarter. And maybe we start seeing retail outperform again, while I assume, and some of the industrial numbers look a little bit weaker, we start getting some of that retail performance as an offset, leading us out and eventually we'll start seeing the industrial picking back up again. Thanks, Tom. Yes, I think that, Chris, that some of the conversation earlier about headcount, probably on paper, we may be a little bit heavy now, if you just look at things statistically, if you will. But that's kind of the point of the, what we've said is, I think that we're in a good spot, with our headcount with our fleet, and certainly with the service center network to be able to let volume start flowing again. And when we talk about increases, just keep in mind that we're talking about sequential increases, and certainly with the year-over-year comps, particularly in the first-half of the year, we've got some tougher year-over-year comparisons there before we get back to, does being able to show year-over-year growth. But I think that'll be the important thing for us to continue to watch is, are we seeing those types of sequential increases? And certainly we've got a lot of flexibility within our workforce. And I think that, given the team that we have, and the current levels, we should be able to respond to growth when it starts coming at us and get some good leverage, as it does. But certainly we're looking at right now in the first quarter. Like I mentioned, with the January tonnage levels, we've got probably the volumes that are going to be the toughest comp, and certainly, overall, the fourth quarter we were down 9.1%. Our yield performance is still looking good. And we certainly expect to continue to push for core yield increases this year to offset our cost inflation, as well. But there could become some converging factors, if you will, that drive the top line, depending on what the overall fuel environment looks like, and so forth. But we're certainly going to continue to look and execute on the same pricing philosophy that we have in the past and look for cost plus increases to offset the cost inflation that we see in the business and to keep supporting these expensive investments that we're making in our real estate network and technologies that can both improve customer service, but also drive further operating efficiencies for us. So, a lot of things to kind of manage through it particularly the first-half of this year, but I think we're in a good spot to be able to handle the volumes if they do backflow our way. Well, I think that again, the revenue environment will have a lot to say about that, more broadly speaking, we've talked and kind of pointed everyone to our performance in 2016 and 2019, when we've been in a flatter revenue environment, certainly, given the planned investment of about $800 million in capital expenditures this year. And with some pressures that we'll see on depreciation, starting earlier in the year than normal, we will have some pressures, if you will, on those overhead costs. And we saw a little bit of that in the fourth quarter already where overhead costs as a percent of revenue were flat in 4Q '22 versus 4Q '21. But like we did in '16 and in '19, the focus when we're in a flat to a down revenue environment will be managing our variable costs flat, and we'd love to see improvement, but trying to hold all those costs flat. And then, any deterioration if there is anything would be in those overhead costs in particular, on the depreciation side. And so, I think that in '16, we certainly saw a little bit of a decrease in the operating ratio or an increase, rather depending on how you look at it. But I think our operating ratio deteriorated 60 basis points that year. And that was something that was right in line with the change in the depreciation line item. And then, '19 was the same thing, where we had 30 basis points deterioration there. So, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter, certainly, and we'll talk as we get to the end of next quarter's call about what we think we may be able to do in 2Q, but certainly feel like we're probably going to have a little bit more pressure on the overhead side this year if we are in fact a flat to slightly down revenue environment, but there's still a lot up in the air when it comes to the top line for this year. Well, again, it's just it's one of the drivers on the top line, that is a change that we will deal with. And I think overall, it would be a positive for the economy and something that would be good to see. But I don't know anybody that would like showing up at the pump and seeing that bigger number. And certainly, that's been a big cost driver for what we've seen. I think it's better to for just cost inflation and other line items. I think the increased cost of fuel is driving inflation and about anything, whether it's a product or service that we're buying. And so, I think a decrease there certainly helps. But as we look back 2015-2016 were the timeframes that we last went through a bigger decrease in average fuel prices. And I think we continue to try to manage, just like we did in those periods, and continuing to manage the different components that go into building out our rates with customers, whether it's base rates, fuel surcharge, or as is oils managing all the revenue inputs with the cost inputs and trying to account for whether or not fuel goes up or down. So, it's just something that our pricing and costing teams and our sales teams have got to work through is we're working through renewals with our customers every day, and just looking at and seeing where we are and what we feel like we need to keep driving improvement in our customer specific pricing and profitability. Thanks, Scott. Yes, Ken, this is Greg. I think so on the -- I'll take your revenue question first, but we typically always pick up in the spring. So, certainly, we're hopeful that we get back into a more normal cycle than what we've certainly been in really since COVID. We've kind of been off cycle, if you will, if that makes sense. And the normal numbers and sequentials that we compare with all over the years, they're just been different in the last couple of years. So, certainly, getting back to a normal cycle would be one reason we are somewhat hopeful. Some of the things that we've seen, heard and read, inventories are starting to get low compared to where they were back, say, a year or six months ago. So, I think there are some things that lead us to believe that we could be coming out of this thing, plus we've been through many, many cycles over the years. And typically, they're a year, 16 months, so we kind of think that that's what we've been in this one. So, yes, we're hopeful, got our fingers crossed that we will come out of this thing as we get into the spring and later on in the second quarter. As far as the equipment, yes, it's been kind of funky. The deliveries that we -- cycle that we've been on this time. We certainly didn't get everything back last year like we typically would. Typically, we would have all of our orders in the early fall. We had everything in place that wasn't the case this year. We're actually still taking some equipment that we should have gotten back last year. So, it's been a little different. So, we'll just have to see how the business develops, and I think that's going to determine where that $400 million that we talked about number, where that goes this year. So, we'll just have to see, and it will certainly be based on our business conditions and the numbers that we see as we get on into 2023 as to how that $400 million develops this year compared to last year. I think the answer to that is yes. They push harder when they know they -- either they are in a position to do so. And certainly with the conditions being soft like they've been, yes, they're pushing us for not as big of an increase, and that kind of thing. But you got to remember, we don't necessarily go into a customer and start talking about price. We talk about the value that we provide that customer, and that's what we will continue to sell them. We sell them value. And many times, value and price are pretty darn close, if you know what I mean, because if you're not getting value, what does the price matter? So, that's what we'll continue to sell. And thankfully, I think our customers have seen that, and in what OD has delivered over the years. And that's a huge reason for the success that we've had. So, we'll continue to focus on selling value, and not price. And honestly, try not to have those conversations. Thanks. We thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. And please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth, of 5.8% in the fourth quarter, resulted from a 16.7% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 9.1% decrease in LTL tons. LTL revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharges increased 8.7% and reflects the continued execution of our long-term pricing initiatives. Our consistent approach to pricing is supported by our ability to provide our customers with superior service and available capacity. We believe this value offering is becoming increasingly important to shipper, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the fourth quarter decreased 2.4% when compared to the third quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 4.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.3% in tons per day, and a decrease of 3.3% in shipments per day. For January, our revenue per day increased approximately 4.2% as compared to January of 2022. This growth included a 13.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 7.8% decrease in the LTL tons per day. Our fourth quarter operating ratio improved to 71.2%, which is primarily due to an improvement in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating cost, productive labor as a percent of revenue improved 170 basis points, which our purchase transportation costs improved 200 basis points. These changes more than offset the 260 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that primarily resulted from a significant increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products during the quarter. Our overhead costs as a percent of revenue were consistent between the periods compared. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $361.3 million and $1.7 billion for the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $270.4 million and $775.1 million for the same periods. As Marty mentioned, we currently expect capital expenditures of $800 million in 2023. We utilized $199.9 million and $1.3 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.0 million and $134.5 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 33.3% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.40 per share for the first quarter of 2023. Our effective tax rate for both fourth quarter 2022 and 2021 was 25.0%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.8% for 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Sure. The overall dollars, obviously, we've been making adjustments as we've gone through the year. And I would say through the back-half of the year, in particular, we've been letting attrition take place, and just consistently adjusting our headcount and the hours worked by our people in relation to what the volume environment dictates to continue to give service by continuing to operate efficiently. And so, I think, overall, that helped drive the decrease in that quarter-over-quarter, those expenses, if you will. So, we continue to be focused, obviously, on managing those costs. That's our biggest cost element of our business is in the salaries, wages, and benefits. And so, it's certainly the biggest area of focus as we try to continue to run our network as efficiently as possible without giving any sacrifice to service. So, I do think that given the environment in the fourth quarter, I think we had, given the circumstance, is pretty strong revenue performance. So, I was pleased with the way our revenue and volumes trended. And that was probably one of the favorable line items, if you will, in comparison to the guidance that we had originally provided with respect to the operation ratio, was how the salary, wages, and benefits ended up coming in for us. Well, I think we're in a good spot right now with where our headcount is. And typically, we start seeing increases in volume. And certainly, we're not in a normal environment by any stretch. But our January volumes were slightly positive versus December, pretty flattish overall, really when you look at it from a shipment perspective. But we continue to anticipate that we will see volumes return to us in the spring. And I think we want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to deal with that environment whenever it inevitably comes. We're certainly very confident about what our future market share opportunities will be. And so, we want to make sure that we're in a position with our people, our equipment, and certainly our service and our network to be able to effectively respond when that does happen. Typically, the February volumes are a little bit higher than January. And it's March when we start seeing the increase coming. And so, I think that what we're trying to do is just, again, measure and manage all elements of capacity to ensure that we're in a good spot when that happens. So, again, I think that certainly a lot in the first quarter and probably the first-half of the year really depends on what the volume environment gives us. But we continue to believe that we are going to see some increase. We've certainly seen it in the past, even in down economic environments, whether you look at something as bad as the environment was in 2009. I think 2016 is another good example, where our second quarter volumes were higher than the first. And so, it'll be a little different situation, I think, playing out this year in comparison to 2022, when, beginning with April, our volumes were either decreasing or flattish on a month-over-month basis as we worked our way through the year. Certainly, we'd like to see volumes flowing into us as we transition and make our way through 2023. And hopefully start getting a little help from the macroeconomic environment as well. Yes, I guess from a volume standpoint on a year-over-year basis, January, our tons per day were down 7.8% that compares to December where we were down 12.3% overall. I would point out and obviously we will continue to give our mid quarter updates. We have a little bit easier comparison with the January year-over-year comp, and we had very strong performance in February of last year. So, that kind of gets a little bit more difficult there. And then, they obviously start getting easier. So, I guess be aware of that when we give that February update in a month or so. But nevertheless, I was pretty pleased with the way really going back through the fourth quarter. December came in a little bit stronger than what our normal sequential change is. And that's the month we kind of talked about I think on the last call in the fourth quarter in particular in some slower economic environment is where we have seen pretty hefty drop-off in our business levels. And the fact that we stayed pretty steady rather I think was a positive takeaway for me. I was hoping that we would see our sequential performance from a volume standpoint to be a little closer to our 10-year average trends. And certainly, it was. The fourth quarter volumes were down 4.4% sequentially, the normal changes of 1.3% decrease. But if we compare back to where we were in the second and third quarters relative to our 10-year average changes, I think, we are starting to trend back in the right direction, and whether or not we get back to the full 10-year average at least in the first-half of the year remains to be seen. I think we probably need a little bit stronger economy. But I do think that we are going to start seeing some increases like we mentioned particularly starting in March and then continuing through the second quarter. And then, we will see where things go from there. But I think that certainly that volume environment really will dictate what the operating ratio does typically just to give a little bit more color on the first quarter operating ratio. We typically have about a 100 basis point increase there coming off the fourth quarter. In this particular first quarter of 2023, we did have a favorable insurance adjustment. We have talked on -- and given the guidance for 4Q assuming that line held steady. There was improvement there. And I think that that will normalize back to around 1.2% of revenue in 1Q of 23. So, that's becomes a 70 basis point or so headwind for us. I think that we are going to continue to see a little bit of a headwind from depreciation as well. We have talked about this as we worked our way through last year that our delivery cycle was a little bit different than prior year. And so, we are probably going to see a little bit more headwind from here. So, on a normalized basis that probably puts us at about 200 basis point increase. So, we are where we just finished the fourth quarter. But -- so, that kind of puts us somewhat flattish if you will on a year-over-year basis if we were to hit that. And certainly, I think if we get better revenue performance, we have got the opportunity to be able to outperform that longer term normalized average. But I think the revenue environment will certainly control a lot of it for us. Thanks, Jack. Yes, net of fuel in January was about 8.5%. So, fairly consistent with what we just did in the fourth quarter overall. And we are starting to see a decrease in fuel. And we'll see how that continues to trend this year. And so, perhaps the yield with and without the fuel, those two numbers will maybe be a little bit more consistent. I think that fuel hold steady with where we are right now, it certainly becomes a headwind as we get into the later quarters of the year, but nonetheless, I think that certainly there's always mix changes that can drive that number, higher or lower. But I think it's pretty consistent with what our long-term philosophy has been. We certainly dealt with higher cost inflation on a per shipment basis in 2022 than then what at least I initially expected I thought we would see some cost moderation as we got into the back-half of the year, which obviously did not happen. So, we just continue to execute on that same consistent philosophy that we always have. And I think that's why we saw that the yield performance that we did, but I believe that call should be a little bit more favorable versus the last couple of years. And 2023 are certainly that's our hope. And we'll continue to build our cost model around what that cost inflation expectation is and then continue to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread above that inflation to again support the investments that we're going to make. So, I think overall, if you did sort of roll out typically the first quarter our yield metrics are up about 0.5% over the fourth quarter. We'd expect to continue to see if mix is constant. Those numbers increase sequentially quarter-after-quarter, but certainly that some of that, that growth if you will may start to moderate a bit but again you're going to see that same type of moderation or should, what the costs. But nonetheless, the overall philosophy stays the same, and we'll continue to look for cost plus pricing. I don't know about relative to peers, but certainly, we feel confident about our ability to grow. And I think you look at things in the past, we've certainly have been outgrowing the market relative over the last 10 years, in particular, year in and year out. When we're in up cycles, that's when our business shines the brightest. And certainly, our service is what wins us share and have an available capacity to respond to customers when they need us the most. That's kind of our hallmark. And so, we're sitting in a very good spot right now to be able to respond to that growth when the phone calls come, we're going to be picking them up. It's something that's -- we certainly faced this question before when fuel changes. I think that we got a pretty long period where we were at low fuel prices kind of going back to when that final decrease happened in 2016. And I'd say we had pretty good results between 2016 and 2020 when we were in a lower fuel environment. And again, I think that it's something that maybe people on the Street, it's hard to understand if you're not negotiating with some of these types of contracts. But for us, it's all about having a good cost model, understanding our cost and knowing what the revenue and the cost inputs are going to be whether fuels at $5 a gallon or $3 a gallon, it's just something that we've got to manage through. In some environment, some customers may want more or less and increase coming through, a base rate type of change, some may want more exposure to that variable component of pricing that would be the fuel surcharge. And there's ways to increase yields by driving productivity with customers as well, where we can obtain the same objective by just looking at the operational factors underneath, and having all of our systems tied into our cost model allows us to have those types of conversations with our customers as well. Ultimately, it's just about driving customer-specific profitability improvement and work in our continuous improvement cycle so that we can continue to purchase real estate and expand our network. So, customers have got that to leverage within their own supply chains. We're effectively buying capacity on behalf of our customers. So, I think we got to just continue to execute on that front. And I think that we've shown in terms of going through prior cycles that we'll be able to do so. I don't know if I can explain the psychology of our customers, but I did take a psych class in college one, so I'll give it a shot, but I think that we've talked a lot about this that since going through COVID, there's been so much disruption to customer's supply chains and missed revenue opportunities, incremental cost added to production lines just because of all the supply chain challenges that many of our customers have been dealing with over the last couple of years. So, I think, for that reason, we've seen a little bit of change in customer behavior. I think customers have been sticking with us. And certainly, over the last year, as Marty mentioned earlier, despite the weakness that we've seen in the economy, we've seen good customer trends. We get periodic reporting from our national account sales teams. And we just -- we have not been losing customer accounts. I think customers have been keeping us in place because they inevitably know that one that many are still dealing with challenges. A lot of the conversations that we continue to have are more around challenges within the supply chain. And I think two is that they know that we are probably closer to things turning and orders picking back up for our customers' products. And they want to make sure that they have got capacity that's available as needed. There are a lot of competitors that had embargoes in places and communication to customers saying I am keeping you up today. But I can't pick you up tomorrow. And we were able to respond in particular in 2021 to a lot of those customers that called on us needing capacity. And so, I think that that's strengthened the relationships that we have with our customers. And we have got a lot of continuity within our customer base anyway. So, I think those -- everything that's happened over the last couple of years has really strengthened those customer relationships. So, I think that one of the things you said as part of your questions though gives us a little confidence in terms of when those orders for our customer product start picking up again in the sense that in prior cycles like 2016 or 2019 where we may have lost a few lanes or lost a customer account, we were always confident that the business would return to us in many case because the customer told us that they wanted to bring this back in when they could. But we had to wait until the next bid cycle before we got that opportunity. Customers are keeping us in place. They are keeping their contracts current, pricing terms updated. And so, I feel like that whenever those orders start picking up, we may be getting three shipments instead of two at every pick up. And volumes should return to us quicker than perhaps they have in prior down cycles. Well, again I think we were saying earlier, certainly 2023 just given the environment it's certainly going to be a little bit more challenging. And we are continuing to keep our eye for the future. We are investing or planning to invest $800 million in capital expenditures this year when the economy is certainly soft right now. And we may end up being in a flattish type of revenue environment. So, revenue will certainly dictate a lot. But I think that just given the comparison to the two years that we have talked about, you can make your own assessments into what you think revenue may end up being for us this year. But if we are in a flattish revenue environment, then certainly we have seen the operating ratio increase slightly in those years. But the positioning that we are going through is to make sure that we are in a great position to be able to respond when that inflection does happen and we get back to a revenue growth environment. And we've averaged to 11% to 12% of revenue growth per year over the last 10 years. And we think of ourselves as a growth company. But, we are certainly going to be disciplined in periods where the economy is softer. And we have seen flattish type of revenue in those environments in the past when the economy has been slower. So, I think certainly a lot of depends on that. But, we had many type of OR degradation in the short run. I mean just for this year, the positioning in the recovery year is usually pretty doggone strong. And so, we continue to stand behind our goal of wanting to get to a sub-70% operating ratio. We didn't put a timeframe behind that when we laid it out last year, at this time, for this sole reason; we don't want to be beholden to something that's, in the short-run, that may jeopardize our opportunity for producing strong profitable growth in 2024, '25, and beyond. And I'm confident that we'll certainly be able to get to sub-70% for the year. We certainly did it for two quarters this year, in the second and third quarters. And so, I think we've shown that it can be done. And just to be clear, we continue to say that that is our next goal, but it will not be the final goal. We think that we can continue to go further from there, but we're going to keep that goal in sight for now. And once we achieve it, then we'll lay out where the next stop might be in this long-term OR journey. Yes, the short answer is that the math is really not that simple. Going back to prior comments, fuel is just one of many elements that get negotiated as part of a customer's rate each year. So, it could be that we get more fuel surcharge in one particular more, more base rate in another. And so, trying to look out and measure what the surcharge revenue piece is versus what the potential expense might be is not really a one-for-one comparison in that regard. The surcharge, if a customer has decided to take on more variable exposure to that fluctuation in fuel is covering many more cost elements than just the cost of fuel and other petroleum-based products. Certainly that's what it's designed to cover, but that's not everything that is covered by that variable component of pricing. So, again, I think the -- if you want to look back into a declining fuel environment, I would point people to look at 2015, and 2016. In '15, the average price of fuel was down 30% that year. Of course, we had volume growth, it was a little different macro environment, and so as a result we were able to improve the operating ratio that year. In '16, the average price of fuel decreased further. It decreased about 15% that year, and that was one of the years, as I mentioned earlier, that we had a 60 basis point increase in the operating ratio. That the overall macro was a little softer, volumes were certainly flattish that year. And so, a little bit different top line makeup, if you will. But so, that's probably a little bit more relative comparison, is looking back at how some of those revenue changes quarter-to-quarter, and cost changes progressed in that year. But we're certainly managing through it. And we're looking at -- we've got contracts that turn over every day, and they progress through the year. So, if fuel stays where it is today, then we're looking at a contract with a base rate of a fuel at $4.58 a gallon versus, last year, we were looking at it and it would have been $5-something per gallon. So, you just always got to look at what the current environment looks like, and then try to risk-adjust for do you think fuel prices may go up? If they do, again, how does the top line for each individual customer account change, and what do the cost inputs change? If fuel goes down, you do the same thing, and you try to make sure that those fuel scales, as they work on each customer account, that we're still effectively getting paid for the service that we're providing and, like Greg said, the value that we are offering. And so that's what we stay focused on. And it's less important for us to look at the profitability of each customer account. Well, it -- certainly there is uncertainty with respect to what fuel may end up averaging. We had -- we have seen it declining a little bit more, and then it kind of reverted back and had a little bit of an increase over the last couple weeks as well. But certainly, if it holds steady from here, then maybe we see fuel prices that are down 10% or so this year. But I think it's better for the U.S. economy if we get back to a lower fuel environment. And certainly, we will deal with that from a company standpoint, it's not going to change our long-term objectives, and we're not changing our operating ratio, goals, just because fuel may ultimately decline. Those are certainly built into what our longer-term forecasts are. We think that it should decline overall, and hopefully we get back to a lower fuel environment."

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but we ask in fairness to all that you limit yourselves to just a couple of questions at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, the Old Dominion team extended the company's track record for double-digit growth in revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2022 was our seventh straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth and the nice straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. These financial results reflect the ongoing strength and demand for our services as we continue to deliver value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. Consistently executing on this key element of our long-term strategic plan is critical to our continued ability to win long-term market share. We were pleased to provide our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.2% during the third quarter. Service means much more than just picking up and delivering our customers' freight on time and damage free. In fact, MASTIO & Company conducts a comprehensive industry study each year that most recently measured carriers on 28 service and value-related attributes. We are extremely proud that MASTIO recently named OD as the #1 LTL provider for the 13th straight year. And this latest survey, shippers and logistics professionals ranked OD as #1 for 24 of the 28 individual attributes. The consistency of our service performance over many years, as validated by MASTIO reflects the commitment from each of our team members who work hard every day to go above and beyond for our customers. Our superior service performance has not only allowed us to win market share over the long term. It has also supported our long-term yield management strategy. This simple strategy focuses on increasing our yields to offset our cost inflation each year while also supporting our ongoing investments in capacity. We have consistently invested 10% to 15% of our revenue in capital expenditures each year regardless of the economic environment. Investments in our fleet and technologies have helped us improve our operating efficiency and customer service, while the significant investments in our service center network generally support our growth. We have expanded the capacity of our service center network by over 50% in the past 10 years while doubling our market share, and we believe further investments will be necessary to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We believe a big part of our value proposition is having available capacities when our customers need it the most. The capacity advantage we have in the marketplace was especially critical for customers that dealt with various supply chain issues over the past 2 years, while industry capacity was generally limited. We increased our revenues by over $2 billion over the past 2 years, which would not have been possible if we had not consistently increased our network capacity. Our business model continues to prove itself time and again, and we are extremely grateful to our customers for their trust in us. Freight is a relationship business, and we believe our superior service, available network capacity and consistent approach to pricing have allowed us to strengthen our long-term relationships. We also believe the value offered by a carrier is becoming increasingly important to shippers, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. As a result, we will continue to focus on providing customers with superior service at a fair price. We will also continue to invest in our OD Family of employees, our fleet and our service center network to support our long-term growth initiatives. Old Dominion has the financial strength to make these investments, and as a result, we believe we are better positioned than any carrier to produce long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 14.5% in the third quarter to $1.6 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 69.1%. The combination of these changes helped produce a 36% increase in earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Our revenue growth was due primarily to the 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 2.6% decrease in our LTL tons. We believe this decrease in LTL tons reflects the overall softness in the domestic economy that has generally caused a decrease in demand for our customers' products. Demand for our service has remained strong, however, as customers are continuing to take advantage of our value proposition. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 3.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 1.2% in tons per day and an increase of 2.4% in shipments per day. At this point, in October, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 8% when compared to October 2021. This month-to-date revenue performance includes a decrease of approximately 7% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio improved to 69.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 300 basis points due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products as well as the increased cost for parts and repairs to maintain our fleet. We more than offset the impact of this increase with the improvement in our salaries, wages and benefits and purchase transportation. The improvement in these expenses as a percent of revenue reflects our best efforts to effectively match all of our variable costs with current revenue and volume trends. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $514.2 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $181.7 million and $504.8 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $720 million for this year. The decrease from our prior estimate is primarily due to the timing of equipment deliveries that we expect to be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about our 2023 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release. We utilized $345.4 million and $1.1 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.4 million and $101.4 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2022 was 23.9% as compared to 25.2% in the third quarter 2021. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. So I guess, first, Adam, I'd be curious if you could maybe give us the full stats for September in terms of tonnage per day on a year-over-year basis. And was there anything sort of unique kind of going on in September with regard to the end of the quarter with the hurricane? And I guess just kind of wrapping up that September, October commentary, I guess, do you feel like that the sequential trends are the underperformance versus seasonality is maybe accelerating somewhat. And if you can maybe provide some color on sort of what's driving that. So anyway, I know a lot there, but just sort of curious on current trends and if you could provide some additional color there.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. We'll test my memory, I guess, and see if I can remember all of those. But so for September, looking at on a year-over-year basis, our tonnage was down 5.4% and then shipments, those were, let's see here, shipments per day were down 6.8%. So we had a little bit of an increase in weight per shipment for the month. It was up about 1.5% overall. And so if you remember, we've talked before about the weight per shipment trend last year, the third quarter was our low watermark, if you will, where we were at a total of 1,538 pounds. So we did start seeing a sequential increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. So that should somewhat normalize as we transition. Looking at things on a sequential basis for the tonnage, we did have in September about a 0.4% increase versus August. The 10-year average is a 3.9% increase. So similar, I think what we saw in the third quarter is similar to the second quarter. We did underperform for the total quarter, the average sequential trends in 2Q. And we did, again, this is the third straight quarter of underperformance, if you will, but we started out with the decrease in July, which is pretty typical. We were down 4%. The 10-year average is down 3%. And then we dropped a little bit further in August, which is normally about flattish. And then we just didn't see the sizable increase that we typically do in September. I will say that so far and obviously, there are still days to be finished for October, but we look like we are trending pretty much right in line with normal seasonality at this point, which I think is an encouraging trend. Certainly, a lot of work left to do as we go through the fourth quarter. Typically, we would see an increase in November and then it drops off in December. Normally, overall, you've got a decrease on average for the fourth quarter versus the third. Last year, we did have an increase, which makes the comps quite a bit tougher in the fourth quarter. And we anticipated that really is going into the beginning of this year, really. So I think it's just one of those things, like we said in our prepared remarks that certainly feels like demand for us. The feedback that we're getting from our customers has been positive. We're seeing good trends with our national account reporting. We're not losing customers. So things are all trending favorably in that regard. It's just a matter of the demand, we feel like is not out there for our customers' products, if you will. We're just not picking up as much freight for those same customers that we may be making stops every day at their locations. So just continuing to kind of work through these challenges, if you will. We certainly made adjustments all year. I think when you look at the operating ratio performance in general and what our service metrics are, we've been making adjustments to this lower-than-anticipated volume environment that we've been in. But we typically, when we've been in a down cycle, we've been in a negative GDP environment this year. A lot of times, we'll see 3 to 5 quarters where we kind of underperform our 10-year average. I always like to remind everyone that our 10-year average includes doubling their market share. But this, like I said, was the third quarter where we underperformed. We're going into the winter. That's always a little bit seasonally slower anyways. And so we feel like based on what we've been able to do so far this year producing over $900 million of revenue growth, good solid operating ratio improvement. We'll get through this winter and then perhaps we start seeing some build up once we get into the spring and I'm talking on a sequential basis, start seeing that build up back in the business once we get into the spring. Maybe sooner, obviously, a lot's going on with the economy. But that's some of the baseline for what we're thinking right now.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's very helpful color, Adam. And you got all my all those different questions in there. I guess maybe for my one quick follow-up. Would just be curious to kind of get your sense for sequential, how we should be thinking about the sequential change in operating ratio 3Q to 4Q? I know to your point, typically, tonnage is a bit softer sequentially. And there's -- I'm sure a lot of puts and takes out there. Historically, it's about 200 basis point degradation 3Q to 4Q. Is that the right way to think about it this year? Or just some additional color would be helpful.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes, for one, the fourth quarter, we usually have an annual actuarial assessment that can impact, if you just look at the raw numbers, the pure average. But it's usually about a 200 to 250 basis point sequential deterioration from 3Q to 4Q. And I think probably the appropriate target would be about a 400 basis points increase off of 69.1 that we had. And just talking through a few of those puts and takes that will go into it. And I'd say 400, probably plus or minus a little bit, just depending on -- in some cases, some of these expense items I'm about to talk about, but also the top line. But obviously, we've got -- we had a onetime item that favorably impacted our operating ratio by about 100 basis points in the third quarter. So kind of adding that back to normalized what our fringe benefit cost have been trending earlier this year. Then I think that similar to the 2Q to 3Q change in our general supplies and expenses, we generally see a little bit of improvement from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I expect that from a dollar standpoint, that should remain somewhat flattish, but as revenue is typically a little bit lower, we'd expect that to increase. Maybe 20 basis points from 3Q to 4Q. Depreciation is another item. We're still taking delivery of equipment. Normally, you kind of have all your depreciation in there, so I'd expect to see that continue, tick up a little bit. And then finally, our miscellaneous expenses, those have trended low throughout the year. Those are typically around about 0.5 point. I think we're at 20 basis points, 0.2% in the third quarter. So I expect that to normalize at some point as well. So some of those cost items just may create just a little bit of variance versus what the 10-year average might otherwise suggest. But you know us, I mean, we're looking at every dollar we can from a discretionary spending standpoint and we'll be managing productivity and other costs as tightly as we can as we continue to adjust to current top line revenue and volume trends.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nJames Monigan: James on for Allison. Actually, I just wanted to get a little bit more color on September and just kind of wanted to understand if there was a mix shift in the in that month that might have impacted yields and trying to sort of get a sense of what pricing was independent of sort of that mix shift change and sort of how we should think about that moving forward?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, nothing major that we have not already been seeing certainly that our weight per shipment has been trending higher, as I mentioned, at least through the third quarter. And then our length of haul has been a bit lower as well. That's down almost 1%. So both of those metrics putting a little downward pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight metric. And which I think we've talked a little bit about that on the last earnings call. Overall, excluding the fuel surcharge, the revenue per hundredweight was up 7%. So we're still seeing good yield performance overall. And then those yields are mix metrics, if you will, somewhat reconcile how we got from the growth rate that we are seeing for the second quarter to the third quarter. But overall, as contracts are renewing, we're continuing to look for increases and design with our long-term philosophy is we always are looking to try to increase yields to offset our cost inflation. I would say, core inflation is probably a bit higher than what some of these increases we're getting right now just dealing with this inflationary environment. But we're always looking at things on a long-term basis. And so we're continuing to make progress on those renewals, try to get our cost-plus type pricing to ultimately support the investments that we're making back in the system. We've invested a lot in real estate capital expenditures. When you look over the last 10 years, it's been almost $4 billion of investment in total with about $2 billion going into our real estate network. So I think we've certainly done a good job of making sure we're investing ahead of growth, and we don't want the network to be a limiting factor to our ability to grow. And so it's been important to build in that capacity into the service center network, and it certainly makes years like 2021 and the growth that we've seen in revenue this year possible.\nJames Monigan: Got it. And just a follow-up on that, just given the renewals that you're seeing, the sort of efficiency in the network, like if tonnage trends continue negatively or even sort of become more negative, do you just -- is 2023 a year that you can still get OR expansion sort of at or above 100 basis points? Or are you going to start bumping up against fixed costs fairly soon?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think the thing that we typically see in the past, and you can look at sort of 2016, 2019, as an example, is when we get into an environment where revenue is flat to down overall, that's something where we are going to continue to invest, like Greg mentioned in his comments earlier, we're going to continue to invest for the long term. And so that often creates a little headwind, if you will, on the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. But the OR change that we saw in '16 and '19, the slight deterioration in those periods was pretty much limited to that change in depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. We certainly are looking to manage all of our variable costs to match what those revenue volume trends are. We'll be looking for productivity. And we'll be looking closely at every dollar that we spend. We certainly want to spend dollars when there's an appropriate return that's there and don't want to do anything that it might limit our long-term performance. But you just got to be careful when it comes to discretionary spending. So we've generally been able to manage all those other costs flat. Our cost structure is highly variable, more than 2/3, almost 3/4 of our cost over now. So we just continue to work those costs as best we can. Look for productivity in any way that we can save money to offset any kind of pressure we may be seeing on the top line.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Just a follow-up maybe on the cost front, looking ahead beyond even the current quarter, you talked about inflation. Is there any relief on the inflation front, whether it be on the wage side. I assume on the purchased transport side, but just sort of your thoughts on sort of the cost inflation environment as we move beyond this? What you're seeing today?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, from a core inflation standpoint, as we go into next year, I think everybody in this country is probably hoping for seeing some type of relief. And really, I think that starts with we've got to have improvement on the energy side. Energy drives inflation overall for this country, and we've got to see some type of movement there. And I think that gives -- kind of removes the hurdle of uncertainty for many business owners and our customers because then it should control what the Fed action may be. And so once you get those, then I think at least cleared, you get reinvestment back in businesses and so forth and hopefully start seeing freight flows once again a little bit stronger at the levels that we anticipated when we started this year. But for us, in particular, salary wages and benefits are probably 65% of our total cost. And we did just give a wage increase at the 1st of September this year, rewarding our employees for the performance that they've been able to produce over this last year. And so we control that element of inflation. Certainly, on the benefit side, we've seen a little bit higher cost later on some of the medical costs in particular. But as we continue to improve pay time off benefits and some of those other features that we've rewarded employees with. Another 15% of our costs there are the operating supplies and expenses. Fuel is obviously a big component. I think our surcharge program has been effective at offsetting the increase there, and we hope that we'll see a decrease as we make our way through 2023. And that should help on some of the parts and other component tires and so forth that we've taken big increases on this year. And then certainly, on the depreciation side, with respect to equipment, we've taken some increases there. We hope some of those moderate as we get into next year as well. We haven't finalized what our equipment orders and what pricing and so forth will look like. But those are some of the biggest elements. We certainly have faced increased insurance premiums like every other carrier over the past several years and again, it's just you got to keep looking for ways that when you know you got an increase in one area. So you've got to try to find some savings in the other. And the biggest area for us will be to continue to focus on improved productivity with salaries, wages and benefits being our biggest cost element, we can offset. We control the inflation, but we can help ourselves by continuing to drive improved performance in those areas.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Adam, I wanted to just follow up. I thought I heard you say that core inflation is now tracking above some of the recent pricing increases you're getting. That feels like a pretty big change just for third quarter rent per shipment ex fuel is up 9%. So just add a little bit of color or clarity to what you're saying there.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, just mainly talking about what we've seen in terms of cost on a per shipment basis. And sometimes those per shipment costs increase a little bit more when you're in a little bit softer environment overall. I mean we've still got a positive spread in terms of when you look at revenue per shipment performance versus its cost per shipment. And we certainly think that can continue overall. And that's -- the focus is always to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread overall and what we can get on a revenue per shipment basis with the fuel versus what the cost per shipment with the fuel can be as well. But just looking at things on a pure cost per shipment basis is certainly trending a lot higher than what I had thought. I thought we would see moderation in the back half of this year, as we started comping against some of the increased inflationary items that we experienced in the second half of '21, but certainly, that moderation hasn't happened. So we're still seeing some pretty big increases, and I think a lot of it is driven by these increased fuel prices that have just remained high throughout the year. We thought we were going to start seeing some relief a few weeks ago on that as it started trending down a little bit the last 2, 3 weeks. I think it's back up about $0.50 over where we had dropped to a bit prior. But no, no change in terms of of what we're going to be looking for from an increased standpoint and what we think we can achieve because again, we've got to have cost plus pricing in our business that offset that inflation, but more importantly, to keep supporting the reinvestment back in our business.\nScott Group: So you weren't trying to imply that pricing is all of a sudden slowing a lot or anything like that.\nAdam Satterfield: No, not at all. And if I said that, I misspoke for sure. Now we're really pleased, I think when you look at in terms of the yield trends that we've had all year. They certainly have been very positive, and that's continuing into October. And we didn't -- I gave the number in terms of what we're seeing from a -- at least as of right now, what the tonnage is doing. But certainly, that implies that, that revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel is pretty consistent with where we were, maybe a touch higher for the third quarter overall. And so we would certainly expect that as we continue to go through renewals, generally, mix has held comps in that number increases sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, that will be the objective as we have increases coming due, and we'll be coming up fairly soon on the general rate increase as well. They will apply to about 25% of our business. But all of those factors, we've not really seen any change in the pricing environment. It's remained steady throughout this year. And certainly, this quarter the increases we've been able to get.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChristian Wetherbee: Adam, I just wanted to make sure I understood the sequential cadence in operating ratio from 3Q to 4Q. I think you said it was maybe 400 basis points plus or minus relative to the 69.1%. I just want to make sure that, that is right. And then as you think about sort of the potential variables that maybe you could add to that. I guess that would kind of get you closer to OR -- flattish OR on a year-over-year basis, I think you're still below it based on the guidance. But I wanted to get a sense of conceptually as we start to string out over the next few quarters, what are some of the dynamics that could then start to potentially push a deterioration in the operating ratio?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean, obviously, the top line is the biggest element. Certainly, when you've got revenue, that covers a lot of cost and some of those fixed cost elements that we have. But you have the 400 basis point, plus or minus, that was off the 69.1 reported operating ratio. And obviously, just the delta versus the normal cadence, the biggest being that 100 basis point benefit that was onetime in nature that was recorded in the third quarter. But yes, we certainly transition into the next year. Typically, the first quarter is about 100 basis points worse than the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of '22, we had a 70 basis point improvement. So we know we've got some tougher comparisons coming up from both a top line standpoint and an operating ratio standpoint, just given the phenomenal performance that we've had this year. And it's almost 300 basis points improvement in the operating ratio from a year-to-date standpoint. So it's been an incredibly strong year coming off of the improvement that we made in 2021. I mean the -- had $1.2 billion of revenue growth in, and we put another $900 million year-to-date on top of that. So in a probably a negative GDP environment. So I think we're probably in a stronger position than we've ever been in terms of going through a slower macro environment with respect to the relationships that we had with our customers. We mentioned earlier, we've not lost any business that we've got to try to go back and regain, if you will. It's just going to be a function of when our customers have more freight to be able to give to us. And so that's encouraging. I've mentioned that I feel like the October trend is encouraging as well. So just be a function of getting through kind of this winter and seeing where that baseline becomes where we finished the fourth quarter of this year from a volume standpoint and then getting through 1Q. And like I mentioned, seeing if we can't start getting some of that seasonal buildup that we would typically see coming to us early next year. But again, a lot of it in terms of an OR standpoint is it becomes more challenging to get year-over-year improvements in a flattish or a down revenue environment. But like I mentioned before, for us, it's -- we're going to manage all of our variable costs and then just sort of keep investing. So we might see some loss there on the depreciation line, but that's something that we know once that volume returns to the business. And we say to produce long-term operating ratio improvement takes improvements in density and yield. So once it starts coming back to us, we've proven what we can do in terms of the model. And so getting that throughput through the system, I think we can start working and trying to achieve the long-term operating ratio goal that we laid out at the end of last year of producing a sub-70 annual operating ratio.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes. Okay. That makes sense. And then you guys have done historically a good job of outperforming on a tonnage basis relative to peers, both I think in up cycles as well as down cycles. I guess as you think about this one, maybe with -- maybe more of your competitors leaning in from a growth perspective. I don't know if you would agree with that comment first off. But how do you sort of see that relative performance opportunity for you as you go through what could be a softer period over the course of the next year or so?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, a lot of times, our market share has been flatter, if you will, like, again, looking at 2016 and 2019, as recent examples. But for the last 3 quarters, while we've been still producing really solid volume growth, if you back us out at least from the public carrier group, volumes have been negative on a year-over-year basis going back to 4Q of last year. And really just looking at total tonnage, it's kind of on an average basis was flattish pretty much since the first quarter of '21 through second quarter of '22. So we've certainly significantly increased our market share when you look at the volumes and the revenue trends for us through these last couple of years. But a lot of times, like I said, it's just -- it may be a point where we may get to where we're sort of flattish, if you will, with the group. But right now, it just -- it feels a little bit different. And that's what I mean by we've not lost when I look at our national account reporting talking to customers. There's more conversations about the value add that -- how we help customer supply chains really over these last couple of years as people have dealt with the pandemic and supply chain challenges. And what we were able to do in '21, in particular, while there were a lot of capacity issues within the industry and to be able to support our customers and their growth and try to keep their networks and supply chain balanced. I think that's gone a long way. We've proven our value proposition. And so that's why I think we're in a better spot than perhaps we've ever been. So whenever we come out of this slower economic environment to really start building on the market share levels that we currently have in place. So yes, that's kind of what we've seen in the past and certainly where we think we might be, but where we've been flattish, we might still see a little positive delta from a share standpoint through the group. Certainly, we've been in probably 3 straight quarters of negative GDP. And when you compare our volume performance versus the other public carriers at least, there's probably been a wider spread there perhaps in other times in the past.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Adam, I don't know if you mentioned this before, but you talked about October being a little bit better. Can you just quantify that for us? Like typically, obviously, what's the historical shipment volume or tonnage role from October, September to October versus what it was? And then less of a nitpicky question. I guess I'm not so worried about Old Dominion's ability to see a positive spread between revenue and cost per shipment. I think you've done it 10 in the last 15 years because obviously, the MASTIO data and the service and you guys are just best in class there. But I guess the question really is the industry's ability to see positive yield ex-fuel growth next year. And some of this is a pricing discipline question for the industry, which I ask every quarter, but I just want to get your perspective in terms of what you think the industry's ability to see yield ex-fuel positive pricing is next year based on everything you're seeing out there from a pricing perspective?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes. One, thank you for recognizing the service performance. And certainly, as we said, service supports yield. You can't go into an account at a renewal. You've had service failures and so forth and have had rolling embargoes and missed pickups, late deliveries, damage shipments, those types of things and to be able to get the consistent increases like we've been able to achieve really going back for many years now. But that is a differentiated quality from us versus the group as well as I think that we look for consistency with our program is not necessarily whose favor is the market today versus tomorrow. We just want to build in a fair approach that tries to create win-win scenarios for us and for our customers. They know what the -- how to forecast and plan for from an expense standpoint. But more importantly, they can recognize the value, and there's a difference between price and cost. And I think we're increasingly seeing customers recognize that value that we're able to deliver for them. But -- so we certainly will continue with our initiatives, and I can't comment on what the other carriers will be doing and what their strategies will be going forward. But I think that, like I mentioned, the last 3 quarters, the other carriers at least, have been negative from a volume standpoint and have continued to push pricing. So it's hard to imagine that, that changes. It certainly seems like that's been favorable to their financial results. There's been general improvement and industry dynamics appears. But yes, our yield philosophy has been different from the group for many years, and certainly it's been rewarding for us and has allowed us to do a lot of things in terms of the investment cycle and the dollars that we've been able to put into our system, to keep growing and to have the baseline. We've probably got 25% excess capacity in the system today. And so we know we're building up from that next big way if the growth comes to us, and we're confident in what our long-term market share capabilities should be and feel like that we can get through the challenges of the short term and softer economic environment. But it's what you do in those upcycles that really make a difference. And so you have a lot of encouraging trends, if you will, for us and just we want to make sure that we stay ahead of the game and have got the capacity, we've got the people and we've got the fleet to be able to take advantage of the next up cycle whenever it starts.\nAmit Mehrotra: And what about the October versus September data point?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, sure. From a tonnage standpoint, and again, keep in mind, we typically don't even talk about the details. We just give sort of an average change in the revenue. But just knowing the sensitivity around at this point. But the number will change a little bit as we finish out these final few days of the month. But right now, what we're seeing from a month-to-date standpoint. It looks like that we're going to be pretty much right in line with the normal sequential change for October. Typically, October decreases about 3.5% sequentially versus September. And we're right in that ballpark. And certainly, it can move around a little bit as we finish out the month. But that's really the first time since February of this year, but the numbers have pretty much been in alignment. So we'll look and see. There's not necessarily a positive catalyst coming, if you will. But if we can kind of keep touch and keep pace with normal sequential trends, the positive catalyst meaning in the economy right now. But if we can kind of keep pace with these normal sequentials as we go through 4Q and 1Q, then we have an idea of what type of buildup we might see sequentially as we start getting into the spring of next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nTodd Fowler: So Adam, I think you've touched on this in a couple of different ways on the call here, but I just wanted to kind of square up the comments on the weight per shipment. It was up in the third quarter. It sounds like it's still trending positive. But your comments about customers seeing less demand, I would think that, that would have some impact where there just be less freight on each pallet. So can you just talk a little bit about the mix and what's been going on with weight per shipment? It seems like it's in the kind of a normalized level, but just want to make sure that that's the right way to think about it right now.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. It -- from a sequential standpoint, it decreased about 10 pounds from the second quarter to the third quarter. And right now in October, it's pretty much about the same as where we were right around 1,560 pounds, if you will. And so yes, if that trend held through the fourth quarter, then we would be looking at a decrease. We took action last year in terms of getting some of the heavier weighted shipments out of our system. Some of those spot quote systems shipments as well. Those spot quote of the total of our business have decreased as a result of what we're doing last year, really in an effort to protect capacity for our existing LTL customers and make sure that we can deliver what they needed. And -- but we started seeing an increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of '21 versus that low watermark that we hit in 3Q. So it went from 1,538 pounds up to 1,575 in 4Q and then increase further in the first quarter of this year to 1,589. And then since that point, it's been declining a bit. But yes, I mean that supporting last year was such a strong fourth quarter in terms of -- we ended up with an increase in our tons per day. It's typically down about 1.5% and we were actually up almost 2.5% sequentially versus the third quarter. So that strength as we went through 4Q was why we had such high expectations coming into this year, and it's just been sort of this flattish environment, if you will, from a volume standpoint all year. But yes, that's kind of what we've been seeing from a weight per shipment standpoint.\nTodd Fowler: Okay. No, that sounds -- I mean, tonnage being down a little bit the weight per shipment holding in, it seems like a decent combination all things considered. Just for a follow-up, I'm curious if you have any comments on headcount, it was down sequentially I guess is that's probably letting a little bit of attrition kind of run its course, and I don't think the fourth quarter is a big hiring period. But how should we think about the cadence of headcount either sequentially or year-over-year, just given the demand trends?\nGreg Gantt: Todd, I think you'll continue to see that trend track our shipments. Right now, like you said, we've been simply letting attrition take care of our needs or move it back in the right direction. But -- and we would continue to do that through the first quarter, which is typically our slowest quarter. But we aren't really hiring other filling vacancies and whatnot, but not much going on from that standpoint at this point in time.\nTodd Fowler: Got it. So you've got a little bit of a glide path for the next couple of quarters just on the attrition front.\nGreg Gantt: Yes, I think so. But keep in mind, we've continued to have driving schools and continue to work those and continue to get drivers trained because we know this thing will change at some point in time, and we'll come out on the other side in a better position certainly from -- I think, from a driver standpoint and certainly from a capacity standpoint. So I think we're doing some of the right things today to set the stage for when times do recover and get better and as has been in the past in our business, you know that time will come, hopefully, sooner than later.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Adam, I just wanted to follow up on some of the tonnage commentary already. Specifically, if we were to take a little bit of a glass half full approach here, I think you said in the start of the call that you kind of underperformed on share for like 3 to 4 quarters and already 3 quarters into it, if you historically look at like your tonnage stays negative for like 2 or 3 months maximum and you're already kind of pretty much all the way into that. You did say that you don't think that there is a positive catalyst on the horizon. But what are you looking for any potential signs of the cycle may be turning and we may be kind of in a restock kind of uptick position maybe in the next couple of months.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean, the biggest thing is just the conversations that we've had with customers. Like I said earlier, I think that there's just so much uncertainty in the market today. And that just gets in the psyche of business owners in terms of the risk that they're going to take for capital. I think there's still a labor issue and supply chain issue that is impacting many customers today. And we've heard first hand that just given the uncertainty out there with the economy that some customers have made the decision to not be as aggressive to feel open positions from a labor standpoint for fear of what may come on the demand side for their business. But I think that we certainly -- when you think about there's 3 big layers of uncertainty that people are facing right now, the upcoming midterm elections. And then after that, you've got clarity at least for the next couple of years. But then comes to the energy issue that it's got to be dealt with. We've got to see some type of improvement overall in terms of where fuel prices are and the impact that has on overall inflation for the domestic economy. And I think that if that riddle get solved, then you get some clarity in terms of the interest rate environment. And so I think we've got to start knocking some of those down to get back into a growth type of mode. But even when we look back at prior periods, be it even looking as bad as 2009 was, we started getting growth and the sequential growth that is in the spring of that year. So we had a really bad 4Q '08 and 1Q from a sequential standpoint, like many businesses did. But looking at 2016, another slower environment, same kind of thing where the fourth quarter of '15, things are slowing down. We kind of went through the winter. We started getting build up back in the spring. At some point, people have got to get some inventory back in the system and now there's been a lot of conversation about inventories. But frankly, we continue to face issues in terms of getting parts. Many of our customers give us the same feedback that they don't have the right levels of the inventories in the right places. So that creates freight demand. And we still look at an inventory to sales ratio that's lower than pre-pandemic levels. So I think there's certainly a lot of factors that have got to be dealt with, but just having those conversations with customers and our sales team is doing that on a day in and day out basis. We're trying to figure out what their plans are going into next year, and we take those from each of our sales account representatives, each of our service center imagers at our 255 locations and tried to build that into somewhat a baseline forecast plan to build around from an equipment planning standpoint, headcount planning, service center capacity plan. But that's the best feedback. You can read all the economic reports in the world, but the best is feedback we get from the ground up to help us plan for our business.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I apologize if I missed this and you said it, but are you seeing any signs of TL players kind of trying to encroach into the LTL market kind of given how loose things are on the TL side?\nAdam Satterfield: Not really. And the reason for that is where that may come into play and has in the past, say, back in a 2018 time frame would be on some of those spot quote-type shipments. Before the strategic actions that we took last year spot quote shipments are like 8,000 to 10,000 pound type loads. And historically, 10,000 pounds somewhat defined the LTL industry. But those heavier shipments, you might have a truckload carrier come in and try to build multiple stops or just be willing to take 1 mode, if you will, and not with that spillover type of freight. But the actions that we took last year were designed to try to get some of that freight that wouldn't be as sticky proactively out of our system. And so as a result, those spot quote shipments that used to average maybe 5% of our total, so a small number overall. It's probably more like 1% to 2% at this point. So we were fortunate that we proactively tried to flush some of that out of the network, really designed us to make sure that we were protecting our consistent LTL shippers and the capacity means that they had, in particular last year and what we thought was going to transpire this year as well. But I don't think looking at some of our competitors wait for shipments that I think some other companies took a similar approach. I don't think that's as big of a kind of a challenge to work through the past. There's -- that freight would swing back into truckload. It creates somewhat a vacuum effect that other carriers would look to feel. I don't think that risk is out there as much as it has been in prior cycles.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Following up on Todd's headcount question. If I look at your shipments per employee, they're still, call it, 8% below where they were this quarter in 2019. Can you talk a little bit about maybe a more bottoms-up look at productivity and your own metrics? How does productivity compare to history on the dock right now? How does the driver productivity compare? And just -- is there an opportunity in some of these tops-down metrics that we can calculate to get back to historic levels in a weaker demand environment? Or does it make sense to stay a little long head count in a structurally tighter labor market?\nGreg Gantt: Yes. I'll answer the last part of your question first, Bascome, but I think it definitely does make sense to stay a little long from a labor standpoint because -- we -- as we've talked about on prior calls, we had to work on an awful lot of harbor in the recent past to ramp up from a driver standpoint, particularly that we have in over the years. It's just much more difficult on like the market, was a heck of a lot tighter, and we did work an awful lot harder than we always had in years before to ramp up. So for sure, we will be a little more diligent on trying to maintain that driver force and keep it as high a level as we possibly can without negatively affecting productivity. To go back to the general productivity question. We're starting to see some improvements from market improvement on the platform, which is a good thing, and it's pretty typical when we get in this environment. Our labor force becomes better trained and more experienced, and we start to see the positive improvement cause change. And we are seeing that now. So that's certainly a good thing. Certainly, we struggle a little bit on the P&D side, the pickup and delivery side because we're obviously just not picking up the same number of shipments that at each stop that we were doing when we were ready to buy. So that's certainly more of a challenge. Your miles between stops and that kind of thing become a little greater and is certainly more difficult to keep up from that standpoint. So obviously, we'll continue to focus on those. We always think we have room for improvement both P&D and platform and from a load factor standpoint. So we're continuing to stay laser-focused on those kind of things and continue to try to drive some cost out when we can and where we can.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Matt on for Bruce. Curious to get your current view on net capacity in the industry and maybe how you might expect it to trend over the next couple of years here.\nGreg Gantt: Well, certainly, I think in this type of environment, there's certainly capacity out there much more so than it was last year back in the mid-2021 and prior. But I think we were the only one that maybe wasn't really suffering from a capacity standpoint. Certainly, we were in better shape than most. And as Adam had mentioned before, we spend an awful lot of money to ramp up from capacity. And I think we've done an extremely good job of that. We continue to stay focused on building capacity. And like I mentioned before, we'll come out of this thing hopefully sooner than later, and we'll be in good shape. But I think there is some capacity obviously out there now. We don't see the same things going on this year that we did last year when carriers were in trouble, they set in bargains and various things to limit pickups and whatnot. And certainly, we're not seeing or hearing about those kind of things now. So yes, there's capacity obviously. But I think the question is, what's everybody doing to try to ramp up the need arises on the other side. And you know what we're doing. We've got a large number of capacity increasing projects underway now, and we'll keep working on those. And again, like I said, be in better shape when volumes do change and when we start to pick back up. So we feel good about where we are. And honestly, what the others do, they do. And we can't -- certainly, can't control that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Lastly, are you guys seeing any changes or differences in underlying demand by specific end market or geography?\nAdam Satterfield: No. We've probably seen a little bit better performance with our industrial-related accounts once again in the most recent quarter. It probably grew a couple of hundred basis points faster than the overall company average revenue growth rate. And on the retail side, it was probably a couple of hundred basis points below but overall still seeing growth in all segments, if you will, but there's probably a little bit better performance on the industrial side. And most of our regions, you got some growing a little bit more than others when we look at it. But most are saying fairly balanced, which is a good thing. It's helped us be able to effectively reduce our purchase transportation, which was a positive for the third quarter were effectively back to prepandemic levels in the sense that we're essentially fully insourced again, and that's where we wanted to be because we know that improves our service value overall. And so that's been a positive trend, if you will. But if you don't have somewhat consistent growth in all those regions, you can get a little bit out of balance, and we might not have been able to achieve that objective. So that's been a positive development, at least to help from a service and a cost standpoint.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's super helpful. Congratulations again on the exceptional performance.\nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. It's Tom Wadewitz. Just -- I think, Adam, you gave quite a bit of commentary on September, October, but I don't know if you offered what the revenue per hundredweight was kind of trending in October ex fuel. Can you give us kind of a sense of that? Is that kind of stable? Or where is that at?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, pretty stable. Tom, I didn't give a specific number, so to speak, but I just mentioned that it's right in line, maybe a little bit better than what we saw the average for the third quarter. We were up 7.2%, the revenue per hundredweight in the third quarter, excluding fuel surcharge and right about that same level in October.\nThomas Wadewitz: So do you think that, that's kind of the level you stabilize at? I mean, I guess you talked about inflation being maybe a bit more stickier, higher than you thought. I think we normally think of maybe 4% to 5% as being what's a normal growth in revenue per hundredweight to get a bit more than inflation. But I guess if you're running with higher inflation, you got to get more price, right? So you think that's the right level? Or do you think that in a weaker -- kind of a weak rate market, you're going to see that decelerate a bit further as you go into 2023?\nAdam Satterfield: No, I think that when you look at our long-term revenue per shipment performance, so a little bit different than the per 100. But long-term revenue per shipment, we've been able to average between 4.5% to 5%. And that's -- I think whether you look at it in certain years, including fuel or excluding fuel, that's kind of been the goal because long term, our cost per shipment performance has been kind of in that 3% to 3.5% range mainly the increase is that we give to our employees each year from the wage improvement. But we certainly -- we've face the increased cost of equipment and insurance premiums and fortunately have been able to offset some of those other inflationary items through improved productivity and efficiencies within our operations. But we're certainly -- we'll have the same objectives as we go through the rest of this fourth quarter and as we transition into next year as well. Looking at the per hundred, certainly, we had bigger increases in 2021. Some of that started particularly in the back half of the year when inflation was picking up, and this year has been solid increases as well. But the key is just this contracts renewed and they renewed throughout the year for us is to continue to make improvement. So it's -- we work a continuous improvement cycle, whether it's with our yield management, the efficiency of their operations. Every department is looking at continuous improvement. And certainly, we've got to continue with our best efforts there on the yield side. But I think that we'll see core inflation. We certainly hope that, that moderates as we transition into next year. So we shouldn't need as big of an increase perhaps as what we've seen the last two. But certainly, we want to see sequential increases from quarter-to-quarter.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Adam, just two quick follow-ups for you. First, on the PT brought it up and then answer a couple of questions ago, 2.1% as far as I can tell, is about as low as it's ever been in your network. So as you contemplate keeping maybe more resources from a headcount perspective just because of the challenges in hiring. Is there any more room to flex PT? Or are you kind of at the absolute minimum there? And we think about it holistically, salaries, wages and benefits plus PT probably stays a little bit elevated for the foreseeable future.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, that level where we are, we effectively in the third quarter, didn't use any PT within our domestic line haul network. That balance that we've historically had that generally trends between 2% to 2.5% of revenue reflects mainly our -- as we have a little small truckload brokerage operation. So you've got those carrier costs there and then the partners that we have with our Canadian operation as well. Those purchase transportation costs are in that baseline number. So certainly, I wouldn't necessarily expect that to get much lower as a percent of revenue, unless something is changing with those businesses, which we don't foresee. But they get nothing really out there to call, if you will, as it impacts the domestic operation. We certainly flexed up as we went through the balance of 2021 primarily using that PT to supplement our workforce and to a degree, our fleet where some of what I mentioned earlier, we had some regions that were growing much stronger, like coming off the rest as we came out of pandemic was growing incredibly strong and can get your fleet out of balance, if you don't appropriately manage. So that was some of why we were using a little bit of PT as well. It's just to keep the network overall in balance.\nJonathan Chappell: Okay. That helps. And then also to tie a couple of things together. I mean, it sounded like you're pretty optimistic. I mean maybe optimistic is a strong word, but not as pessimistic regarding some of your customer commentary. But in your prepared remarks, I wrote down you said directly, demand just isn't there for some of your customers' freight. So do we foresee maybe a late peak season where it's not there today. But going into a time that might seasonally be slower, you start to see a reversion or a catch-up? Or do we kind of just write off the rest of this year as it's going to be weak and maybe things are rightsized by '23 and start to see a pickup then?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. For us, we don't have a peak season per se. Usually, September is our busiest month of the year just from a function of the seasonality in our business. And we have pretty consistent seasonal trends year in and year out as we progress, whether it's week-by-week within the months and then month-by-month through the quarters. But nevertheless, I mean, certainly, some of the months that we had in the earlier part of the year coming off the strength of how we finish '21. And it looks like March will be our busiest month in terms of just the average weight and shipments, if you will. But yes, it's just managing through kind of the base levels where we are. Looking at, I mentioned earlier that when we get -- whether it's an up cycle or a down cycle, a lot of times will have 3 to 5 quarters where we either outperform or underperform normal seasonality. And so the third quarter was the third such quarter of underperformance. So we'll just continue to watch the trends, like I mentioned, what we've seen at least through the second and third quarters was just in the months where we see a lot of buildup. We didn't see that same type of acceleration. September, for example, that would normally be up sequentially about 4%, we were up about 0.5%. So will we get the buildup in November? Remains to be seen, and then December kind of drops off. But I feel like if we can kind of somewhat say a little bit closer in touch with our normal sequential trends, through 4Q and 1Q next year, that's kind of looking at getting to the spring and seeing when we start seeing some volumes coming back to the business. 2Q of this year, it's quite a bit different. We're used to seeing volumes increase sequentially about 7.5% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and we were up about 0.7%. So we just haven't had that buildup that we otherwise would see. But yes, it's just going to be a function of kind of getting through and watching these developments. But October generally sets the trend when we look back for the fourth quarter and look back at some prior periods where we were kind of in or going into an economic slowdown, you've had a lot more underperformance, if you will, with October versus September. So that was something that we've been closely watching internally makes us feel a little bit better as we really get into the winter months where we're always going to be a little bit seasonally slower. So it's just a function of continuing to execute on the plan and adjusting as need be to what the overall volume environment dictates. And then just trying to stay engaged with our customers and figure out we would really see that spring build up next year or not. And then all the while, we're probably focusing a little bit more on sequential trends now. Certainly, again, from a year-over-year standpoint, the fourth quarter was so strong. We kind of knew the fourth quarter and the first quarter from a year-over-year standpoint, we're going to need much harder comparisons on the volume side. So that's why we're probably paying a little bit closer attention now to how some of the seasonality has played out for us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Just one question for me, and it's sort of been asked in different ways, but how should we think about the industry's continued ability to gain pricing above cost inflation with many larger LTL carriers sort of expanding capacity into a downturn? Is that something we should be concerned about? Or is the fact that we're seeing so much cost inflation across to everybody's network that we should remain confident that everyone is going to maintain pricing discipline that we've seen over the last decade.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Well, we've certainly -- like I mentioned, we've -- the carrier group on average to exclude us has seen negative volumes on a year-over-year basis through the last 3 quarters. And -- but has continued to increase their yields. And so we wouldn't anticipate a lot of change from that. With respect to whether capacity is really being added or not remains to be seen. We've not seen really any material addition. Some people are talking about it. There have been 1 other carrier, I guess, that certainly has increased their service in account. But when you look at the industry, at least the public carriers on average over the last 10 years, there has been a decrease in industry capacity. So don't really foresee a lot of change in that regard as we move forward. But certainly, we'll continue to watch it. But yes, we believe the industry will stay disciplined, but we know what our plan is, what we can control, and we'll continue to control the elements that we can and what the other carriers do will just continue to sort of watch and see. But I think we've got a long-term track record in terms of what we've been able to do over the last 10 years. We've averaged growing our revenue 11% a year, and we certainly have made improvements to the operating ratio along the way. And again, it's been through a combination of consistent improvements in yield and then the density through that -- the volume throughput in the system that's allowed us to produce this consistent operating ratio improvement and different carriers have had different strategies along the way. And certainly recent periods, other carriers have been increasing rates faster than us, but we don't control what they do, but we'll continue to certainly watch. But our conversations with customers are what's going on within Old Dominion, what our cost inflation looks like, the investments that we want to make to help support our customers and the growth in their business. And ultimately, what's the value that we can add to our customer supply chains. And those are the conversations we have versus trying to compare our price versus someone else's price. It's all about value, and that's service value is what has won the day for us and what will continue to drive our ability to win market share in the long term.\nJason Seidl: Well, clearly, your game plan has worked. So I think sticking with it is a good thing.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: Just Adam, just to balance out your last comment there. your 100 basis point revenue over cost you noted before, but also noting higher inflation. I just want to understand, you still target the kind of 50 to 100 basis point operating ratio improvement on a full year going forward? Or does that change if volumes are weaker here?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think we talked a little bit about this earlier, certainly in periods where revenue has been flat or been down. We've had a little bit of OR degradation and generally limited to the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. And the reason for that is we want to continue to invest for the long-term market share opportunities, we believe we have. And certainly, when you look at the second quarter of 2020, we had a big decrease in revenue that year. But we were a lot more aggressive in terms of managing costs and actually improve the operating ratio of 10 basis points. But I think that looking more a 2016, 2019 for the general performance and doing some of the things that really protect our long-term opportunities, keeping a little bit of inflated headcount, like Greg mentioned earlier, continue with our investment cycle. Those are the types of long-term decisions that we want to make that improve our opportunities for out years to get prepared for maybe what a 2024, 2025 looks like versus just trying to focus too closely on the short term and what the first half of next year might otherwise look like. So certainly, a lot of it depends on the overall revenue environment and what we will see. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, but 2016 and 2019 are probably better examples to look at in terms of how we try to manage the business, manage all over variable cost flat as best we can or prevent any type of increase in deterioration there and those cost elements. And then just might see that those depreciation costs increasing as a percent of revenue because of the investment driving increased depreciation dollars and then you're denominated being potentially flat to down from a revenue standpoint.\nKenneth Hoexter: And then the percent of volume, you mentioned from the spot boards, but how about from the third-party carriers, brokers, does that shift in this kind of a market when things get softer, do you add more? Do you keep it steady? How do you think about that strategically?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean we've got good long-term relationships with many 3PLs. They're about 1/3 of our business overall. A lot of times, what you'll see in a slower macro environment. We're seeing this a little bit now is some of those levels that's 3PL driven that kind of flattened out a little bit. And so we'll continue to watch that, but certainly feel like that a lot of the big 3PL customers that we have, in some ways, can help us a sense of demonstrating the value independently to the shippers that they're potentially helping manage transportation services for and talking through what the different elements of value in terms of our superior service on time, pickups, on-time deliveries, load damages all those sorts of things that they're talking to someone that has just been solely focused on price in the past, they can help us talk more about value. So in some ways, that could be beneficial to us in a slower macro environment.\nKenneth Hoexter: So are you seeing that increase as a percentage? Or is it sticking -- does it just stick around that third level up and down in the market? Or are you already seeing a change?\nAdam Satterfield: No, it's remaining about 1/3. It's just -- the growth is flattening out a little bit with -- in terms of looking at the overall revenue with our 3PLs right now.\nKenneth Hoexter: And then last for me is the fuel. It seemed relatively neutral this quarter in terms of kind of a quarterly impact, I guess, versus a huge lag impact last quarter. Does that math sound right to you? And then our -- in your negotiations? Are customers kind of talking. I mean I know you keep raising your rates, but the customers push back even harder now? Are you -- is it a bigger struggle as you go through these negotiations given the volume environment?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, no. There's always a conversation about total all-in price, if you will, because that's ultimately the bill that the customer is paying. But for us, certainly, there was a slight decrease in the average price of fuel in the third quarter versus the second. So that's something we'll probably talk a little bit about or on the last call. But like I mentioned earlier, we hope that we see that continue to decrease. And I would just say looking at the impact, there's been a lot of questions about that. If we were to see a decrease in the impact of fuel surcharge and our philosophy is we want the fuel surcharge is just one element of pricing and whether fuel goes up or down, we hope that's neutral to the bottom line for us. And probably the best periods to go back and look if we are to get some type of material improvement in fuel prices 2015, the average price of diesel fuel was down about 30% that year. We were fortunate that we still had some volume growth going that year to help us have good revenue trends overall, and we were able to improve the operating ratio. The fuel dropped another 15% in 2016. That year was a little bit different in terms of the overall top line environment and a little bit more pressure from a volume standpoint. But we certainly would like to see overall the fuel price continue to drop. And certainly, that would decrease the all-in price that is being paid today.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Gantt for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: We thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. During the third quarter, the Old Dominion team extended the company's track record for double-digit growth in revenue and profitability. The third quarter of 2022 was our seventh straight quarter with double-digit revenue growth and the nice straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. These financial results reflect the ongoing strength and demand for our services as we continue to deliver value to our customers by providing superior service at a fair price. Consistently executing on this key element of our long-term strategic plan is critical to our continued ability to win long-term market share. We were pleased to provide our customers with 99% on-time service and a cargo claims ratio of 0.2% during the third quarter. Service means much more than just picking up and delivering our customers' freight on time and damage free. In fact, MASTIO & Company conducts a comprehensive industry study each year that most recently measured carriers on 28 service and value-related attributes. We are extremely proud that MASTIO recently named OD as the #1 LTL provider for the 13th straight year. And this latest survey, shippers and logistics professionals ranked OD as #1 for 24 of the 28 individual attributes. The consistency of our service performance over many years, as validated by MASTIO reflects the commitment from each of our team members who work hard every day to go above and beyond for our customers. Our superior service performance has not only allowed us to win market share over the long term. It has also supported our long-term yield management strategy. This simple strategy focuses on increasing our yields to offset our cost inflation each year while also supporting our ongoing investments in capacity. We have consistently invested 10% to 15% of our revenue in capital expenditures each year regardless of the economic environment. Investments in our fleet and technologies have helped us improve our operating efficiency and customer service, while the significant investments in our service center network generally support our growth. We have expanded the capacity of our service center network by over 50% in the past 10 years while doubling our market share, and we believe further investments will be necessary to ensure that our network is never a limiting factor to our growth. We believe a big part of our value proposition is having available capacities when our customers need it the most. The capacity advantage we have in the marketplace was especially critical for customers that dealt with various supply chain issues over the past 2 years, while industry capacity was generally limited. We increased our revenues by over $2 billion over the past 2 years, which would not have been possible if we had not consistently increased our network capacity. Our business model continues to prove itself time and again, and we are extremely grateful to our customers for their trust in us. Freight is a relationship business, and we believe our superior service, available network capacity and consistent approach to pricing have allowed us to strengthen our long-term relationships. We also believe the value offered by a carrier is becoming increasingly important to shippers, which is why we remain absolutely committed to executing on the fundamental elements of our long-term strategic plan. As a result, we will continue to focus on providing customers with superior service at a fair price. We will also continue to invest in our OD Family of employees, our fleet and our service center network to support our long-term growth initiatives. Old Dominion has the financial strength to make these investments, and as a result, we believe we are better positioned than any carrier to produce long-term profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Todd, I think you'll continue to see that trend track our shipments. Right now, like you said, we've been simply letting attrition take care of our needs or move it back in the right direction. But -- and we would continue to do that through the first quarter, which is typically our slowest quarter. But we aren't really hiring other filling vacancies and whatnot, but not much going on from that standpoint at this point in time. Yes, I think so. But keep in mind, we've continued to have driving schools and continue to work those and continue to get drivers trained because we know this thing will change at some point in time, and we'll come out on the other side in a better position certainly from -- I think, from a driver standpoint and certainly from a capacity standpoint. So I think we're doing some of the right things today to set the stage for when times do recover and get better and as has been in the past in our business, you know that time will come, hopefully, sooner than later. Yes. I'll answer the last part of your question first, Bascome, but I think it definitely does make sense to stay a little long from a labor standpoint because -- we -- as we've talked about on prior calls, we had to work on an awful lot of harbor in the recent past to ramp up from a driver standpoint, particularly that we have in over the years. It's just much more difficult on like the market, was a heck of a lot tighter, and we did work an awful lot harder than we always had in years before to ramp up. So for sure, we will be a little more diligent on trying to maintain that driver force and keep it as high a level as we possibly can without negatively affecting productivity. To go back to the general productivity question. We're starting to see some improvements from market improvement on the platform, which is a good thing, and it's pretty typical when we get in this environment. Our labor force becomes better trained and more experienced, and we start to see the positive improvement cause change. And we are seeing that now. So that's certainly a good thing. Certainly, we struggle a little bit on the P&D side, the pickup and delivery side because we're obviously just not picking up the same number of shipments that at each stop that we were doing when we were ready to buy. So that's certainly more of a challenge. Your miles between stops and that kind of thing become a little greater and is certainly more difficult to keep up from that standpoint. So obviously, we'll continue to focus on those. We always think we have room for improvement both P&D and platform and from a load factor standpoint. So we're continuing to stay laser-focused on those kind of things and continue to try to drive some cost out when we can and where we can. Well, certainly, I think in this type of environment, there's certainly capacity out there much more so than it was last year back in the mid-2021 and prior. But I think we were the only one that maybe wasn't really suffering from a capacity standpoint. Certainly, we were in better shape than most. And as Adam had mentioned before, we spend an awful lot of money to ramp up from capacity. And I think we've done an extremely good job of that. We continue to stay focused on building capacity. And like I mentioned before, we'll come out of this thing hopefully sooner than later, and we'll be in good shape. But I think there is some capacity obviously out there now. We don't see the same things going on this year that we did last year when carriers were in trouble, they set in bargains and various things to limit pickups and whatnot. And certainly, we're not seeing or hearing about those kind of things now. So yes, there's capacity obviously. But I think the question is, what's everybody doing to try to ramp up the need arises on the other side. And you know what we're doing. We've got a large number of capacity increasing projects underway now, and we'll keep working on those. And again, like I said, be in better shape when volumes do change and when we start to pick back up. So we feel good about where we are. And honestly, what the others do, they do. And we can't -- certainly, can't control that. We thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue grew 14.5% in the third quarter to $1.6 billion, and our operating ratio improved to 69.1%. The combination of these changes helped produce a 36% increase in earnings per diluted share for the quarter. Our revenue growth was due primarily to the 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight, which more than offset the 2.6% decrease in our LTL tons. We believe this decrease in LTL tons reflects the overall softness in the domestic economy that has generally caused a decrease in demand for our customers' products. Demand for our service has remained strong, however, as customers are continuing to take advantage of our value proposition. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 3.8% when compared to the second quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.6%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 1.2% in tons per day and an increase of 2.4% in shipments per day. At this point, in October, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 8% when compared to October 2021. This month-to-date revenue performance includes a decrease of approximately 7% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio improved to 69.1% with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our cost categories improved as a percent of revenue during the quarter, although our operating supplies and expenses increased 300 basis points due primarily to the rising cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products as well as the increased cost for parts and repairs to maintain our fleet. We more than offset the impact of this increase with the improvement in our salaries, wages and benefits and purchase transportation. The improvement in these expenses as a percent of revenue reflects our best efforts to effectively match all of our variable costs with current revenue and volume trends. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $514.2 million and $1.3 billion for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while capital expenditures were $181.7 million and $504.8 million for the same periods. We noted in our release this morning that our capital expenditures are now estimated to be $720 million for this year. The decrease from our prior estimate is primarily due to the timing of equipment deliveries that we expect to be pushed into next year. We will provide further details about our 2023 capital expenditure plan with our fourth quarter earnings release. We utilized $345.4 million and $1.1 billion of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first 9 months of 2022, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.4 million and $101.4 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2022 was 23.9% as compared to 25.2% in the third quarter 2021. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Sure. We'll test my memory, I guess, and see if I can remember all of those. But so for September, looking at on a year-over-year basis, our tonnage was down 5.4% and then shipments, those were, let's see here, shipments per day were down 6.8%. So we had a little bit of an increase in weight per shipment for the month. It was up about 1.5% overall. And so if you remember, we've talked before about the weight per shipment trend last year, the third quarter was our low watermark, if you will, where we were at a total of 1,538 pounds. So we did start seeing a sequential increase from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of last year. So that should somewhat normalize as we transition. Looking at things on a sequential basis for the tonnage, we did have in September about a 0.4% increase versus August. The 10-year average is a 3.9% increase. So similar, I think what we saw in the third quarter is similar to the second quarter. We did underperform for the total quarter, the average sequential trends in 2Q. And we did, again, this is the third straight quarter of underperformance, if you will, but we started out with the decrease in July, which is pretty typical. We were down 4%. The 10-year average is down 3%. And then we dropped a little bit further in August, which is normally about flattish. And then we just didn't see the sizable increase that we typically do in September. I will say that so far and obviously, there are still days to be finished for October, but we look like we are trending pretty much right in line with normal seasonality at this point, which I think is an encouraging trend. Certainly, a lot of work left to do as we go through the fourth quarter. Typically, we would see an increase in November and then it drops off in December. Normally, overall, you've got a decrease on average for the fourth quarter versus the third. Last year, we did have an increase, which makes the comps quite a bit tougher in the fourth quarter. And we anticipated that really is going into the beginning of this year, really. So I think it's just one of those things, like we said in our prepared remarks that certainly feels like demand for us. The feedback that we're getting from our customers has been positive. We're seeing good trends with our national account reporting. We're not losing customers. So things are all trending favorably in that regard. It's just a matter of the demand, we feel like is not out there for our customers' products, if you will. We're just not picking up as much freight for those same customers that we may be making stops every day at their locations. So just continuing to kind of work through these challenges, if you will. We certainly made adjustments all year. I think when you look at the operating ratio performance in general and what our service metrics are, we've been making adjustments to this lower-than-anticipated volume environment that we've been in. But we typically, when we've been in a down cycle, we've been in a negative GDP environment this year. A lot of times, we'll see 3 to 5 quarters where we kind of underperform our 10-year average. I always like to remind everyone that our 10-year average includes doubling their market share. But this, like I said, was the third quarter where we underperformed. We're going into the winter. That's always a little bit seasonally slower anyways. And so we feel like based on what we've been able to do so far this year producing over $900 million of revenue growth, good solid operating ratio improvement. We'll get through this winter and then perhaps we start seeing some build up once we get into the spring and I'm talking on a sequential basis, start seeing that build up back in the business once we get into the spring. Maybe sooner, obviously, a lot's going on with the economy. But that's some of the baseline for what we're thinking right now. Sure. Yes, for one, the fourth quarter, we usually have an annual actuarial assessment that can impact, if you just look at the raw numbers, the pure average. But it's usually about a 200 to 250 basis point sequential deterioration from 3Q to 4Q. And I think probably the appropriate target would be about a 400 basis points increase off of 69.1 that we had. And just talking through a few of those puts and takes that will go into it. And I'd say 400, probably plus or minus a little bit, just depending on -- in some cases, some of these expense items I'm about to talk about, but also the top line. But obviously, we've got -- we had a onetime item that favorably impacted our operating ratio by about 100 basis points in the third quarter. So kind of adding that back to normalized what our fringe benefit cost have been trending earlier this year. Then I think that similar to the 2Q to 3Q change in our general supplies and expenses, we generally see a little bit of improvement from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I expect that from a dollar standpoint, that should remain somewhat flattish, but as revenue is typically a little bit lower, we'd expect that to increase. Maybe 20 basis points from 3Q to 4Q. Depreciation is another item. We're still taking delivery of equipment. Normally, you kind of have all your depreciation in there, so I'd expect to see that continue, tick up a little bit. And then finally, our miscellaneous expenses, those have trended low throughout the year. Those are typically around about 0.5 point. I think we're at 20 basis points, 0.2% in the third quarter. So I expect that to normalize at some point as well. So some of those cost items just may create just a little bit of variance versus what the 10-year average might otherwise suggest. But you know us, I mean, we're looking at every dollar we can from a discretionary spending standpoint and we'll be managing productivity and other costs as tightly as we can as we continue to adjust to current top line revenue and volume trends. Yes, nothing major that we have not already been seeing certainly that our weight per shipment has been trending higher, as I mentioned, at least through the third quarter. And then our length of haul has been a bit lower as well. That's down almost 1%. So both of those metrics putting a little downward pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight metric. And which I think we've talked a little bit about that on the last earnings call. Overall, excluding the fuel surcharge, the revenue per hundredweight was up 7%. So we're still seeing good yield performance overall. And then those yields are mix metrics, if you will, somewhat reconcile how we got from the growth rate that we are seeing for the second quarter to the third quarter. But overall, as contracts are renewing, we're continuing to look for increases and design with our long-term philosophy is we always are looking to try to increase yields to offset our cost inflation. I would say, core inflation is probably a bit higher than what some of these increases we're getting right now just dealing with this inflationary environment. But we're always looking at things on a long-term basis. And so we're continuing to make progress on those renewals, try to get our cost-plus type pricing to ultimately support the investments that we're making back in the system. We've invested a lot in real estate capital expenditures. When you look over the last 10 years, it's been almost $4 billion of investment in total with about $2 billion going into our real estate network. So I think we've certainly done a good job of making sure we're investing ahead of growth, and we don't want the network to be a limiting factor to our ability to grow. And so it's been important to build in that capacity into the service center network, and it certainly makes years like 2021 and the growth that we've seen in revenue this year possible. Well, I think the thing that we typically see in the past, and you can look at sort of 2016, 2019, as an example, is when we get into an environment where revenue is flat to down overall, that's something where we are going to continue to invest, like Greg mentioned in his comments earlier, we're going to continue to invest for the long term. And so that often creates a little headwind, if you will, on the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. But the OR change that we saw in '16 and '19, the slight deterioration in those periods was pretty much limited to that change in depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. We certainly are looking to manage all of our variable costs to match what those revenue volume trends are. We'll be looking for productivity. And we'll be looking closely at every dollar that we spend. We certainly want to spend dollars when there's an appropriate return that's there and don't want to do anything that it might limit our long-term performance. But you just got to be careful when it comes to discretionary spending. So we've generally been able to manage all those other costs flat. Our cost structure is highly variable, more than 2/3, almost 3/4 of our cost over now. So we just continue to work those costs as best we can. Look for productivity in any way that we can save money to offset any kind of pressure we may be seeing on the top line. Well, from a core inflation standpoint, as we go into next year, I think everybody in this country is probably hoping for seeing some type of relief. And really, I think that starts with we've got to have improvement on the energy side. Energy drives inflation overall for this country, and we've got to see some type of movement there. And I think that gives -- kind of removes the hurdle of uncertainty for many business owners and our customers because then it should control what the Fed action may be. And so once you get those, then I think at least cleared, you get reinvestment back in businesses and so forth and hopefully start seeing freight flows once again a little bit stronger at the levels that we anticipated when we started this year. But for us, in particular, salary wages and benefits are probably 65% of our total cost. And we did just give a wage increase at the 1st of September this year, rewarding our employees for the performance that they've been able to produce over this last year. And so we control that element of inflation. Certainly, on the benefit side, we've seen a little bit higher cost later on some of the medical costs in particular. But as we continue to improve pay time off benefits and some of those other features that we've rewarded employees with. Another 15% of our costs there are the operating supplies and expenses. Fuel is obviously a big component. I think our surcharge program has been effective at offsetting the increase there, and we hope that we'll see a decrease as we make our way through 2023. And that should help on some of the parts and other component tires and so forth that we've taken big increases on this year. And then certainly, on the depreciation side, with respect to equipment, we've taken some increases there. We hope some of those moderate as we get into next year as well. We haven't finalized what our equipment orders and what pricing and so forth will look like. But those are some of the biggest elements. We certainly have faced increased insurance premiums like every other carrier over the past several years and again, it's just you got to keep looking for ways that when you know you got an increase in one area. So you've got to try to find some savings in the other. And the biggest area for us will be to continue to focus on improved productivity with salaries, wages and benefits being our biggest cost element, we can offset. We control the inflation, but we can help ourselves by continuing to drive improved performance in those areas. Well, just mainly talking about what we've seen in terms of cost on a per shipment basis. And sometimes those per shipment costs increase a little bit more when you're in a little bit softer environment overall. I mean we've still got a positive spread in terms of when you look at revenue per shipment performance versus its cost per shipment. And we certainly think that can continue overall. And that's -- the focus is always to try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread overall and what we can get on a revenue per shipment basis with the fuel versus what the cost per shipment with the fuel can be as well. But just looking at things on a pure cost per shipment basis is certainly trending a lot higher than what I had thought. I thought we would see moderation in the back half of this year, as we started comping against some of the increased inflationary items that we experienced in the second half of '21, but certainly, that moderation hasn't happened. So we're still seeing some pretty big increases, and I think a lot of it is driven by these increased fuel prices that have just remained high throughout the year. We thought we were going to start seeing some relief a few weeks ago on that as it started trending down a little bit the last 2, 3 weeks. I think it's back up about $0.50 over where we had dropped to a bit prior. But no, no change in terms of of what we're going to be looking for from an increased standpoint and what we think we can achieve because again, we've got to have cost plus pricing in our business that offset that inflation, but more importantly, to keep supporting the reinvestment back in our business. No, not at all. And if I said that, I misspoke for sure. Now we're really pleased, I think when you look at in terms of the yield trends that we've had all year. They certainly have been very positive, and that's continuing into October. And we didn't -- I gave the number in terms of what we're seeing from a -- at least as of right now, what the tonnage is doing. But certainly, that implies that, that revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel is pretty consistent with where we were, maybe a touch higher for the third quarter overall. And so we would certainly expect that as we continue to go through renewals, generally, mix has held comps in that number increases sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. And certainly, that will be the objective as we have increases coming due, and we'll be coming up fairly soon on the general rate increase as well. They will apply to about 25% of our business. But all of those factors, we've not really seen any change in the pricing environment. It's remained steady throughout this year. And certainly, this quarter the increases we've been able to get. Well, I mean, obviously, the top line is the biggest element. Certainly, when you've got revenue, that covers a lot of cost and some of those fixed cost elements that we have. But you have the 400 basis point, plus or minus, that was off the 69.1 reported operating ratio. And obviously, just the delta versus the normal cadence, the biggest being that 100 basis point benefit that was onetime in nature that was recorded in the third quarter. But yes, we certainly transition into the next year. Typically, the first quarter is about 100 basis points worse than the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of '22, we had a 70 basis point improvement. So we know we've got some tougher comparisons coming up from both a top line standpoint and an operating ratio standpoint, just given the phenomenal performance that we've had this year. And it's almost 300 basis points improvement in the operating ratio from a year-to-date standpoint. So it's been an incredibly strong year coming off of the improvement that we made in 2021. I mean the -- had $1.2 billion of revenue growth in, and we put another $900 million year-to-date on top of that. So in a probably a negative GDP environment. So I think we're probably in a stronger position than we've ever been in terms of going through a slower macro environment with respect to the relationships that we had with our customers. We mentioned earlier, we've not lost any business that we've got to try to go back and regain, if you will. It's just going to be a function of when our customers have more freight to be able to give to us. And so that's encouraging. I've mentioned that I feel like the October trend is encouraging as well. So just be a function of getting through kind of this winter and seeing where that baseline becomes where we finished the fourth quarter of this year from a volume standpoint and then getting through 1Q. And like I mentioned, seeing if we can't start getting some of that seasonal buildup that we would typically see coming to us early next year. But again, a lot of it in terms of an OR standpoint is it becomes more challenging to get year-over-year improvements in a flattish or a down revenue environment. But like I mentioned before, for us, it's -- we're going to manage all of our variable costs and then just sort of keep investing. So we might see some loss there on the depreciation line, but that's something that we know once that volume returns to the business. And we say to produce long-term operating ratio improvement takes improvements in density and yield. So once it starts coming back to us, we've proven what we can do in terms of the model. And so getting that throughput through the system, I think we can start working and trying to achieve the long-term operating ratio goal that we laid out at the end of last year of producing a sub-70 annual operating ratio. Well, a lot of times, our market share has been flatter, if you will, like, again, looking at 2016 and 2019, as recent examples. But for the last 3 quarters, while we've been still producing really solid volume growth, if you back us out at least from the public carrier group, volumes have been negative on a year-over-year basis going back to 4Q of last year. And really just looking at total tonnage, it's kind of on an average basis was flattish pretty much since the first quarter of '21 through second quarter of '22. So we've certainly significantly increased our market share when you look at the volumes and the revenue trends for us through these last couple of years. But a lot of times, like I said, it's just -- it may be a point where we may get to where we're sort of flattish, if you will, with the group. But right now, it just -- it feels a little bit different. And that's what I mean by we've not lost when I look at our national account reporting talking to customers. There's more conversations about the value add that -- how we help customer supply chains really over these last couple of years as people have dealt with the pandemic and supply chain challenges. And what we were able to do in '21, in particular, while there were a lot of capacity issues within the industry and to be able to support our customers and their growth and try to keep their networks and supply chain balanced. I think that's gone a long way. We've proven our value proposition. And so that's why I think we're in a better spot than perhaps we've ever been. So whenever we come out of this slower economic environment to really start building on the market share levels that we currently have in place. So yes, that's kind of what we've seen in the past and certainly where we think we might be, but where we've been flattish, we might still see a little positive delta from a share standpoint through the group. Certainly, we've been in probably 3 straight quarters of negative GDP. And when you compare our volume performance versus the other public carriers at least, there's probably been a wider spread there perhaps in other times in the past. Sure. Yes. One, thank you for recognizing the service performance. And certainly, as we said, service supports yield. You can't go into an account at a renewal. You've had service failures and so forth and have had rolling embargoes and missed pickups, late deliveries, damage shipments, those types of things and to be able to get the consistent increases like we've been able to achieve really going back for many years now. But that is a differentiated quality from us versus the group as well as I think that we look for consistency with our program is not necessarily whose favor is the market today versus tomorrow. We just want to build in a fair approach that tries to create win-win scenarios for us and for our customers. They know what the -- how to forecast and plan for from an expense standpoint. But more importantly, they can recognize the value, and there's a difference between price and cost. And I think we're increasingly seeing customers recognize that value that we're able to deliver for them. But -- so we certainly will continue with our initiatives, and I can't comment on what the other carriers will be doing and what their strategies will be going forward. But I think that, like I mentioned, the last 3 quarters, the other carriers at least, have been negative from a volume standpoint and have continued to push pricing. So it's hard to imagine that, that changes. It certainly seems like that's been favorable to their financial results. There's been general improvement and industry dynamics appears. But yes, our yield philosophy has been different from the group for many years, and certainly it's been rewarding for us and has allowed us to do a lot of things in terms of the investment cycle and the dollars that we've been able to put into our system, to keep growing and to have the baseline. We've probably got 25% excess capacity in the system today. And so we know we're building up from that next big way if the growth comes to us, and we're confident in what our long-term market share capabilities should be and feel like that we can get through the challenges of the short term and softer economic environment. But it's what you do in those upcycles that really make a difference. And so you have a lot of encouraging trends, if you will, for us and just we want to make sure that we stay ahead of the game and have got the capacity, we've got the people and we've got the fleet to be able to take advantage of the next up cycle whenever it starts. Yes, sure. From a tonnage standpoint, and again, keep in mind, we typically don't even talk about the details. We just give sort of an average change in the revenue. But just knowing the sensitivity around at this point. But the number will change a little bit as we finish out these final few days of the month. But right now, what we're seeing from a month-to-date standpoint. It looks like that we're going to be pretty much right in line with the normal sequential change for October. Typically, October decreases about 3.5% sequentially versus September. And we're right in that ballpark. And certainly, it can move around a little bit as we finish out the month. But that's really the first time since February of this year, but the numbers have pretty much been in alignment. So we'll look and see. There's not necessarily a positive catalyst coming, if you will. But if we can kind of keep touch and keep pace with normal sequential trends, the positive catalyst meaning in the economy right now. But if we can kind of keep pace with these normal sequentials as we go through 4Q and 1Q, then we have an idea of what type of buildup we might see sequentially as we start getting into the spring of next year. Yes. It -- from a sequential standpoint, it decreased about 10 pounds from the second quarter to the third quarter. And right now in October, it's pretty much about the same as where we were right around 1,560 pounds, if you will. And so yes, if that trend held through the fourth quarter, then we would be looking at a decrease. We took action last year in terms of getting some of the heavier weighted shipments out of our system. Some of those spot quote systems shipments as well. Those spot quote of the total of our business have decreased as a result of what we're doing last year, really in an effort to protect capacity for our existing LTL customers and make sure that we can deliver what they needed. And -- but we started seeing an increase sequentially in the fourth quarter of '21 versus that low watermark that we hit in 3Q. So it went from 1,538 pounds up to 1,575 in 4Q and then increase further in the first quarter of this year to 1,589. And then since that point, it's been declining a bit. But yes, I mean that supporting last year was such a strong fourth quarter in terms of -- we ended up with an increase in our tons per day. It's typically down about 1.5% and we were actually up almost 2.5% sequentially versus the third quarter. So that strength as we went through 4Q was why we had such high expectations coming into this year, and it's just been sort of this flattish environment, if you will, from a volume standpoint all year. But yes, that's kind of what we've been seeing from a weight per shipment standpoint. Well, I mean, the biggest thing is just the conversations that we've had with customers. Like I said earlier, I think that there's just so much uncertainty in the market today. And that just gets in the psyche of business owners in terms of the risk that they're going to take for capital. I think there's still a labor issue and supply chain issue that is impacting many customers today. And we've heard first hand that just given the uncertainty out there with the economy that some customers have made the decision to not be as aggressive to feel open positions from a labor standpoint for fear of what may come on the demand side for their business. But I think that we certainly -- when you think about there's 3 big layers of uncertainty that people are facing right now, the upcoming midterm elections. And then after that, you've got clarity at least for the next couple of years. But then comes to the energy issue that it's got to be dealt with. We've got to see some type of improvement overall in terms of where fuel prices are and the impact that has on overall inflation for the domestic economy. And I think that if that riddle get solved, then you get some clarity in terms of the interest rate environment. And so I think we've got to start knocking some of those down to get back into a growth type of mode. But even when we look back at prior periods, be it even looking as bad as 2009 was, we started getting growth and the sequential growth that is in the spring of that year. So we had a really bad 4Q '08 and 1Q from a sequential standpoint, like many businesses did. But looking at 2016, another slower environment, same kind of thing where the fourth quarter of '15, things are slowing down. We kind of went through the winter. We started getting build up back in the spring. At some point, people have got to get some inventory back in the system and now there's been a lot of conversation about inventories. But frankly, we continue to face issues in terms of getting parts. Many of our customers give us the same feedback that they don't have the right levels of the inventories in the right places. So that creates freight demand. And we still look at an inventory to sales ratio that's lower than pre-pandemic levels. So I think there's certainly a lot of factors that have got to be dealt with, but just having those conversations with customers and our sales team is doing that on a day in and day out basis. We're trying to figure out what their plans are going into next year, and we take those from each of our sales account representatives, each of our service center imagers at our 255 locations and tried to build that into somewhat a baseline forecast plan to build around from an equipment planning standpoint, headcount planning, service center capacity plan. But that's the best feedback. You can read all the economic reports in the world, but the best is feedback we get from the ground up to help us plan for our business. Not really. And the reason for that is where that may come into play and has in the past, say, back in a 2018 time frame would be on some of those spot quote-type shipments. Before the strategic actions that we took last year spot quote shipments are like 8,000 to 10,000 pound type loads. And historically, 10,000 pounds somewhat defined the LTL industry. But those heavier shipments, you might have a truckload carrier come in and try to build multiple stops or just be willing to take 1 mode, if you will, and not with that spillover type of freight. But the actions that we took last year were designed to try to get some of that freight that wouldn't be as sticky proactively out of our system. And so as a result, those spot quote shipments that used to average maybe 5% of our total, so a small number overall. It's probably more like 1% to 2% at this point. So we were fortunate that we proactively tried to flush some of that out of the network, really designed us to make sure that we were protecting our consistent LTL shippers and the capacity means that they had, in particular last year and what we thought was going to transpire this year as well. But I don't think looking at some of our competitors wait for shipments that I think some other companies took a similar approach. I don't think that's as big of a kind of a challenge to work through the past. There's -- that freight would swing back into truckload. It creates somewhat a vacuum effect that other carriers would look to feel. I don't think that risk is out there as much as it has been in prior cycles. No. We've probably seen a little bit better performance with our industrial-related accounts once again in the most recent quarter. It probably grew a couple of hundred basis points faster than the overall company average revenue growth rate. And on the retail side, it was probably a couple of hundred basis points below but overall still seeing growth in all segments, if you will, but there's probably a little bit better performance on the industrial side. And most of our regions, you got some growing a little bit more than others when we look at it. But most are saying fairly balanced, which is a good thing. It's helped us be able to effectively reduce our purchase transportation, which was a positive for the third quarter were effectively back to prepandemic levels in the sense that we're essentially fully insourced again, and that's where we wanted to be because we know that improves our service value overall. And so that's been a positive trend, if you will. But if you don't have somewhat consistent growth in all those regions, you can get a little bit out of balance, and we might not have been able to achieve that objective. So that's been a positive development, at least to help from a service and a cost standpoint. Yes, pretty stable. Tom, I didn't give a specific number, so to speak, but I just mentioned that it's right in line, maybe a little bit better than what we saw the average for the third quarter. We were up 7.2%, the revenue per hundredweight in the third quarter, excluding fuel surcharge and right about that same level in October. No, I think that when you look at our long-term revenue per shipment performance, so a little bit different than the per 100. But long-term revenue per shipment, we've been able to average between 4.5% to 5%. And that's -- I think whether you look at it in certain years, including fuel or excluding fuel, that's kind of been the goal because long term, our cost per shipment performance has been kind of in that 3% to 3.5% range mainly the increase is that we give to our employees each year from the wage improvement. But we certainly -- we've face the increased cost of equipment and insurance premiums and fortunately have been able to offset some of those other inflationary items through improved productivity and efficiencies within our operations. But we're certainly -- we'll have the same objectives as we go through the rest of this fourth quarter and as we transition into next year as well. Looking at the per hundred, certainly, we had bigger increases in 2021. Some of that started particularly in the back half of the year when inflation was picking up, and this year has been solid increases as well. But the key is just this contracts renewed and they renewed throughout the year for us is to continue to make improvement. So it's -- we work a continuous improvement cycle, whether it's with our yield management, the efficiency of their operations. Every department is looking at continuous improvement. And certainly, we've got to continue with our best efforts there on the yield side. But I think that we'll see core inflation. We certainly hope that, that moderates as we transition into next year. So we shouldn't need as big of an increase perhaps as what we've seen the last two. But certainly, we want to see sequential increases from quarter-to-quarter. Yes, that level where we are, we effectively in the third quarter, didn't use any PT within our domestic line haul network. That balance that we've historically had that generally trends between 2% to 2.5% of revenue reflects mainly our -- as we have a little small truckload brokerage operation. So you've got those carrier costs there and then the partners that we have with our Canadian operation as well. Those purchase transportation costs are in that baseline number. So certainly, I wouldn't necessarily expect that to get much lower as a percent of revenue, unless something is changing with those businesses, which we don't foresee. But they get nothing really out there to call, if you will, as it impacts the domestic operation. We certainly flexed up as we went through the balance of 2021 primarily using that PT to supplement our workforce and to a degree, our fleet where some of what I mentioned earlier, we had some regions that were growing much stronger, like coming off the rest as we came out of pandemic was growing incredibly strong and can get your fleet out of balance, if you don't appropriately manage. So that was some of why we were using a little bit of PT as well. It's just to keep the network overall in balance. Yes. For us, we don't have a peak season per se. Usually, September is our busiest month of the year just from a function of the seasonality in our business. And we have pretty consistent seasonal trends year in and year out as we progress, whether it's week-by-week within the months and then month-by-month through the quarters. But nevertheless, I mean, certainly, some of the months that we had in the earlier part of the year coming off the strength of how we finish '21. And it looks like March will be our busiest month in terms of just the average weight and shipments, if you will. But yes, it's just managing through kind of the base levels where we are. Looking at, I mentioned earlier that when we get -- whether it's an up cycle or a down cycle, a lot of times will have 3 to 5 quarters where we either outperform or underperform normal seasonality. And so the third quarter was the third such quarter of underperformance. So we'll just continue to watch the trends, like I mentioned, what we've seen at least through the second and third quarters was just in the months where we see a lot of buildup. We didn't see that same type of acceleration. September, for example, that would normally be up sequentially about 4%, we were up about 0.5%. So will we get the buildup in November? Remains to be seen, and then December kind of drops off. But I feel like if we can kind of somewhat say a little bit closer in touch with our normal sequential trends, through 4Q and 1Q next year, that's kind of looking at getting to the spring and seeing when we start seeing some volumes coming back to the business. 2Q of this year, it's quite a bit different. We're used to seeing volumes increase sequentially about 7.5% from the first quarter to the second quarter, and we were up about 0.7%. So we just haven't had that buildup that we otherwise would see. But yes, it's just going to be a function of kind of getting through and watching these developments. But October generally sets the trend when we look back for the fourth quarter and look back at some prior periods where we were kind of in or going into an economic slowdown, you've had a lot more underperformance, if you will, with October versus September. So that was something that we've been closely watching internally makes us feel a little bit better as we really get into the winter months where we're always going to be a little bit seasonally slower. So it's just a function of continuing to execute on the plan and adjusting as need be to what the overall volume environment dictates. And then just trying to stay engaged with our customers and figure out we would really see that spring build up next year or not. And then all the while, we're probably focusing a little bit more on sequential trends now. Certainly, again, from a year-over-year standpoint, the fourth quarter was so strong. We kind of knew the fourth quarter and the first quarter from a year-over-year standpoint, we're going to need much harder comparisons on the volume side. So that's why we're probably paying a little bit closer attention now to how some of the seasonality has played out for us. Yes. Well, we've certainly -- like I mentioned, we've -- the carrier group on average to exclude us has seen negative volumes on a year-over-year basis through the last 3 quarters. And -- but has continued to increase their yields. And so we wouldn't anticipate a lot of change from that. With respect to whether capacity is really being added or not remains to be seen. We've not seen really any material addition. Some people are talking about it. There have been 1 other carrier, I guess, that certainly has increased their service in account. But when you look at the industry, at least the public carriers on average over the last 10 years, there has been a decrease in industry capacity. So don't really foresee a lot of change in that regard as we move forward. But certainly, we'll continue to watch it. But yes, we believe the industry will stay disciplined, but we know what our plan is, what we can control, and we'll continue to control the elements that we can and what the other carriers do will just continue to sort of watch and see. But I think we've got a long-term track record in terms of what we've been able to do over the last 10 years. We've averaged growing our revenue 11% a year, and we certainly have made improvements to the operating ratio along the way. And again, it's been through a combination of consistent improvements in yield and then the density through that -- the volume throughput in the system that's allowed us to produce this consistent operating ratio improvement and different carriers have had different strategies along the way. And certainly recent periods, other carriers have been increasing rates faster than us, but we don't control what they do, but we'll continue to certainly watch. But our conversations with customers are what's going on within Old Dominion, what our cost inflation looks like, the investments that we want to make to help support our customers and the growth in their business. And ultimately, what's the value that we can add to our customer supply chains. And those are the conversations we have versus trying to compare our price versus someone else's price. It's all about value, and that's service value is what has won the day for us and what will continue to drive our ability to win market share in the long term. Well, I think we talked a little bit about this earlier, certainly in periods where revenue has been flat or been down. We've had a little bit of OR degradation and generally limited to the depreciation cost as a percent of revenue. And the reason for that is we want to continue to invest for the long-term market share opportunities, we believe we have. And certainly, when you look at the second quarter of 2020, we had a big decrease in revenue that year. But we were a lot more aggressive in terms of managing costs and actually improve the operating ratio of 10 basis points. But I think that looking more a 2016, 2019 for the general performance and doing some of the things that really protect our long-term opportunities, keeping a little bit of inflated headcount, like Greg mentioned earlier, continue with our investment cycle. Those are the types of long-term decisions that we want to make that improve our opportunities for out years to get prepared for maybe what a 2024, 2025 looks like versus just trying to focus too closely on the short term and what the first half of next year might otherwise look like. So certainly, a lot of it depends on the overall revenue environment and what we will see. There's a lot of uncertainty out there, but 2016 and 2019 are probably better examples to look at in terms of how we try to manage the business, manage all over variable cost flat as best we can or prevent any type of increase in deterioration there and those cost elements. And then just might see that those depreciation costs increasing as a percent of revenue because of the investment driving increased depreciation dollars and then you're denominated being potentially flat to down from a revenue standpoint. Well, I mean we've got good long-term relationships with many 3PLs. They're about 1/3 of our business overall. A lot of times, what you'll see in a slower macro environment. We're seeing this a little bit now is some of those levels that's 3PL driven that kind of flattened out a little bit. And so we'll continue to watch that, but certainly feel like that a lot of the big 3PL customers that we have, in some ways, can help us a sense of demonstrating the value independently to the shippers that they're potentially helping manage transportation services for and talking through what the different elements of value in terms of our superior service on time, pickups, on-time deliveries, load damages all those sorts of things that they're talking to someone that has just been solely focused on price in the past, they can help us talk more about value. So in some ways, that could be beneficial to us in a slower macro environment. No, it's remaining about 1/3. It's just -- the growth is flattening out a little bit with -- in terms of looking at the overall revenue with our 3PLs right now. Well, no. There's always a conversation about total all-in price, if you will, because that's ultimately the bill that the customer is paying. But for us, certainly, there was a slight decrease in the average price of fuel in the third quarter versus the second. So that's something we'll probably talk a little bit about or on the last call. But like I mentioned earlier, we hope that we see that continue to decrease. And I would just say looking at the impact, there's been a lot of questions about that. If we were to see a decrease in the impact of fuel surcharge and our philosophy is we want the fuel surcharge is just one element of pricing and whether fuel goes up or down, we hope that's neutral to the bottom line for us. And probably the best periods to go back and look if we are to get some type of material improvement in fuel prices 2015, the average price of diesel fuel was down about 30% that year. We were fortunate that we still had some volume growth going that year to help us have good revenue trends overall, and we were able to improve the operating ratio. The fuel dropped another 15% in 2016. That year was a little bit different in terms of the overall top line environment and a little bit more pressure from a volume standpoint. But we certainly would like to see overall the fuel price continue to drop. And certainly, that would decrease the all-in price that is being paid today."

Thank you for your cooperation.  At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead sir. \nGreg Gantt: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report that the OD team delivered strong profitable growth during the second quarter, which resulted in new company records for revenue and profitability. Our revenue increased 26.4% to $1.7 billion, while earnings per diluted share increased 42.9% to $3.30. We also improved our operating ratio by 280 basis points to 69.5%. This is the first time in our company's history that we have produced a sub-70% quarterly operating ratio. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan, which has guided us for many years and throughout many economic cycles. The disciplined execution of the business fundamentals that form this plan have supported our ability to double our market share over the past 10 years. We are confident that continued execution on this plan positions us to win additional market share over the next 10 years. The foundation for our ability to win market share is our relentless focus on providing superior service at a fair price. Our on-time service performance was 99% in the second quarter, while our cargo claims ratio improved to 0.1%. These service metrics reflect the efforts of our OD family of employees who maintain a steadfast commitment to delivering value to our customers each and every day. It appears that service quality is becoming even more important to customers when selecting a carrier which is why demand for our service has remained strong. This is a trend that began to develop with the economic recovery during the second half of 2020 and it continues today as many shippers are still struggling with supply chain issues. As a result, we believe our customer relationships have strengthened as we do our part to help our manufacturing customers keep their facilities running smoothly, while helping our retail customers keep products on the shelf and available for sale. Our value proposition also includes having sufficient capacity to support our customers when they need it the most. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open multiple new facilities during the second half of this year. These new facilities as well as various other expansion projects that we expect to complete should increase the amount of our excess capacity towards our longer term target of 25%. We remain committed to the ongoing expansion of our service center network, which we believe is important, regardless of the short-term macroeconomic outlook. Expanding service center capacity can take a significant amount of time, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes more apparent to shippers in tight environments, like we have seen in the past couple of years. With over $700 million of year-to-date revenue growth through June, we are on pace to exceed $1 billion of revenue growth for the second year in a row. We simply could not have achieved these types of numbers without the consistent investment in our service center capacity, as well as the continued investment in our fleet, technology and the training and education of our OD family of employees. Our team has shown tremendous flexibility over the past couple of years in response to significant changes in our business levels. And I am confident that this team will continue to build on its success. We have created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry, by executing on our long-term strategic plan, by providing superior service at a fair price and having the capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth, while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 26.4% in the second quarter was driven by the 22.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and 2.8% increase in LTL tons per day. Demand for our superior service remained strong during the quarter, which helped support the steady trend with our volumes and consistent yield improvements. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter increased 11.4%, when compared to the first quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 7.4% in tons per day and an increase of 7.8% in shipments per day. At this point in July, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 18%, when compared to July 2021, which continues to exceed our long-term average growth rate. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our second quarter operating ratio improved to 69.5%, with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in salaries, wages and benefits, as well as purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue, effectively offset the increase in our operating supplies and expenses. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter, primarily by leveraging our quality revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As we move into the second half of 2022, we have areas of opportunity to drive further improvement in our financial results. We will continue to focus on obtaining the yield increases, necessary to improve the profitability of each customer account. We will also maintain disciplined control over costs to keep our cost inflation on a per shipment basis to a minimum. Our team is now appropriately sized and most of our service centers to support our anticipated shipment trends. And as a result, we believe we should start seeing improved productivity throughout our operations. The stability of our workforce has also allowed us to reduce our utilization of third-party purchase transportation and moved closer to the fully in-sourced linehaul operation that we prefer. We believe this is one of many key factors, creating the service advantage we have in our industry, all of which comes back to helping us win long-term market share. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $427.3 million and $816.1 million for the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while capital expenditures were $229.4 million and $323.1 million for those same periods. We utilized $293.5 million and $731.9 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.8 million and $68 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter of 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about the price environment. Obviously, there are some concerns out there about \u2013 more than some concerns about moderation in demand and volumes and you've some of your rates of growth have probably slowed as well on that front. Can you maybe talk about ex-fuel sort of the core price thoughts as you move through the balance of this year? And have you had discussions with shippers, or if they come to you and started to talk about things as they approach their next contracts? Thanks.\nGreg Gantt: Yes. Jordan, so far we haven't seen much of any at all of any customers asking for cheaper rates, or any kind of exception pricing or anything such as that. I think from what we can tell the industry is extremely disciplined. I think you know over our history we've been more than extremely disciplined. And I think that will continue to be our focus. And right now that's what we're seeing throughout the industry. So I think that's good for all of us. So, we'll see but so far very, very positive from that standpoint. \nJordan Alliger: And then just a follow-up on fuel and fuel surcharges, I know the mechanisms are supposed to work as a pass through. Obviously, fuel surcharges have generally ramped up for the industry pretty quickly maybe even faster than the cost of diesel. Can you talk about the impact on P&L from the rising fuel environment? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Jordan, the way our program is designed, we really want it to be neutral to the bottom line as fuel goes up and down. And certainly as contracts come up in each period and they come up in every quarter for us. But as they come up we look at what the current fuel price environment looks like and then we try to stress test both up and down to see what that individual customer's overall revenue contributions might look like, and being the same for what their costing looks like. And so we try to do the best we can to make sure that that customer's individual account profitability understanding all the costs that go into the model for each individual customer account will come out positive, whichever way the fuel might trend. So I think that, our surcharge has certainly been effective with offsetting the increased cost of diesel fuel, and certainly that's having a direct effect on other petroleum-based products, but there's also a lot of indirect effect as well. That's why we continue to see our cost going up, and it's why we've got to continue to be disciplined with our yield management program.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Greg, there's been this thought that as trucking capacity truckload capacity starts to loosen, and especially as we've seen some major retail pre-announcements that LTL has been this massive beneficiary with the only capacity in town, can you kind of detail your book of business a little bit? And how much you would consider that's on your network today being non-traditional LTL freight? And have you seen any shift in your market share either up or down let's call it since mid-May when this whole retail fear started to really emerge?\nGreg Gantt: Yeah. Jon, I'm going to let Adam address that. But obviously, there's business that moves back and forth. And it's extremely hard to measure. But I think Adam's got a better handle on those specifics details than I do.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, Jon, just to give a little bit of detail, certainly, as those announcements came out last quarter from certain retailers, we've been addressing that question, but we've got many customers that ship and receive that are beyond those two big box retailers. But nevertheless, our book of business is still 55% to 60% industrial. And I think the industrial-related customers and when you look at certain macroeconomic factors in that industrial economy is they're continuing to expand and we probably got a little bit more growth out of our industrial-related customers in this most recent quarter than on the retail side. But our retail, which is 25% to 30% continues to perform strongly as well. It's just a little bit below the company average, but we're still seeing nice growth there. So it's something that we'll continue to work through though, and we believe we've got opportunities with each of those pieces of our business overall. We don't have a lot of truckload spillover-type business in our network. We worked incredibly hard last year, to make sure, when capacity was at a premium that we were allocating capacity more so to traditional LTL shipments and customers that were tendering those to us for the sense that whenever the truckload environment freed up a little bit that we wouldn't have this swing of freight going back into that market. And traditionally you see more of those shipments would be in our spot quote network. That used to be about 5% of our overall revenue. It's probably about 1.5% at this point. And those are shipments generally that existing customers have and that they're asking for something different from us so to speak. But we feel good about demand. We've talked about that. We've had a lot of customer engagement in recent months and we're hearing good things from our customers. They continue to demand service quality. We've worked really hard for multiple years on improving and strengthening our value proposition. And I think we're seeing that come through with the strength in customer relationships that we have right now. And so as a result we're not losing business. The volumes are a little bit flatter but I think you can just look and some of that may be demand for existing customers' products. So we feel good about everything our customers are telling us and just continuing to work and manage through to where the volumes are currently trending as we try to manage all elements of capacity within our business.\nJon Chappell: That's helpful Adam. Just for my follow-up to Greg. Obviously the economy has changed a little bit since the start of the year. You mentioned you already have -- you still have 15% to 20% spare capacity today and still have the ambitions to grow the network as you set out back in January. Have you thought at all about tempering some of that door growth in the back half of this year as the economy becomes a bit more murky, or is this really your time to shine and invest when others have to scale back and that kind of just helps with the longer term market share?\nGreg Gantt: Yeah, absolutely. It's the latter Jon for sure. Sometimes our opportunities are a little better when it slows down. And sometimes you just have better opportunities when it's like it is today. So we can't stop. I've talked about it before how difficult it is to expand your network, how long it takes, how lengthy the process is in certain locations, some certainly way worse than others. So we can't quit. We want to continue to grow that share and we know we've got to continue our efforts on a consistent basis to have that tight capacity when things get tight like they have been in the last 1.5 years two years.\nJon Chappell: Great. Thanks Greg. Thanks Adam.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So I guess maybe to, kind of, go back to the June and July commentary, could you talk about what June tons per day were on a year-over-year basis? Could you maybe give us that number? And then Adam I know we're going to wait until the Q comes out to get full details on July, but any sort of sense for -- or any commentary you can share about how July tonnage is maybe trending versus normal seasonal patterns? I think that would be helpful for folks.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. On June, our tons per day were flat basically with where we were last year. And so on a sequential basis, it was pretty flat as well. And with respect to shipments, we -- actually the shipments per day for June were -- on a year-over-year basis were down 0.7%. On a sequential basis we were up 0.6% versus May. And as it relates to July, we are trending up. Our revenue overall was up about 18%. And looking at the yield component of that, we don't like to give the full details. We used to. And if things move 10 basis points off what we had said that the story could take a different turn one way or the other. But our yield trends right now if you look at revenue per hundredweight in July it's up about 7.5% so you can kind of get into what the volume trends will look like. And to point out before anything is written about yield that's a little bit below where we were for the second quarter. But we're going to see some changes in the mix of our freight as we compare to the third quarter of last year that was the lowest point for our weight per shipment. We were seeing sequential decreases there and in the third quarter, the overall average was 1538 pounds there. So we're still trending at about 1,560 or so pounds in July. It was right at 1,570 in the second quarter. So as we start to see more of an increase in that weight per shipment. Certainly that's usually lower revenue per hundredweight. So they'll have a little bit of an effect there.\nJack Atkins: Okay. And that 7.5% is ex-fuel correct?\nAdam Satterfield: Correct. Yes.\nJack Atkins: Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then I guess for my follow-up, I guess this one's for you as well Adam. But just -- is there a way to maybe think about operating ratio trends sequentially into the third quarter? I think typically there's a little bit of degradation just seasonally 2Q to 3Q. As we've been talking about for the last two years, it doesn't feel like anything is following normal seasonal patterns anymore though. But would just be curious to get your sense for how we should be thinking about operating ratio trends sequentially if there's any puts and takes to maybe think about there?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yeah. So it's normally about a 50 basis point increase from the second to the third quarter. We've got some different things going on this year. And one thing in particular is in our general supplies and expenses. We've got some -- we don't want to necessarily say what they are at this point, but we've got some exciting new things that we're doing from a marketing standpoint where we'll see more cost in the third quarter -- the third and the fourth quarters than what we saw in the second quarter. So there's -- expecting about a 40 to 50 basis point increase in those costs, as a percent of revenue from the second to the third quarter, just mainly due to the timing of some of these programs. But -- so that would kind of take normalized up to about 100 basis points much like we talked about at the end of the first quarter call our miscellaneous expenses have been trending below what that normal average rate. That's usually about 0.5 point. So might see that revert back to average. That's kind of what I've been anticipating. So somewhere in that probably 100 to 150 basis point range I feel like it's kind of just a normalized target for us and that is off a base of 69.5% just to make sure everyone saw that.\nJack Atkins: Absolutely, we definitely saw that. Well, thanks very much for the color. I'm really appreciating it. I'll hand it over.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: I'll just kick off with that comment. Congratulations on the margins guys. That was a pretty incredible achievement. Maybe to just start off with a big picture question related to that. How do you run the business? Do you run it for top line growth, EBIT growth? Do you have a margin target? Do you have an incremental margin target? Kind of what's your north star if you will in how you run the business?\nGreg Gantt: All of the above.\nRavi Shanker: That's easy.\nAdam Satterfield: No. I mean, certainly we've got just some broad measures that we look at. For one, any dollar that we invest needs to have an appropriate return with it. But as we talk with our customers we look and we think about what our long-term market share opportunities are. And then that dictates the investments that we need to make. Certainly when you look at our strategic plan, it starts with giving good service, and to give good service that supports our yield management which then produces the cash flow that we can reinvest in capacity and to reinvest back in our employee base that's really what drives the service products. So -- but we don't want to just grow for growth's sake. We feel like we want to produce profitable growth. And that's the reason why we talk about the long-term margin improvement that we feel like we can continue to generate. We laid out an annual operating ratio goal of below 70% when we finished the fourth quarter last year and certainly doing it for one quarter shows that it can be done, but we've just got to continue to work at it. And there's nothing magic that will make that happen. It will just be continued disciplined execution of our plan, and a focus on a continuous improvement cycle that we have. And it takes every employee coming in every day, thinking about what they can do to make this company better, whether it's improving our service and revenue opportunities or trying to take cost out of the equation as well. So we want to continue to produce profitable growth. We've got a good track record of doing it. We think when we look out over the next 10 years we've got tremendous opportunity there. And that too should create increased shareholder value for us.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. And if it were easy everyone would be doing it. Maybe a second question on the macro, obviously a lot of red flags out there on inventory levels, what are your customers telling you about what their inventory levels look like? And what do you think is a potential risk to the cycle in the back half? And maybe if you can distinguish that between industrial and consumer end markets that would be helpful.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. Like what I was saying before, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers if you will. And it's really things are playing out exactly like we thought they would. For the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the fact that customers were telling us good things that supported the demand trends that we were seeing and what we were hearing from customers and that we felt like that if consumption did slow and it had the effect for slowing overall GDP, that freight demand could remain strong. And certainly we feel like that's what we're seeing and what we continue to hear from our customers. And so, we've had a lot of engagement like I mentioned with them over the last few months. And we're still hearing overall that generally inventories are lower than what they need to be. Many of our customers are still dealing with record numbers of back orders that they've got to figure out how to get labor and other -- fixing other supply chain issues to make sure they've got all the parts and pieces to produce finished product to fulfill those orders. And so, for that reason, it's something that we think freight demand can continue to remain steady and support steadying us with volumes, as we continue to move through this year. But a lot of people have just got issues they've got to continue to work through and we want to be there to continue to help them and make sure that, if it is one of our manufacturing customers, we're continuing to help them and taking supply chain issues off their platform. And if it's a product that needs to be available for sale, certainly, if you're selecting a carrier with 99% on time and claims ratio of 0.1%, we certainly are going to provide the service that our customers are demanding.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. And then, just one very last follow-up on fuel. I know you said earlier that you're looking for fuel to be net neutral to EBIT. But I think you're doing a nearly 50% incremental margin on fuel surcharge revenues. I'm just trying to better understand this. Is it just a timing thing? Is it something that's going to -- just from a modeling perspective, how do we think about fuel with the volatility here and kind of maybe moderating in the back half? And what that does to your overall incremental margins?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think, that it's -- who knows what's going to happen with the price of fuel, but we're certainly in the camp that we hope it tracks down for the overall health of the economy. And I think you've got to look back, if we get into a declining fuel rate environment, the impact that that might have when you look back in 2015-2016 was kind of the last period where we saw some pretty big decreases there in the fuel rates. And just like I mentioned before, if we get in that declining rate environment we'll be looking at contracts as they come due and looking at lower fuel surcharge contributions, but lower fuel cost as well. And I know everyone likes to try to take the fuel out of both the revenue and on the cost side, but the reality is, it's in the revenue that we're trying to collect and it's in our expenses as we pay our payables. And so, it's something that we've got to account for. And it's why when we talk about our long-term yield management philosophy, we include fuel in both the revenue per shipment and the cost per shipment. And if you look over the last 10 or 15 years, with fuel being moderately higher or moderately lower when you look on an average basis over that period, we've been able to exceed our cost per shipment inflation between 100 and 150 basis points. And so in some individual quarters that may look a little different than others, but we've got a lot of long-term customers and that's how you've got to look at things from a customer relationship standpoint is, overall, what are those inputs on the revenue and cost side and how can we continue to create some positive delta there to help us continue to reinvest in the capacity back in our business, because no one else is investing in service center capacity like we are. And that's part of the value proposition, so we can help our customers grow.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you, so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please, go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. It's Tom Wadewitz. I think, Adam, you talked about head count and you said you kind of have the resource you need and can probably be steady for a while. I think when you've added a lot of people in a short period of time, there's opportunity for them to kind of learn the system and get better at what they do. So how do you -- how should we think about the potential impact to your margin or to different cost buckets if we have kind of a stable tonnage backdrop and a stable head count framework for you the next couple of quarters? How might that productivity affect margin and which cost lines might improve?\nGreg Gantt: Yes, Tom, I'm going to try to answer that for you. But I'll say this, we've been through a tough time, not just OD, but the entire LTL industry with the growth that we've experienced in the last year-and-a-half, two years. Since the fall of 2020, it's been a handful for all of us to respond to our customer needs and people requirements, equipment and all those kind of things. We've hired an awful lot of people, somewhere in the 6,000-plus range, when you look at all -- across all employees, dock, drivers and everything else, but it's an awful lot of additional head count. And in that comes an awful lot of inexperienced folks that we've had to deal with over the last couple of years. So while I don't think anybody would say they really want things to slow down, certainly I don't. I mean, its fun when you're busy and you've got challenges, trying to accomplish all the things you want to accomplish. But at the same time when we get into these leaner times and we start to flatten out like we are now, it's not all bad. You can step back and start to refine some of your processes, you end up with certainly better trained employees and whatnot, they understand what to do, how to do it. You're not adding to the list of folks like you were back in the last couple of years. So it's not bad by any stretch. And certainly, our platform productivity, our P&D productivity, maybe some of the aspects of line haul load factor and whatnot, those are included as well, but we can improve in all of those areas. It also gives you some time to look at your clerical processes and whatnot. What's good, what's bad, is there some technology out there that can help you with those kind of things. So, there's just an awful lot of advantages to not being so crazy busy like we've been. So, definitely positive from that standpoint. Again, nobody wants to see it slow down, but certainly, we look at the positive aspect of it, and what we can accomplish while it's this way and be better when we come out of it on the other side certainly.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. And I guess the second question is really just kind of a clarification. I know you talked a bit about July. You had a couple of questions on that. Is the tonnage implied in that something around flat, or does it imply down a little bit? I know you don't want to give us the precise numbers, because it can change a bit as you have the full month. But is the backing into kind of a flattish tonnage number about right, what you've seen so far in July?\nAdam Satterfield: It's down slightly, Tom. And when we look at -- so, it down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we've seen in the prior couple of quarters, the first month of the quarter. In the first quarter this year, the second quarter as well, was well below normal seasonal trends. I would say that we're a little bit below our normal seasonality. Typically, July is always a month of decreases, typically decreases about 3%, as compared to June. We are a little bit below that. But, as some of you are looking to from a year-over-year standpoint comparing this year back to 2019, at least what we're seeing is kind of similar -- somewhat similar trend in July versus June looking at it from that perspective as well. So, we'll see how the rest of the third quarter continues to play out. Typically, September is our busiest month of the year. And so, we'll look to see volumes -- if we get some sequential acceleration to get through the remainder of this quarter, but it's just something we'll continue to stay engaged with our customers on and try to continue to manage from a cost standpoint and make sure we've got everyone and everything in place to deal with the volumes that we're seeing.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, okay. Great. Thanks, Adam. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to touch on sort of the commentary around the pace of demand and not to be too nitpicky, but I guess I just want to sort of maybe understand, it seems like tonnage is maybe performing a little bit less than typical seasonality. So I guess I'm curious, do you think there is a sort of demand deceleration that's kind of becoming more clear within the numbers? It sounds like customers are still relatively optimistic about what the pace of volume might look like as the year progresses. But is there a bit of a disconnect between what you're hearing from them and what's actually coming through from a tonnage perspective?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't know that it's -- I mean this is really something we've had to address all year and really trying to bifurcate the demand that we're seeing and hearing from our customers versus the actual tonnage trends. And we have -- like I just mentioned, we have underperformed normal seasonality. But we have to somewhat keep in mind too that our 10-year average trends that includes our market share doubling over that time period. So, we have continued to win market share. I think when you look at our numbers versus the industry, the last two or three quarters, I think if you take the public carriers the tons have been negative overall for that group while you've seen obviously tremendous growth from us. And I still think that based on the feedback and conversations with customers that you'll continue to see our volume numbers outperforming, at least that public group that we compare against. And so, the conversation around demand is the demand for our service. And certainly, our customers they may not have the same type of volumes. So, we're still picking up. We haven't lost any customer accounts. We're still making pickups every day, but it may just be. They don't have the same number of shipments to give us, because some of the demand for their product has decreased. But, I think the positive takeaway from this is how strong we continue to see one the strength of our pricing programs, but just those customer conversations and no customer defections and the conversation about the need for service and how important that is becoming to your customers. We've certainly proven our value proposition over years. And how -- we may be a little bit more expensive upfront, but when you look at the total cost of transportation, whether it's delivering and meeting the on-time and full requirements that some of the retailers have in place, we can ultimately help our customers save money. And so those are the things that continue to drive these positive customer conversations that we're having.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate that color. That makes sense. And you guys have been through obviously many cycles and so \u2013 and have been pretty successful in navigating through those cycles. You just mentioned the sort of resiliency and the pricing you're able to get in this market even as maybe demand at your customers is beginning to fall a little bit. So if we think about sort of a normal recession whatever that may be in your definition, how do you think sort of operating ratio and maybe earnings power progresses, assuming that maybe the back half or some point in 2023, we're seeing more sustained negative volumes for the industry? Is positive profit something that we can kind of continue to look for from the model? Just kind of curious, how you think about that resiliency in a downturn.\nGreg Gantt: Chris, I think all of us are going to have to see where this thing goes. I mean I don't think we're in a recession yet, at least I haven't heard that. We'll have to see where it goes. But at the same time you got to remember, we're up against some tremendous numbers from last year and we're still at a very, very decent level of business, where we can turn a pretty good profit I think. I mean we \u2013 I think we've proven that, right? And certainly the second quarter bears that out. But I think we're still in a pretty good spot. Again, we can't control the economy and some of the things that the government does that drive some of it and whatnot. But I think we're still in a good spot today and let's hope we don't see further deterioration in the things going on from an economic standpoint.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Certainly, we can see the strength of the numbers we have no doubt about that. Thanks for the comment. Appreciate it.\nGreg Gantt: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the headcount question. So if I look back at some of the past periods where tonnage has gone negative, headcount usually follows and comes down too. If I just take flat headcount from here in Q3, it's still up about 10%. Do you see opportunities if tonnage stays negative to reduce headcount, or are you going to be potentially more reluctant to do that this time around just given the problems that everybody had hiring people?\nGreg Gantt: I think maybe you're pretty perceptive of how our industry has been the last couple of years with that question, Scott. No question. I mean we certainly don't want to get in a situation where we have to start making cuts and that kind of thing. That's extremely hard to do. We always hate to do that. I mean obviously, we've got to try to match revenue or the shipment levels to labor. I mean that's what we've done for many, many years and we have to continue to do that. In some cases, attrition helps to take care of our situation. So we always have a little bit of that, probably much less here than most places. But we \u2013 obviously, we're stalling hiring. We're not actively hiring hardly anywhere now maybe specific needs and replacements and that kind of thing but we're certainly not adding anybody on top of what we've got. So yes, I can promise you any reductions we would make we would look at those very, very carefully before we execute it if that makes sense.\nScott Group: Okay. But it does sound like if we're not sort of hiring more will there be some sort of natural attrition that could take the headcount down a little bit from here?\nGreg Gantt: Certainly. Absolutely. \nScott Group: Okay. And so maybe just to tie that with that last question. So in an environment, where tonnage stays negative for a little bit, do you think you could still improve the operating ratio or maintain the operating ratio as you've done in like 15 out of 16 years or something like that?\nGreg Gantt: Well, that would obviously, would be our objective to continue to maintain and certainly improve. I think we've proven it over the course of time and we'll just have to wait and see. I don't want to get into all of that at this point in time. My crystal ball is not completely crystal clear. So we'll just have to see where it goes, but we'll certainly continue to do the right things day-to-day. We'll continue to execute from a service standpoint and what not, keep our people focused on doing the right things and those are the things that drive the bottom line, sometimes the top and the bottom line. But we'll continue to do those things well and we'll see where it goes.\nScott Group: Thank you for the time, guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTodd Fowler: Hey, great. Thanks and good morning. So Adam in your prepared comments, you had some commentary about cost inflation to the back half of the year. And I'm guessing or I think that traditionally you put through an employee wage increase at some point in the third quarter. And it sounds like you're also getting some benefit from improving productivity from the workforce standpoint. So I guess my question is are your comments that waging that cost inflation on a per shipment basis, is that going to increase or accelerate in the back half of the year, or does that start to level off? I guess, I'm just kind of curious, what your expectations are on the cost inflation side moving forward. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We do always give a wage increase at the beginning of September each year. And so that's pretty standard in terms of, it's in our numbers and it's part of the reason, why the third quarter operating ratio is generally higher, than the second. But from an overall inflation standpoint, when we started the year, we expected higher inflation in the first half. And really, we started seeing cost increasing about this point in time last year. And so our costs are going up, and that's when you can really start seeing -- when we looked at contracts that were turning over in those periods, we had to get larger increases then. So we felt like we were going to see some moderation, with our cost in the back half of this year. But certainly, did perceive the sustained increase in fuel prices and NIM continue to accelerate like they have this year, and that's having a follow-on effect both directly and indirectly with other pieces of our cost structure. So at this point, I don't expect to see that moderation, like we had initially talked about. But don't necessarily see it, accelerating either from this point. I just think that we're going to continue to see, maybe that core inflation number kind of in that 7% to 9% range like we have. And when you back -- if you take our -- look at our costs, and back the operating supplies and expenses out, which includes fuel, they were up about 10% on a in the second quarter, on a per shipment basis. And so it's certainly -- that's higher than where we thought it would be. And -- but we do have some opportunities like Greg mentioned, we certainly want to continue to focus on improving the productivity of all areas of our operation. I think that can help some of that that cost per shipment inflation. We were able to reduce our purchase transportation in the second quarter. There's still a little bit of miles, that we were outsourcing in the second quarter. So we're back in that 2% to 2.5% range number, with that line item, but there may be a little bit more out of that number where we can see some decreases. But otherwise, it's just trying to manage each and every line item on the income statement that we can and look for areas, with discretionary spending that we can pull back on and just look for any area that we can ultimately save some dollars.\nTodd Fowler: Perfect. Okay, good. That's helpful, and that makes a lot of sense. I guess just to follow up, and it's a little bit of a tricky question to ask, but from a bigger picture standpoint, it sounds like a lot of your competitors their approach to the LTL market now is a lot more like your approach adding some more terminals, focusing more on service. I guess, as you think about the competitive landscape, does that change your ability to win share in the marketplace going forward, or have you seen any differences in customer responses, due to some of the things that your competitors have been doing over the last, let's call it four to six quarters? \nGreg Gantt: I don't think so, Todd. I mean, we'll continue to execute and do the things that we know best, how to do. I think we've had a pretty steady run up, on our share and I would expect that to continue. \nTodd Fowler: Yes. That makes sense. I know it\u2019s a tricky question to ask but was just curious about time itself. Thanks for the time this morning. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nKen Hoexter: Great. Good morning. Greg and Adam, congrats on breaking 70% a tremendous group leadership there. Just a few -- I guess, you had a few questions on the downturn or potential impacts on the operating ratio. But maybe just, if July is starting to see larger negative tonnage trends versus June and maybe a little bit more than seasonality. Can you talk about a normal cycle? How does that bleed into pricing pressure? I know you don't typically change your pricing, given the quality of service but for the group, how long does it take to see those negative trends kick in and start showing up on the pricing side especially, given what's happened with the truckload side? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Again, I think that when you look at the rest of the group excluding us, I think overall, there's been at least the past three quarters or so where volumes have been negative and -- or at least flat and going back to last year. And so it's -- the environment has continued to -- the pricing environment that is, has continued to remain positive and we haven't heard anything any different really in that regard. So, I think that we know what our strategies are and what we're going to continue to do, a big piece of our yield management strategy is making sure that we're trying to cover the cost inflation we see in our business, but an even bigger element is making sure that we're generating the returns, that will help us continue to invest dollars in the real estate network. And I think when you look over the last 10 years, we've invested about $2 billion in expanding the capacity of our network and when you look at the expansion of our door capacity is about a little over 50% over that 10-year timeframe and at least the number of service centers in the industry is actually down a few percent.  So regardless, if you see some additions here and there, we have been adding really at our customers' requests and our customers are leveraging our network especially in the retail side, some of this e-commerce freight comes and transitions from the truckload world into LTL, that's the power of our network. It helps our customers with managing their supply chains. And ultimately, we think helping them save money overall. So that's why we've got to continue to work at it, but it's still an environment where we've got positive revenue growth.  And our revenue growth of 18% includes that slight decrease in July for tons that we're seeing, but we're still producing revenue growth that's above our long-term average revenue growth rate when you look over the last 10 years. And so, we're just going to continue to look at leveraging that to the bottom line. And certainly, kind of what we talked about with the operating ratio, moving into the third quarter that would still produce some pretty good improvement there on the next quarter's a lot.\nKen Hoexter: Adam, just to clarify that. You talked about the last couple of quarters seeing the industry in the past has -- have you seen a more immediate impact to industry pricing or even your pricing in a down tonnage environment, or does it take about three quarters or whatever to start seeing some pressure on? I'm just trying to see if this time really is different because of the industry moves or if this is more historically normal on a delayed pricing impact? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think if you look back 2019 is a good example where the environment was softer. And I think the industry was pretty disciplined with pricing during that period. So, we certainly expect that our own pricing will continue to be positive. And again, we haven't really heard anything from any other carriers. We'll continue to see maybe what they're saying publicly as well. But I think it takes a lot to run an LTL company. Certainly, there's a network effect that has to be managed there. And that's the big difference between us and the truckload environment. I think that it seems to us from what we've heard that, there's not many LTL carriers at least the public ones that have taken on a lot of truckload spillover freight. So, I don't think you're going to see this vacuum effect as truckload has loosened a little bit of freight spilling back into that mode like, we may have seen in prior cycles as well either. So, to me that would lend itself to seeing a little bit more stability maybe with volumes even though like I mentioned they're down for the other carriers or have been for the last few quarters. We'll continue to watch that. But I think we would expect to see the continuation of a disciplined approach much like we did in 2019.\nKen Hoexter: And can I just get a clarification on one of the prior questions on -- you talked about stalling hiring now. If we see, I guess those volumes staying at these levels is that something you then expect the attrition to overtake your hiring? And so, you expect that to come in? I just wanted to clarify kind of your comments on the employee levels?\nAdam Satterfield: Well hiring practices that's something that each one of our 255 service center managers are responsible for. They have to stay engaged with their customers at the local level to know what freight demand within their facility is going to look like to then make sure that they've got the right people capacity in place to be able to respond and give the service that our customers demand from us.  So that's something that we let them manage. It's not just the number of people they have in place. There's always managing the hours worked up and down based on changes with the volumes as well. So, we just got to continue to watch overall how the volumes trend and we feel good about our numbers right now and we feel good about our overall level of headcount as well. But ultimately, we'll continue to let our service centers manage that and individually maybe see seeing some that are making additions because they're growing and we're seeing in some facilities really strong double-digit outbound type of revenue and volume growth. And then the others, if they've got some weakness in their facility for whatever reason specific customer type of issues they -- they've got to manage on the other side. But it's a coordinated effort that's really -- we give that responsibility with oversight obviously. But our service center managers are handling that on a day-to-day basis. \nKen Hoexter: Wonderful. Thanks very much, Adam, Greg. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nAmit Mehrotra: Hey, thanks. I'll try to just ask one question to balance out the three questions that some other people asked. I think three or four years ago, Greg and Adam you kind of started the call mentioning, some deteriorating pricing power in the industry. And on follow-up you kind of talked about just bringing attention to some indiscipline that you're seeing in certain lanes. I think part of the motivation was to kind of nip it in the bud early. It seems like we're kind of at that part of the cycle where we could start to see that a little bit. I'd love for you guys to comment on that. Are you seeing any players any large national players, because of weaker service levels or whatever that may be seeing a little bit more deterioration and demand start to be a little bit more indisciplined on pricing? If you can comment on that.\nGreg Gantt : No. We have not seen that at all. Certainly not to my knowledge I haven't heard that. Like Adam had mentioned earlier, we've had an awful lot of customer interaction so far this year with customers coming here, some of the things we're doing out in the field from a customer standpoint, we have not seen that have not gotten that type of feedback from our sales department. So I think that's all positive. And I think if you look at our LTL industry, we're all healthier than we've been for the most part. I think the bottom lines have improved across the board. I think I can say that without putting a whole lot of thought into it, but I think everybody has to see the benefit of being price disciplined surely. So I think it's benefited the industry in general. So, yes, let's hope that continues.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. That's my one. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Great. Thanks for the time here. Greg, I just want to follow-up on those pricing comments really quick. We've heard from a few others out there that there's been a little bit of a pickup in inbound RFPs and RFQs maybe especially from the larger national account side. Are you all seeing any signs of that?\nGreg Gantt : I don't think so. I haven't heard that. I mean, most of our bigger national accounts they're all -- we have annual renewals and whatnot. Some may be on two or three-year type renewals. But -- most everybody that's on annual renewal I haven't heard that there's any huge pickup with that at all. So, no at this point not, but we'll see certainly have to wait and see, but so far so good from our standpoint.\nBruce Chan: Okay. Great. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAri Rosa: Hey, good morning. Greg, Adam. Thanks for squeezing me in here. So you guys talked about investing in the network to take share through the cycle or preparing for the next cycle. And it's certainly a formula that's worked very well for OD in the past. I wanted to get your sense for kind of how you're thinking about that in terms of the longevity of what a down cycle might look like, and kind of the risk that you might be sitting on idle capacity for an extended period of time, if demand deteriorates. And it seems like there's kind of two different schools of thought. On one level, it seems like the LTL industry has been pretty tight on capacity and pretty disciplined about the way it's invested. And maybe that means there hasn't been as much froth that's developed on the supply side. At the same time, obviously, what we've seen in terms of consumer spending and durable goods orders has been pretty anomalous over the last kind of 18 to 24 months given COVID, and maybe there's some concern that that those conditions that have existed over the past 18 months or so aren't really sustainable from a demand perspective. So I just wanted to kind of hear your thoughts on, as you invest to expand the service center footprint, how do you perceive the risk that you might be sitting on idle capacity for maybe a longer period of time than you might hope for?\nAdam Satterfield : Yes. I think we're always sitting on idle capacity and that's really what we want to have in place. And we generally target having 20% to 25% excess capacity at all times. And the reason for that is as quickly as demand can change, you can't put service center capacity in place quick enough. And it takes doors in an LTL network to really process freight and be able to grow. Certainly, you got to have equipment and people as well, but the doors are really what takes the most time to get in place. And it's why when we see these positive inflections in the domestic economy that you see the rate of market share growth for us increased significantly where we're outperforming the rest of the group by double digits if you will. And so it's -- you've got to put in place, you got to have a consistent investment process and just continuing to work at it knowing where things are tighter and where you might be tight in a couple of years' time if volume comes back to you in a big way. So we're used to carrying that extra cost, but that's part of our strategy and it is different. We like to keep that excess capacity in place. Most of the industry it seems operates closer to full utilization within the network and -- but that creates a lot of volume opportunities like we saw in 2020 in the back half as the recovery began and certainly through 2021 with the rate of growth that we had then and so far through the first half of this year. And again, as we said earlier, we've produced over $700 million of revenue growth. So last year was a record at $1.2 billion for us and we're on a good pace to have another $1 billion plus type of revenue growth year, but it certainly takes making those investments. And when you look and trying to go back into some of these prior years when there has been a down cycle. You can look at our operating ratio in 2016-2019 we're able to manage all of our variable costs well and try to take advantage of productivity opportunities. But generally the only change in the operating ratio you might see is with respect to that depreciation line item and that's where we are making those investments those depreciation cost will increase as a percent of revenue. But we try to manage all of the other costs flat or with some improvement if we can to minimize any type of negative impact on the operating ratio until we get that volume flow coming through again. And we've said it takes density and yields to produce long-term margin improvement and that will continue into the future as well. But certainly need to get that density factor it takes a continuous investment in capacity. \nAri Rosa: Got it. Understood. Okay. Thank you for the time.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Adam in the last six months you guys have bought considerably more stock than you bought in any prior full year. Can you talk a little bit about the pace you feel comfortable with in the second half? And will you consider adding a little leverage to take advantage of the share price, or historically you've been -- within your free cash flow as far as total shareholder returns is that a good kind of bookend to think about as we think about where share repurchase can go? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, certainly the repurchase program we typically look at our cash from operations. And at the beginning of every year we know what our CapEx is going to be. And then we've got the fixed return element through the dividend program and then we typically take the balance and try to put that into the share repurchase program. But we have said in prior periods when we think the opportunity is right, we'll put more dollars into that program. And certainly that's how we have felt this year. In the first quarter, we did have a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program. In the second quarter it was more strategic and just day-to-day buying on a more of a 10b-5 type of basis. And we'll continue to look at all options as we move forward. But certainly, when the share price is at the level where it's been, it's certainly down from where we finished last year and we're going to continue to buy more shares and use the cash that's on the balance sheet for starters and you just got to continue to look at it on a day-to-day basis. We've -- in the past we've said we don't necessarily want to directly borrow to go out to buy stock. But we've always just got to look at kind of where the price is trending and what we think the best use of cash is and then just trying to take a longer-term view of it as well. \nBascome Majors: Great. So it sounds like leverage to buy stock is not plan A but opportunism can make that possible depending on your view of the market versus your stock price? \nAdam Satterfield: Correct. \nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nJames Monigan: Hey, guys. Thank you. Just wanted to actually touch on -- or follow-up on something you had mentioned around the spread between pricing cost and just the pricing environment overall. I just wanted to sort of get your sense on sort of the amount of cost pressure maybe some of your competitors are under and if you think that might keep discipline fairly high around pricing? And also just maybe sort of thinking about like the outlook for that spread moving forward just given the fact that you guys own more of your assets and therefore might have a cost advantage? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I don't know that we can comment on our competitors' cost structures, but certainly for us we obviously feel like we've got opportunity to continue to one to try to reduce some of our costs through productivity. But that's again, kind of, going back to our continuous improvement cycle and then trying to price above cost. And it's not always on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Again, it's not always going to be that we've got that 100 basis point to 150 basis point delta in our revenue per shipment and cost per shipment performance, and you've got to look at that on a more of a core basis. But we just look at it over a longer-term time horizon. But that's the yield improvements, one big element for the long-term margin improvement opportunities that we think we have. And I mean obviously a lot goes into that. It's easy to sit here and say that we need yield above cost, but a lot go into both of those metrics. And certainly you got to have a service to support the yield. And then we've got to continue to look at ways that we can save on the cost side as well to make sure that our price deal in alignment with the market. And we do believe we can get a price premium in the market based on the quality of our service and we study our Mastio Quality results closely each year to look at how we compare against ourselves and how we compare against the rest of the industry to make sure that we're staying on top of changes. We're staying ahead of the market. We're continuing to give our customers what they are asking for as well, be it through capacity in markets, be it capacity of our trailer pool, technologies, pricing programs, and new changes there. You name it, we're always trying to stay ahead of the curve and we feel confident that we've got a lot of market share opportunities in front of us and we just want to keep our focus on execution to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities and again make sure that it's not just growth it's good profitable growth. \nJames Monigan: Got it. Just given how much cost run up do you think that there's a repricing opportunity or a need to reprice moving forward on a larger portion of your business than normal?\nAdam Satterfield: No. And again that's part of our continuous improvement cycle. Our contracts in our business come up every day. It's why you generally see on a sequential basis improvements in our yield metrics as we go from quarter-to-quarter. So, as a contract comes up for renewal, we're going to ask for an increase. And to improve the yield on an account, it's not always through a price increase either. It's looking at other areas of opportunity in ways that we can help a customer save money and that may be an operational change. It could be a number of things and that's why it's so important for our sales team to stay engaged with the customers to understand what their needs are. Our pricing team as well, so that we can work together and create win-win situations because we're not here to just have a customer for this quarter and the next quarter. We've got customers that have been in place for many, many years. And any new customer that's coming on board, we want them to be in place for the long-term as well. So, it's all about creating those win-win situations. And whether it's again through an operational change, we've recently announced a new pricing program as well that we've got some engagement on and some excitement that can eliminate the need to have payment all the services for customers. And so those are the ways that we're going to continue to stay engaged with our customer base and try to do right things right by them and keep improving our sales both the top and the bottom-lines.\nJames Monigan: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg Gantt for any closing remarks. \nGreg Gantt: Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am pleased to report that the OD team delivered strong profitable growth during the second quarter, which resulted in new company records for revenue and profitability. Our revenue increased 26.4% to $1.7 billion, while earnings per diluted share increased 42.9% to $3.30. We also improved our operating ratio by 280 basis points to 69.5%. This is the first time in our company's history that we have produced a sub-70% quarterly operating ratio. We achieved these results by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan, which has guided us for many years and throughout many economic cycles. The disciplined execution of the business fundamentals that form this plan have supported our ability to double our market share over the past 10 years. We are confident that continued execution on this plan positions us to win additional market share over the next 10 years. The foundation for our ability to win market share is our relentless focus on providing superior service at a fair price. Our on-time service performance was 99% in the second quarter, while our cargo claims ratio improved to 0.1%. These service metrics reflect the efforts of our OD family of employees who maintain a steadfast commitment to delivering value to our customers each and every day. It appears that service quality is becoming even more important to customers when selecting a carrier which is why demand for our service has remained strong. This is a trend that began to develop with the economic recovery during the second half of 2020 and it continues today as many shippers are still struggling with supply chain issues. As a result, we believe our customer relationships have strengthened as we do our part to help our manufacturing customers keep their facilities running smoothly, while helping our retail customers keep products on the shelf and available for sale. Our value proposition also includes having sufficient capacity to support our customers when they need it the most. We currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity within our service center network and we expect to open multiple new facilities during the second half of this year. These new facilities as well as various other expansion projects that we expect to complete should increase the amount of our excess capacity towards our longer term target of 25%. We remain committed to the ongoing expansion of our service center network, which we believe is important, regardless of the short-term macroeconomic outlook. Expanding service center capacity can take a significant amount of time, which is why we have historically been proactive with respect to our expansion efforts. This unique strategy has created a capacity advantage for us in the marketplace, which becomes more apparent to shippers in tight environments, like we have seen in the past couple of years. With over $700 million of year-to-date revenue growth through June, we are on pace to exceed $1 billion of revenue growth for the second year in a row. We simply could not have achieved these types of numbers without the consistent investment in our service center capacity, as well as the continued investment in our fleet, technology and the training and education of our OD family of employees. Our team has shown tremendous flexibility over the past couple of years in response to significant changes in our business levels. And I am confident that this team will continue to build on its success. We have created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry, by executing on our long-term strategic plan, by providing superior service at a fair price and having the capacity to stay ahead of our growth curve, we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth, while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Yes. Jordan, so far we haven't seen much of any at all of any customers asking for cheaper rates, or any kind of exception pricing or anything such as that. I think from what we can tell the industry is extremely disciplined. I think you know over our history we've been more than extremely disciplined. And I think that will continue to be our focus. And right now that's what we're seeing throughout the industry. So I think that's good for all of us. So, we'll see but so far very, very positive from that standpoint. Yeah. Jon, I'm going to let Adam address that. But obviously, there's business that moves back and forth. And it's extremely hard to measure. But I think Adam's got a better handle on those specifics details than I do. Yeah, absolutely. It's the latter Jon for sure. Sometimes our opportunities are a little better when it slows down. And sometimes you just have better opportunities when it's like it is today. So we can't stop. I've talked about it before how difficult it is to expand your network, how long it takes, how lengthy the process is in certain locations, some certainly way worse than others. So we can't quit. We want to continue to grow that share and we know we've got to continue our efforts on a consistent basis to have that tight capacity when things get tight like they have been in the last 1.5 years two years. All of the above. Yes, Tom, I'm going to try to answer that for you. But I'll say this, we've been through a tough time, not just OD, but the entire LTL industry with the growth that we've experienced in the last year-and-a-half, two years. Since the fall of 2020, it's been a handful for all of us to respond to our customer needs and people requirements, equipment and all those kind of things. We've hired an awful lot of people, somewhere in the 6,000-plus range, when you look at all -- across all employees, dock, drivers and everything else, but it's an awful lot of additional head count. And in that comes an awful lot of inexperienced folks that we've had to deal with over the last couple of years. So while I don't think anybody would say they really want things to slow down, certainly I don't. I mean, its fun when you're busy and you've got challenges, trying to accomplish all the things you want to accomplish. But at the same time when we get into these leaner times and we start to flatten out like we are now, it's not all bad. You can step back and start to refine some of your processes, you end up with certainly better trained employees and whatnot, they understand what to do, how to do it. You're not adding to the list of folks like you were back in the last couple of years. So it's not bad by any stretch. And certainly, our platform productivity, our P&D productivity, maybe some of the aspects of line haul load factor and whatnot, those are included as well, but we can improve in all of those areas. It also gives you some time to look at your clerical processes and whatnot. What's good, what's bad, is there some technology out there that can help you with those kind of things. So, there's just an awful lot of advantages to not being so crazy busy like we've been. So, definitely positive from that standpoint. Again, nobody wants to see it slow down, but certainly, we look at the positive aspect of it, and what we can accomplish while it's this way and be better when we come out of it on the other side certainly. Chris, I think all of us are going to have to see where this thing goes. I mean I don't think we're in a recession yet, at least I haven't heard that. We'll have to see where it goes. But at the same time you got to remember, we're up against some tremendous numbers from last year and we're still at a very, very decent level of business, where we can turn a pretty good profit I think. I mean we \u2013 I think we've proven that, right? And certainly the second quarter bears that out. But I think we're still in a pretty good spot. Again, we can't control the economy and some of the things that the government does that drive some of it and whatnot. But I think we're still in a good spot today and let's hope we don't see further deterioration in the things going on from an economic standpoint. Sure. I think maybe you're pretty perceptive of how our industry has been the last couple of years with that question, Scott. No question. I mean we certainly don't want to get in a situation where we have to start making cuts and that kind of thing. That's extremely hard to do. We always hate to do that. I mean obviously, we've got to try to match revenue or the shipment levels to labor. I mean that's what we've done for many, many years and we have to continue to do that. In some cases, attrition helps to take care of our situation. So we always have a little bit of that, probably much less here than most places. But we \u2013 obviously, we're stalling hiring. We're not actively hiring hardly anywhere now maybe specific needs and replacements and that kind of thing but we're certainly not adding anybody on top of what we've got. So yes, I can promise you any reductions we would make we would look at those very, very carefully before we execute it if that makes sense. Certainly. Absolutely. Well, that would obviously, would be our objective to continue to maintain and certainly improve. I think we've proven it over the course of time and we'll just have to wait and see. I don't want to get into all of that at this point in time. My crystal ball is not completely crystal clear. So we'll just have to see where it goes, but we'll certainly continue to do the right things day-to-day. We'll continue to execute from a service standpoint and what not, keep our people focused on doing the right things and those are the things that drive the bottom line, sometimes the top and the bottom line. But we'll continue to do those things well and we'll see where it goes. I don't think so, Todd. I mean, we'll continue to execute and do the things that we know best, how to do. I think we've had a pretty steady run up, on our share and I would expect that to continue. No. We have not seen that at all. Certainly not to my knowledge I haven't heard that. Like Adam had mentioned earlier, we've had an awful lot of customer interaction so far this year with customers coming here, some of the things we're doing out in the field from a customer standpoint, we have not seen that have not gotten that type of feedback from our sales department. So I think that's all positive. And I think if you look at our LTL industry, we're all healthier than we've been for the most part. I think the bottom lines have improved across the board. I think I can say that without putting a whole lot of thought into it, but I think everybody has to see the benefit of being price disciplined surely. So I think it's benefited the industry in general. So, yes, let's hope that continues. I don't think so. I haven't heard that. I mean, most of our bigger national accounts they're all -- we have annual renewals and whatnot. Some may be on two or three-year type renewals. But -- most everybody that's on annual renewal I haven't heard that there's any huge pickup with that at all. So, no at this point not, but we'll see certainly have to wait and see, but so far so good from our standpoint. Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks and I hope you have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue growth of 26.4% in the second quarter was driven by the 22.6% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and 2.8% increase in LTL tons per day. Demand for our superior service remained strong during the quarter, which helped support the steady trend with our volumes and consistent yield improvements. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter increased 11.4%, when compared to the first quarter of 2022, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.7% and LTL shipments per day increasing 1.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 7.4% in tons per day and an increase of 7.8% in shipments per day. At this point in July, our revenue per day has increased by approximately 18%, when compared to July 2021, which continues to exceed our long-term average growth rate. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue-related details for July in our second quarter Form 10-Q. Our second quarter operating ratio improved to 69.5%, with improvements in both our direct operating cost and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in salaries, wages and benefits, as well as purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue, effectively offset the increase in our operating supplies and expenses. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products. We improved our overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the second quarter, primarily by leveraging our quality revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As we move into the second half of 2022, we have areas of opportunity to drive further improvement in our financial results. We will continue to focus on obtaining the yield increases, necessary to improve the profitability of each customer account. We will also maintain disciplined control over costs to keep our cost inflation on a per shipment basis to a minimum. Our team is now appropriately sized and most of our service centers to support our anticipated shipment trends. And as a result, we believe we should start seeing improved productivity throughout our operations. The stability of our workforce has also allowed us to reduce our utilization of third-party purchase transportation and moved closer to the fully in-sourced linehaul operation that we prefer. We believe this is one of many key factors, creating the service advantage we have in our industry, all of which comes back to helping us win long-term market share. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $427.3 million and $816.1 million for the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while capital expenditures were $229.4 million and $323.1 million for those same periods. We utilized $293.5 million and $731.9 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2022 respectively, while cash dividends totaled $33.8 million and $68 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the second quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the third quarter of 2022. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Jordan, the way our program is designed, we really want it to be neutral to the bottom line as fuel goes up and down. And certainly as contracts come up in each period and they come up in every quarter for us. But as they come up we look at what the current fuel price environment looks like and then we try to stress test both up and down to see what that individual customer's overall revenue contributions might look like, and being the same for what their costing looks like. And so we try to do the best we can to make sure that that customer's individual account profitability understanding all the costs that go into the model for each individual customer account will come out positive, whichever way the fuel might trend. So I think that, our surcharge has certainly been effective with offsetting the increased cost of diesel fuel, and certainly that's having a direct effect on other petroleum-based products, but there's also a lot of indirect effect as well. That's why we continue to see our cost going up, and it's why we've got to continue to be disciplined with our yield management program. Yes, Jon, just to give a little bit of detail, certainly, as those announcements came out last quarter from certain retailers, we've been addressing that question, but we've got many customers that ship and receive that are beyond those two big box retailers. But nevertheless, our book of business is still 55% to 60% industrial. And I think the industrial-related customers and when you look at certain macroeconomic factors in that industrial economy is they're continuing to expand and we probably got a little bit more growth out of our industrial-related customers in this most recent quarter than on the retail side. But our retail, which is 25% to 30% continues to perform strongly as well. It's just a little bit below the company average, but we're still seeing nice growth there. So it's something that we'll continue to work through though, and we believe we've got opportunities with each of those pieces of our business overall. We don't have a lot of truckload spillover-type business in our network. We worked incredibly hard last year, to make sure, when capacity was at a premium that we were allocating capacity more so to traditional LTL shipments and customers that were tendering those to us for the sense that whenever the truckload environment freed up a little bit that we wouldn't have this swing of freight going back into that market. And traditionally you see more of those shipments would be in our spot quote network. That used to be about 5% of our overall revenue. It's probably about 1.5% at this point. And those are shipments generally that existing customers have and that they're asking for something different from us so to speak. But we feel good about demand. We've talked about that. We've had a lot of customer engagement in recent months and we're hearing good things from our customers. They continue to demand service quality. We've worked really hard for multiple years on improving and strengthening our value proposition. And I think we're seeing that come through with the strength in customer relationships that we have right now. And so as a result we're not losing business. The volumes are a little bit flatter but I think you can just look and some of that may be demand for existing customers' products. So we feel good about everything our customers are telling us and just continuing to work and manage through to where the volumes are currently trending as we try to manage all elements of capacity within our business. Sure. On June, our tons per day were flat basically with where we were last year. And so on a sequential basis, it was pretty flat as well. And with respect to shipments, we -- actually the shipments per day for June were -- on a year-over-year basis were down 0.7%. On a sequential basis we were up 0.6% versus May. And as it relates to July, we are trending up. Our revenue overall was up about 18%. And looking at the yield component of that, we don't like to give the full details. We used to. And if things move 10 basis points off what we had said that the story could take a different turn one way or the other. But our yield trends right now if you look at revenue per hundredweight in July it's up about 7.5% so you can kind of get into what the volume trends will look like. And to point out before anything is written about yield that's a little bit below where we were for the second quarter. But we're going to see some changes in the mix of our freight as we compare to the third quarter of last year that was the lowest point for our weight per shipment. We were seeing sequential decreases there and in the third quarter, the overall average was 1538 pounds there. So we're still trending at about 1,560 or so pounds in July. It was right at 1,570 in the second quarter. So as we start to see more of an increase in that weight per shipment. Certainly that's usually lower revenue per hundredweight. So they'll have a little bit of an effect there. Correct. Yes. Sure. Yeah. So it's normally about a 50 basis point increase from the second to the third quarter. We've got some different things going on this year. And one thing in particular is in our general supplies and expenses. We've got some -- we don't want to necessarily say what they are at this point, but we've got some exciting new things that we're doing from a marketing standpoint where we'll see more cost in the third quarter -- the third and the fourth quarters than what we saw in the second quarter. So there's -- expecting about a 40 to 50 basis point increase in those costs, as a percent of revenue from the second to the third quarter, just mainly due to the timing of some of these programs. But -- so that would kind of take normalized up to about 100 basis points much like we talked about at the end of the first quarter call our miscellaneous expenses have been trending below what that normal average rate. That's usually about 0.5 point. So might see that revert back to average. That's kind of what I've been anticipating. So somewhere in that probably 100 to 150 basis point range I feel like it's kind of just a normalized target for us and that is off a base of 69.5% just to make sure everyone saw that. No. I mean, certainly we've got just some broad measures that we look at. For one, any dollar that we invest needs to have an appropriate return with it. But as we talk with our customers we look and we think about what our long-term market share opportunities are. And then that dictates the investments that we need to make. Certainly when you look at our strategic plan, it starts with giving good service, and to give good service that supports our yield management which then produces the cash flow that we can reinvest in capacity and to reinvest back in our employee base that's really what drives the service products. So -- but we don't want to just grow for growth's sake. We feel like we want to produce profitable growth. And that's the reason why we talk about the long-term margin improvement that we feel like we can continue to generate. We laid out an annual operating ratio goal of below 70% when we finished the fourth quarter last year and certainly doing it for one quarter shows that it can be done, but we've just got to continue to work at it. And there's nothing magic that will make that happen. It will just be continued disciplined execution of our plan, and a focus on a continuous improvement cycle that we have. And it takes every employee coming in every day, thinking about what they can do to make this company better, whether it's improving our service and revenue opportunities or trying to take cost out of the equation as well. So we want to continue to produce profitable growth. We've got a good track record of doing it. We think when we look out over the next 10 years we've got tremendous opportunity there. And that too should create increased shareholder value for us. Yeah. Like what I was saying before, we feel good about what we're hearing from our customers if you will. And it's really things are playing out exactly like we thought they would. For the last couple of quarters, we've talked about the fact that customers were telling us good things that supported the demand trends that we were seeing and what we were hearing from customers and that we felt like that if consumption did slow and it had the effect for slowing overall GDP, that freight demand could remain strong. And certainly we feel like that's what we're seeing and what we continue to hear from our customers. And so, we've had a lot of engagement like I mentioned with them over the last few months. And we're still hearing overall that generally inventories are lower than what they need to be. Many of our customers are still dealing with record numbers of back orders that they've got to figure out how to get labor and other -- fixing other supply chain issues to make sure they've got all the parts and pieces to produce finished product to fulfill those orders. And so, for that reason, it's something that we think freight demand can continue to remain steady and support steadying us with volumes, as we continue to move through this year. But a lot of people have just got issues they've got to continue to work through and we want to be there to continue to help them and make sure that, if it is one of our manufacturing customers, we're continuing to help them and taking supply chain issues off their platform. And if it's a product that needs to be available for sale, certainly, if you're selecting a carrier with 99% on time and claims ratio of 0.1%, we certainly are going to provide the service that our customers are demanding. Well, I think, that it's -- who knows what's going to happen with the price of fuel, but we're certainly in the camp that we hope it tracks down for the overall health of the economy. And I think you've got to look back, if we get into a declining fuel rate environment, the impact that that might have when you look back in 2015-2016 was kind of the last period where we saw some pretty big decreases there in the fuel rates. And just like I mentioned before, if we get in that declining rate environment we'll be looking at contracts as they come due and looking at lower fuel surcharge contributions, but lower fuel cost as well. And I know everyone likes to try to take the fuel out of both the revenue and on the cost side, but the reality is, it's in the revenue that we're trying to collect and it's in our expenses as we pay our payables. And so, it's something that we've got to account for. And it's why when we talk about our long-term yield management philosophy, we include fuel in both the revenue per shipment and the cost per shipment. And if you look over the last 10 or 15 years, with fuel being moderately higher or moderately lower when you look on an average basis over that period, we've been able to exceed our cost per shipment inflation between 100 and 150 basis points. And so in some individual quarters that may look a little different than others, but we've got a lot of long-term customers and that's how you've got to look at things from a customer relationship standpoint is, overall, what are those inputs on the revenue and cost side and how can we continue to create some positive delta there to help us continue to reinvest in the capacity back in our business, because no one else is investing in service center capacity like we are. And that's part of the value proposition, so we can help our customers grow. It's down slightly, Tom. And when we look at -- so, it down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Similar to what we've seen in the prior couple of quarters, the first month of the quarter. In the first quarter this year, the second quarter as well, was well below normal seasonal trends. I would say that we're a little bit below our normal seasonality. Typically, July is always a month of decreases, typically decreases about 3%, as compared to June. We are a little bit below that. But, as some of you are looking to from a year-over-year standpoint comparing this year back to 2019, at least what we're seeing is kind of similar -- somewhat similar trend in July versus June looking at it from that perspective as well. So, we'll see how the rest of the third quarter continues to play out. Typically, September is our busiest month of the year. And so, we'll look to see volumes -- if we get some sequential acceleration to get through the remainder of this quarter, but it's just something we'll continue to stay engaged with our customers on and try to continue to manage from a cost standpoint and make sure we've got everyone and everything in place to deal with the volumes that we're seeing. I don't know that it's -- I mean this is really something we've had to address all year and really trying to bifurcate the demand that we're seeing and hearing from our customers versus the actual tonnage trends. And we have -- like I just mentioned, we have underperformed normal seasonality. But we have to somewhat keep in mind too that our 10-year average trends that includes our market share doubling over that time period. So, we have continued to win market share. I think when you look at our numbers versus the industry, the last two or three quarters, I think if you take the public carriers the tons have been negative overall for that group while you've seen obviously tremendous growth from us. And I still think that based on the feedback and conversations with customers that you'll continue to see our volume numbers outperforming, at least that public group that we compare against. And so, the conversation around demand is the demand for our service. And certainly, our customers they may not have the same type of volumes. So, we're still picking up. We haven't lost any customer accounts. We're still making pickups every day, but it may just be. They don't have the same number of shipments to give us, because some of the demand for their product has decreased. But, I think the positive takeaway from this is how strong we continue to see one the strength of our pricing programs, but just those customer conversations and no customer defections and the conversation about the need for service and how important that is becoming to your customers. We've certainly proven our value proposition over years. And how -- we may be a little bit more expensive upfront, but when you look at the total cost of transportation, whether it's delivering and meeting the on-time and full requirements that some of the retailers have in place, we can ultimately help our customers save money. And so those are the things that continue to drive these positive customer conversations that we're having. Yes. We do always give a wage increase at the beginning of September each year. And so that's pretty standard in terms of, it's in our numbers and it's part of the reason, why the third quarter operating ratio is generally higher, than the second. But from an overall inflation standpoint, when we started the year, we expected higher inflation in the first half. And really, we started seeing cost increasing about this point in time last year. And so our costs are going up, and that's when you can really start seeing -- when we looked at contracts that were turning over in those periods, we had to get larger increases then. So we felt like we were going to see some moderation, with our cost in the back half of this year. But certainly, did perceive the sustained increase in fuel prices and NIM continue to accelerate like they have this year, and that's having a follow-on effect both directly and indirectly with other pieces of our cost structure. So at this point, I don't expect to see that moderation, like we had initially talked about. But don't necessarily see it, accelerating either from this point. I just think that we're going to continue to see, maybe that core inflation number kind of in that 7% to 9% range like we have. And when you back -- if you take our -- look at our costs, and back the operating supplies and expenses out, which includes fuel, they were up about 10% on a in the second quarter, on a per shipment basis. And so it's certainly -- that's higher than where we thought it would be. And -- but we do have some opportunities like Greg mentioned, we certainly want to continue to focus on improving the productivity of all areas of our operation. I think that can help some of that that cost per shipment inflation. We were able to reduce our purchase transportation in the second quarter. There's still a little bit of miles, that we were outsourcing in the second quarter. So we're back in that 2% to 2.5% range number, with that line item, but there may be a little bit more out of that number where we can see some decreases. But otherwise, it's just trying to manage each and every line item on the income statement that we can and look for areas, with discretionary spending that we can pull back on and just look for any area that we can ultimately save some dollars. Yes. Again, I think that when you look at the rest of the group excluding us, I think overall, there's been at least the past three quarters or so where volumes have been negative and -- or at least flat and going back to last year. And so it's -- the environment has continued to -- the pricing environment that is, has continued to remain positive and we haven't heard anything any different really in that regard. So, I think that we know what our strategies are and what we're going to continue to do, a big piece of our yield management strategy is making sure that we're trying to cover the cost inflation we see in our business, but an even bigger element is making sure that we're generating the returns, that will help us continue to invest dollars in the real estate network. And I think when you look over the last 10 years, we've invested about $2 billion in expanding the capacity of our network and when you look at the expansion of our door capacity is about a little over 50% over that 10-year timeframe and at least the number of service centers in the industry is actually down a few percent.  So regardless, if you see some additions here and there, we have been adding really at our customers' requests and our customers are leveraging our network especially in the retail side, some of this e-commerce freight comes and transitions from the truckload world into LTL, that's the power of our network. It helps our customers with managing their supply chains. And ultimately, we think helping them save money overall. So that's why we've got to continue to work at it, but it's still an environment where we've got positive revenue growth.  And our revenue growth of 18% includes that slight decrease in July for tons that we're seeing, but we're still producing revenue growth that's above our long-term average revenue growth rate when you look over the last 10 years. And so, we're just going to continue to look at leveraging that to the bottom line. And certainly, kind of what we talked about with the operating ratio, moving into the third quarter that would still produce some pretty good improvement there on the next quarter's a lot. Well, I think if you look back 2019 is a good example where the environment was softer. And I think the industry was pretty disciplined with pricing during that period. So, we certainly expect that our own pricing will continue to be positive. And again, we haven't really heard anything from any other carriers. We'll continue to see maybe what they're saying publicly as well. But I think it takes a lot to run an LTL company. Certainly, there's a network effect that has to be managed there. And that's the big difference between us and the truckload environment. I think that it seems to us from what we've heard that, there's not many LTL carriers at least the public ones that have taken on a lot of truckload spillover freight. So, I don't think you're going to see this vacuum effect as truckload has loosened a little bit of freight spilling back into that mode like, we may have seen in prior cycles as well either. So, to me that would lend itself to seeing a little bit more stability maybe with volumes even though like I mentioned they're down for the other carriers or have been for the last few quarters. We'll continue to watch that. But I think we would expect to see the continuation of a disciplined approach much like we did in 2019. Well hiring practices that's something that each one of our 255 service center managers are responsible for. They have to stay engaged with their customers at the local level to know what freight demand within their facility is going to look like to then make sure that they've got the right people capacity in place to be able to respond and give the service that our customers demand from us.  So that's something that we let them manage. It's not just the number of people they have in place. There's always managing the hours worked up and down based on changes with the volumes as well. So, we just got to continue to watch overall how the volumes trend and we feel good about our numbers right now and we feel good about our overall level of headcount as well. But ultimately, we'll continue to let our service centers manage that and individually maybe see seeing some that are making additions because they're growing and we're seeing in some facilities really strong double-digit outbound type of revenue and volume growth. And then the others, if they've got some weakness in their facility for whatever reason specific customer type of issues they -- they've got to manage on the other side. But it's a coordinated effort that's really -- we give that responsibility with oversight obviously. But our service center managers are handling that on a day-to-day basis. Yes. I think we're always sitting on idle capacity and that's really what we want to have in place. And we generally target having 20% to 25% excess capacity at all times. And the reason for that is as quickly as demand can change, you can't put service center capacity in place quick enough. And it takes doors in an LTL network to really process freight and be able to grow. Certainly, you got to have equipment and people as well, but the doors are really what takes the most time to get in place. And it's why when we see these positive inflections in the domestic economy that you see the rate of market share growth for us increased significantly where we're outperforming the rest of the group by double digits if you will. And so it's -- you've got to put in place, you got to have a consistent investment process and just continuing to work at it knowing where things are tighter and where you might be tight in a couple of years' time if volume comes back to you in a big way. So we're used to carrying that extra cost, but that's part of our strategy and it is different. We like to keep that excess capacity in place. Most of the industry it seems operates closer to full utilization within the network and -- but that creates a lot of volume opportunities like we saw in 2020 in the back half as the recovery began and certainly through 2021 with the rate of growth that we had then and so far through the first half of this year. And again, as we said earlier, we've produced over $700 million of revenue growth. So last year was a record at $1.2 billion for us and we're on a good pace to have another $1 billion plus type of revenue growth year, but it certainly takes making those investments. And when you look and trying to go back into some of these prior years when there has been a down cycle. You can look at our operating ratio in 2016-2019 we're able to manage all of our variable costs well and try to take advantage of productivity opportunities. But generally the only change in the operating ratio you might see is with respect to that depreciation line item and that's where we are making those investments those depreciation cost will increase as a percent of revenue. But we try to manage all of the other costs flat or with some improvement if we can to minimize any type of negative impact on the operating ratio until we get that volume flow coming through again. And we've said it takes density and yields to produce long-term margin improvement and that will continue into the future as well. But certainly need to get that density factor it takes a continuous investment in capacity. Well, certainly the repurchase program we typically look at our cash from operations. And at the beginning of every year we know what our CapEx is going to be. And then we've got the fixed return element through the dividend program and then we typically take the balance and try to put that into the share repurchase program. But we have said in prior periods when we think the opportunity is right, we'll put more dollars into that program. And certainly that's how we have felt this year. In the first quarter, we did have a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program. In the second quarter it was more strategic and just day-to-day buying on a more of a 10b-5 type of basis. And we'll continue to look at all options as we move forward. But certainly, when the share price is at the level where it's been, it's certainly down from where we finished last year and we're going to continue to buy more shares and use the cash that's on the balance sheet for starters and you just got to continue to look at it on a day-to-day basis. We've -- in the past we've said we don't necessarily want to directly borrow to go out to buy stock. But we've always just got to look at kind of where the price is trending and what we think the best use of cash is and then just trying to take a longer-term view of it as well. Correct. Yes. I don't know that we can comment on our competitors' cost structures, but certainly for us we obviously feel like we've got opportunity to continue to one to try to reduce some of our costs through productivity. But that's again, kind of, going back to our continuous improvement cycle and then trying to price above cost. And it's not always on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Again, it's not always going to be that we've got that 100 basis point to 150 basis point delta in our revenue per shipment and cost per shipment performance, and you've got to look at that on a more of a core basis. But we just look at it over a longer-term time horizon. But that's the yield improvements, one big element for the long-term margin improvement opportunities that we think we have. And I mean obviously a lot goes into that. It's easy to sit here and say that we need yield above cost, but a lot go into both of those metrics. And certainly you got to have a service to support the yield. And then we've got to continue to look at ways that we can save on the cost side as well to make sure that our price deal in alignment with the market. And we do believe we can get a price premium in the market based on the quality of our service and we study our Mastio Quality results closely each year to look at how we compare against ourselves and how we compare against the rest of the industry to make sure that we're staying on top of changes. We're staying ahead of the market. We're continuing to give our customers what they are asking for as well, be it through capacity in markets, be it capacity of our trailer pool, technologies, pricing programs, and new changes there. You name it, we're always trying to stay ahead of the curve and we feel confident that we've got a lot of market share opportunities in front of us and we just want to keep our focus on execution to make sure we take advantage of those opportunities and again make sure that it's not just growth it's good profitable growth. No. And again that's part of our continuous improvement cycle. Our contracts in our business come up every day. It's why you generally see on a sequential basis improvements in our yield metrics as we go from quarter-to-quarter. So, as a contract comes up for renewal, we're going to ask for an increase. And to improve the yield on an account, it's not always through a price increase either. It's looking at other areas of opportunity in ways that we can help a customer save money and that may be an operational change. It could be a number of things and that's why it's so important for our sales team to stay engaged with the customers to understand what their needs are. Our pricing team as well, so that we can work together and create win-win situations because we're not here to just have a customer for this quarter and the next quarter. We've got customers that have been in place for many, many years. And any new customer that's coming on board, we want them to be in place for the long-term as well. So, it's all about creating those win-win situations. And whether it's again through an operational change, we've recently announced a new pricing program as well that we've got some engagement on and some excitement that can eliminate the need to have payment all the services for customers. And so those are the ways that we're going to continue to stay engaged with our customer base and try to do right things right by them and keep improving our sales both the top and the bottom-lines."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\n I'd now like to turn the conference over to Drew Andersen. Drew Andersen, please go ahead. \nDrew Andersen: Thank you.

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but we do ask in fairness to all that you limit yourselves to just a few questions at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation.\n At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir. \nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team successfully launched another year by delivering first quarter results that included new company records for both revenue and earnings per diluted share. We began the year with significant momentum in our business and expected that we would continue to win market share in 2022.\n This expectation has already become reality, as the 32.9% increase in revenue was the fifth straight quarter where we recorded double-digit revenue growth. We also improved our operating ratio to a first quarter company record of 72.9%, which drove our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our revenue growth for the quarter included a 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 12% increase in LTL tons per day. The improvements in both freight density and yield created operating leverage that allowed us to improve our cost categories as a percent of revenue which also drove the improvement in our operating ratio.\n Density and yield are the key ingredients to long-term improvement in our operating ratio and both generally require the support of a favorable domestic economy. We expect to further improve each of these 2 elements as we work through 2022. Demand for our superior service has remained consistently strong, and we do not see that changing in the foreseeable future based on recent conversations with both our customers and our sales team.\n We continue to receive feedback regarding the general lack of capacity within the LTL industry. This feedback is not unexpected, given that the LTL industry has seen a net decrease in the number of service centers over the past 10 years, at least for the public group, excluding OD. Customers also appear to be dealing with lower inventory balances than they would prefer, which can result in missed revenue opportunities for them. We have unfortunately heard similar stories from our suppliers and have seen little improvement with their inventories this year. We believe these issues are driving many new customers and increased shipments from existing customers to OD.\n Despite all of the general industry and supply chain challenges, Old Dominion has continued to maintain our service center capacity to support our customers' growth. This has been and remains an integral piece of our value proposition, and we are well positioned to benefit from the continued strength in demand for both our superior service performance and network capacity.\n We have opened 3 new service centers this year and currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity. These additions were part of our 2022 expansion plan that targets an additional 5 to 7 new facilities this year. While our service center network is in good shape, we are continuing to work on the other 2 pieces of the overall capacity equation. We increased our average number of full-time employees by 18.5% during the first quarter, and we expect to continue hiring additional employees during the second quarter to support our anticipated growth.\n As the capacity of the OD team increases, we would like to reduce our reliance on purchased transportation. To accomplish this, however, we will need to increase the capacity of our fleet. While our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes approximately $485 million for equipment. We are experiencing delays with the delivery of new equipment. These delays were anticipated and limit our ability to effectively match the receipt of new equipment with the expected seasonal increase in our volumes. As a result, and similar to 2021, we will operate existing equipment that would have otherwise been replaced and use purchased transportation as needed to support our growth.\n As part of our effort to deliver best-in-class service for our customers, we remain committed to ensuring that each element of capacity is in place to support our ability to win long-term market share. As we continue to manage through the short-term challenges within the current freight market. We will also maintain our focus on long-term opportunities for our business by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has helped us achieve a 10-year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of approximately 11% and 24%, respectively.\n As part of this plan, we have consistently invested significant resources to support the doubling of our market share over the past 10 years. This has included a significant investment in our OD family of employees to help ensure that each employee is motivated and rewarded for providing superior service to our customers. We believe that consistently providing customers with superior service at a fair price and regularly investing in our people, equipment and network capacity to stay ahead of anticipated volume growth will support our long-term growth initiatives. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce further profitable growth and increased shareholder value.\n Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. \nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2022 increased 32.9% to a company record of $1.5 billion. While our operating ratio improved 320 basis points to 72.9%. The combination of these factors resulted in a 52.9% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.60 for the quarter. Our revenue per day increased 30.8% as the first quarter of this year included one extra work day. This growth was balanced between increases in our volumes and yield, both of which continue to be supported by a favorable domestic economy.\n We continue to win a significant amount of market share as demand for our superior service and available network capacity to remain consistently strong during the quarter. As a result, the year-over-year growth in our revenue and volumes continued to trend above our longer-term averages. LTL tons per day increased 12% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 17.4%. While changes in our freight mix contributed to the increases in this yield metric, the 10% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects the success of our long-term pricing strategy. Our consistent strategy is designed to offset cost inflation, while also supporting further investments in capacity by focusing on the individual profitability of each customer account.\n On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 1.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. With LTL tons per day decreasing 1.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 2.2%. Our revenue per day performance during the first quarter, both with and without fuel surcharges, exceeded our 10-year average sequential trends, although our volumes were below our 10-year trends. It is important to remember, however, that our 10-year average trends include the doubling of our market share. As a result, there may be quarterly periods where sequential performance may be below our 10-year trends despite solid year-over-year performance. The first quarter is a good example as we believe we won a significant amount of market share and produced solid profitable growth as a result.\n The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January decreased 5.8% as compared with December, February increased 5.1% versus January, and March increased 3.6% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.6% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.6% in March.\n While there are still a few work days that remain in April, our revenue growth continues to be very strong and reflects the favorable demand environment described earlier by Greg. Our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 28% when compared to April of 2021. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q.\n Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 72.9%, with improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in our salaries, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue effectively offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n We improved overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter, primarily by leveraging our revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we expect our core inflation, excluding fuel, to be between 4.5% to 5% for the year, with higher inflation in the first half of the year that is expected to moderate in the back half. We believe our fuel surcharge program is effectively offsetting the increased cost of our fuel and our yield management strategy is effectively offsetting cost increases in other areas. As we continue to experience cost increases related to our real estate network as well as with our equipment, parts and repairs, it will be critical to maintain our focus on productivity while continuing to control discretionary spending to minimize the overall effect on our cost per shipment.\n Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $388.7 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $93.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $825 million this year, which includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. We utilized $438.4 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $34.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total amount for share repurchases includes a $400 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter.\n Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter 2022.\n This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. \nJonathan Chappell: Adam, if I could start with you, in the last few quarters, you can kind of throw all of your historical seasonal OR trends out the window, just very robust pricing environment, you're doing much better than 10-year trends. As you start to anniversary some of these big pricing and tonnage moves over the last several quarters, do you envision a return to kind of the long-term trend margin seasonality? Or some of these vast market share gains that you're making going to continue to make those trend in a more favorable momentum? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that certainly, some of the quarters, those trends are very consistent. We've talked before about the first quarter and the fourth quarters can be a little bit more movement versus the average, just given the variability at times with revenue trends in those periods and certain costs that trend in various ways in those periods as well. But I think we've certainly performed very well the last couple of years and produced a lot of operating ratio improvement.\n I think regardless of the seasonal sequential changes from quarter-to-quarter, we always talk about the -- over the long term that we generally expect we've seen and would expect to continue to see 100 to 150 basis points of operating ratio improvement. And a lot of that gets back to our focus with our pricing philosophy. We try to achieve revenue per shipment growth of 100 to 150 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And when you look over the last 10, 15 years, including fuel in both of those metrics, that's what we've been able to achieve.\n So certainly, some years when we've got significant revenue growth like we saw last year and certainly, in the environment that we're in right now, where we're growing revenue at about 30% in the first quarter, a little over that. Certainly, it's a good environment to keep driving improvement in the operating ratio maybe above those longer-term averages. But over time, that's certainly part of the focus is to continue with that same type of mentality with our yield management philosophy. \nJonathan Chappell: Got it. And a follow-up for Greg. Last quarter, you specifically called out some of the issues you've had with some of your suppliers being unable to get the equipment that you would have liked to have to grow and maybe some of the elevated maintenance expense associated with that. But given how low your CapEx was in 1Q vis-a-vis your full year number. Are you expecting some of these supplier constraints to kind of lift so you'd have a very back-end loaded spend and get the equipment that you're looking for by the end of the year? \nGreg Gantt: Yes. I'm not sure it's going to get a whole lot better. I mean, the equipment that we had planned to receive this year was planned to be delivered later in the year than we would normally take it. Typically, we would start taking trucks, especially late in the first quarter on through the early fall. And then the delivery would pretty much -- deliveries would pretty much be over. We would have what we had purchased for that calendar -- particular calendar year. And this year, it's just -- it's a lighter build from the get-go. That's what we were told. So that's the difference. It's just coming a little bit later. We're getting a little bit less than we had hoped to get, and we're getting a little -- getting it later. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. \nJack Atkins: So I guess, maybe to start, Adam, if we could go back to your April commentary for a moment, obviously, there are a lot of changes taking place in the freight markets kind of broadly. I was just maybe curious if you could kind of comment on April, relative to March so far and how it's trending versus either your expectations for April as you were kind of going into the months or just relative to normal seasonality, just sort of curious if you could maybe kind of give us an update there on how the month has trended versus plan. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. It's, I mean, a continuation of strong revenue growth, 28% is about where we are. Continuing to see strong yield performance, which that has certainly continued throughout the first quarter and same types of trends into April for sure. So it's a reflection of our ability to continue to win market share. We talked about it earlier that, as we continue to have conversations with our customers and with our sales team. We continue to get positive feedback as it relates to demand for our service. And many of these conversations center on the lack of general capacity within LTL and LTL is different from truckload.\n And I think a lot of shippers have seen the value of LTL. And certainly, the e-commerce effect on supply chains, there's been movement of freight within LTL that we believe will stay, and we believe we'll continue to see tailwinds on over time for the industry, and we think we can be the biggest participant in winning share as that industry continues to grow, much like we've been the biggest share win over the last 10 years.\n So certainly, that's our plan is to keep investing ahead of growth and keep delivering service value that's better than anyone else in our industry. We've got an unmatched value proposition and our customers continue to respond to that. And so that will be our focus, is to continue delivering best-in-class service and making sure we've got the capacity to support our customers' growth. \nJack Atkins: Okay. No, that makes sense. And that's great to hear on April. So I guess maybe for my follow-up question, just kind of going back to Jon's point on operating ratio and sort of thinking about seasonality into the second quarter. Typically, over the last couple of years, you guys have seen between 350 to 400 basis points of sequential improvement, 1Q to 2Q. Adam, is there anything to kind of keep in mind as we sort of think about this year, in particular, moving from the first quarter to the second quarter? And do you think that, that type of normal seasonality is the right way to kind of think about it? I mean, that would imply an operating ratio in the upper 60s. So just sort of curious if you could maybe give us some thoughts on that? \nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Certainly, in the first quarter, when you look at some of the sequential changes that we had from 4Q. We outperformed what the normal seasonality was and what we had talked about our target was going to be coming into the fourth quarter -- or first quarter, rather, from the fourth. And some of the benefits that we saw really a variance from the 10-year trend were in our miscellaneous expenses. Those costs were lower. Those normally are about 0.5%. They were lower and we got some benefit, normally see an increase. They are general supplies and expenses, also were favorable to our longer-term trend.\n And some of those reflect control over discretionary spending like we talked about. And then some other things, were just -- there's times where you get some favorability and especially on those miscellanies expenses and other times where it could go the other way. It's usually 0.5% plus or minus. So we'd expect some of these items that potentially could increase.\n And I would just say, if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter and look at seasonality from fourth to first and then second, that would have put our operating ratio just above a 70%. But I can tell you, we'd be pleased with that, but we're really focused on being able to see an OR that starts with a 6. So anything that starts with a 6 is going to be good by us. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. \nUnknown Analyst: James on for Allison. Actually, just to clarify on the previous question, you expect both those to normalize moving forward and not necessarily was it a reset in this quarter in terms of those expense levels? \nAdam Satterfield: Are you talking about the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses? \nUnknown Analyst: Correct. \nAdam Satterfield: Well, like I said, miscellaneous generally is around 0.5%, and it was at 0.2% of revenue in the first quarter. So we would expect that to move back to where it's historically trended now again. It's not to say that some of the favorable trends that we saw in the first quarter couldn't repeat. There's a lot of elements that go into that miscellaneous expense. But it's more normalized around that 0.5%. And then certainly, in some of the things in the general supplies and expenses we could continue to see some increases there as well. But no specific guidance, if you will, to say what that's going to be, but it wouldn't be unexpected to see that increase, if you will. \nUnknown Analyst: Got it. Just wanted to clarify. And you called out that you had 15% to 20% capacity in terms of service centers and you also had some issues with the equipment deliveries. But overall, how much capacity do you think you do have in your network at the moment across sort of the 3 metrics you've track -- or you've encouraged us to track around employees, trucks and service centers? Like do you actually have capacity to take on incremental volume from here? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, certainly, that's our expectation is to continue to produce growth. And the piece of the capacity equation that you always have to look at is on the service center side. It takes doors to process freight within LTL. And so that is the more determinant figure in terms of how much from the levels where we currently are that we can continue to grow. And we generally like to have somewhere 20% to 25% excess capacity. So our CapEx plan this year includes about $300 million to further expand the capacity of our overall service center network. We've opened the 3 facilities so far this year, and we've got more that are slated as we proceed through the year to keep expanding the number of service centers and some of those dollars are increasing doors at existing locations as well.\n Now when it comes to the people side of the equation and the fleet, much like you've seen in our numbers over the last couple of years, the lever that we pull there is we have to use purchased transportation if we need to supplement one or the other of those pieces of the capacity equation. Certainly, we've stepped up the increased use of purchased transportation. We were actually pleased to see that the outsourced miles that we had in the first quarter have actually trended down versus where we were in just the fourth quarter of last year. So we're continuing to make progress there as we continue to add people to our OD family. We had an 18.5% increase in the number of full-time employees. So we're continuing to be successful there and attracting new people to our business and retaining those that we already have. And then we're continuing to balance the capacity of our fleet.\n As Greg mentioned in prepared comments, there's multiple ways to do that. We're having to hang on to some of the older equipment. We will get some relief later in the year we hope, with deliveries of what's been ordered, if you will. But again, we can use purchased transportation as needed to supplement there. So I think we've got those pieces covered, and we're continuing to give 99% on-time service performance with the claims ratio between 0.1% and 0.2%. So it's best-in-class service despite the significant volume of growth and processing significant growth on top of the growth that we had last year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. \nChris Wetherbee: So Adam, maybe we could talk a little bit about yields and sort of how you maybe see that playing out over the next couple of quarters. I think we're starting to hit some of the tougher comps when we look at revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel, starting in the second quarter. I guess maybe two questions here. First, is the step-up of the comps kind of happened immediately in April? So is that sort of the trigger as you move from 1Q to 2Q were already beginning to lap those sort of more challenging comps? \n And I guess the second part, bigger picture piece of the question would be just how you think about sort of the pricing environment, your ability to sort of continue to get price, you talked about inflation being 4.5% to 5%. So presumably, you're sort of targeting somewhere in that, call it, 6% to 6.5%, maybe 7% range. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about it? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly, the increases that we need in the first half of this year are going to be higher, just like we talked about the expectations on our inflation. We started seeing really the inflation pick up in the middle of last year. And so as contracts were maturing in, we were having to start asking for more. We look at the current environment as those mature and what we're seeing and what we expect. And we're always making predictions for multiple things, what our volumes are going to be, as well as our cost and what our customer needs are, but certainly started seeing acceleration in some of those renewals in the back half of last year, and those need to continue as we move through the first half.\n But we are starting to get some normalization on some of the weight per shipment trends. At this point, our weight per shipment is flat with where we were last year. We've seen a decreased weight per shipment over the last year or so as well as an increase in the length of haul. So both of those changes in mix have been supporting that overall reported yield number, and making it look stronger than just the core increases that we're getting.\n But we continue to target cost plus. That's been our long-term pricing philosophy. It's been consistent and one of our customers know and can understand and we'll continue to execute on that same type of philosophy as we progress through the year. But with some of those mix metrics normalizing, when you just look at kind of normalized trends, it would -- if you look at kind of normal seasonality, if you will, just sequential increases from this point forward, it starts coming down. The year-over-year starts getting to the higher single digits to kind of mid-single digits and eventually normalizing, if you will. But certainly, right now, we're able to get increases that are covering our cost inflation, and I think you can see that in our numbers. \nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Okay. That's very helpful. I appreciate that. And you mentioned that the weight per shipment has been ticking up sequentially here after, I think, bottoming kind of in the third quarter. Should we likely to be sort of up on a year-over-year basis as we move forward? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, right now, like I said, we're flat. So as we progress through the second quarter, then we could. If things just sort of hold steady, if you will, from a mix standpoint, then certainly, we would start seeing some increase, and that's kind of the point of you might start seeing the reverse of what we did last year, where the mix change puts a little bit of pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight.\n Certainly, in the third quarter, that was our low watermark. I think we were at 1,538 pounds on average in the third quarter of last year. Right now, we're trending somewhere in the 1,575, so between 1,550, and 1,600 pounds, but it's been a little bit heavier on that scale over the last few months. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. \nScott Group: Adam, I just want to clarify just a couple of things. The 28% increase in revenue in April, is there any way just directionally to break that down between fuel and tonnage and sort of underlying yields? And then I was also just a little confused about your commentary around the second quarter OR about normal seasonalities of 70-something, but you're hoping for 60-something. I just -- I wasn't -- I was little confused, so if you can help there. \nAdam Satterfield: All right. I'll try to clarify that first. I'll just talk about our revenue growth, and we don't want to necessarily give the details. We'll wait unless the month settle out. But like I kind of referenced earlier, in March, we saw revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel, that was up about 9%. And that's about the same year-over-year change that we're seeing.\n From fuel, we never really get into the breaking down fuel contributions, but the average price per gallon in March is about the same in April. And so it's averaging about a little over 5 -- about $5.11, $5.12. So there's about a 62% increase in that DOE price per gallon in March, and the same type of increase that we're seeing in April. So we'll have similar contributions, if you will, there. So the overall yield continues to show considerable strength and the comparisons start looking a little bit different, if you will, on the volume side.\n And when you look at last year and what the revenue growth was, we had total revenue growth of about 16% in the first quarter of last year, and it was 47% in the second quarter. So those will certainly change as we progress through the second quarter, the comparisons get a little bit tougher. Which is why we're extremely pleased to see the strong revenue growth at 28% in April. But you'll continue to see contributions like that. The yield is certainly driving a lot of that revenue growth for us right now, but seeing very solid volume performance as well.\n In terms of the operating ratio, don't want to give specific guidance per se, but my point was we certainly had some favorability in the first quarter. I mentioned the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses and that those could revert back. So there certainly could be some pressure on that normal sequential change that we see from the first to second quarter. One other thing that was beneficial was we had lower fringe costs in the first quarter than what I expected for the year, and that's fringe cost as a percent of our salaries and wages. So I would expect that to kind of normalize back to where I thought it would be for the year. So there may be a little bit of pressure on a couple of those items. Time will tell and we'll see.\n But my point was if you just took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, certainly, we had big outperformance in 1Q. But if you took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter and ran it through to the second, that would have put our operating ratio right in a 70.2%. And we'll see that would imply less seasonal improvement than what we normally expect. And what the point of the matter was if we operate anywhere that starts with a 6, it fits a 69.9%, we will certainly be very excited to see that kind of number.\n We're sitting here like Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed trying to do something that they said couldn't be done. And we think that we can get it done. But certainly, if it comes out that it's about 70.1% or 70.2% that's producing very strong profitable growth as well. But nevertheless, not throwing necessarily a specific target out there, but just saying what could be done with some of the numbers and how they might normally train it. \nScott Group: Okay. Yes. Most of the others get excited about starting with an 8. You made a comment about LTL is different than truckload. So, I'm guessing that LTL is very different than spot truckload, but there's a lot of focus on spot rates right now. What -- how does slowing falling spot rates impact in any way your tonnage outlook, your pricing outlook? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, from a tonnage standpoint, that was the point we wanted to make was that what's going on in truckload right now. We are already last year, had taken a lot of the heavier weighted shipments that might be considered spillover freight in prior periods and had worked those out of our systems. So we don't have those same pressures, and I don't think many of the other LTL carriers do either, just looking at some of the statistics. I think freight demand had been so solid and influx of freight into the LTL world that many carriers and certainly, us, we can speak to specifically, were just focused on long-term LTL freight, not something that might be more transactional here today going tomorrow type of thing if truckload capacity loosened up.\n So we're not seeing the same type of pressures and not really hearing about it from an overall competitive landscape either, that there's some movement of freight going back into the truckload world. But certainly something that we'll continue to pay attention to, and we're talking very frequently with customers and our sales team. But again, that's consistent feedback that we're receiving from all parties is that demand continues to be solid.\n And certainly, numbers are what they are and part of the conversation in our prepared remarks talking about 10-year trends and so forth, we've doubled our market share over the last 10 years. And that doesn't always come in a linear fashion. So we might have a month where volumes underperform for a monthly period, our 10-year average trends, and that's just certainly not something to get overly concerned about. And we saw some of that in the first quarter. We underperformed, if you just look purely from a 10-year average sequential standpoint, on the volume side, but we produced a lot of revenue growth and good profit growth as a result.\n So we continue to be encouraged by the overall environment, and the feedback that we're hearing from customers and our sales team and want to continue to do what it takes to take advantage of the volume flows that may come our way this year. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger: Curious, realizing that things are very strong today. If we do or were to go into a slower economic situation later this year into next year, maybe negative growth. Given the headcount increases you've had and obviously, wage increases across the sector, I mean, how flexible or nimble do you think you guys would be sort of in the other direction in terms of pulling things back and can you with wage increases and headcount? \nGreg Gantt: Jordan, we've done this in the past. I mean, I don't think anybody likes to manage through a downturn or a recession or whatever you want to call it, but we've done it in the past. It's surely not a lot of fun and you have to make hard decisions at times. But we've managed through the worst recession ever in 2009, at least in my pretty lengthy career, it's probably the worst ever. We managed through that fairly well. Then we did it again in '16 and through a flat year in '19. So we've geared up, then we've geared down and gear back up and this business is up and down. It always has been. But if we have to manage in a downturn, I've got all the confidence in the world we can manage through that.\n As Adam mentioned, though, so far, so good this year, our trends are good. Our feedback from customers are -- is very strong. We've had 2 of our top 10 accounts in the building in the last couple of weeks. And they're both very positive on their business and their customers and these were logistics companies, by the way. They're huge, and they manage an awful lot of dollars. And their outlook is very strong at this point in time. I think our standing with these particular accounts and with our accounts in general, our standing is better than ever. And at this point in time, we're not thinking about a downturn. If we have to, we will. But that's not where we are today. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Todd Fowler with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nTodd Fowler: So I wanted to ask on where you think you're at from a headcount growth standpoint. I know you've had success in adding headcount, but it's been about above tonnage and shipment growth now for the past couple of quarters. You have some comments in the release about continuing to add headcount in 2Q. Do you think you're getting to the point where headcount is caught up with where your tonnage levels are? How do you think about continued headcount growth into the back half of the year? \nGreg Gantt: Yes. Todd, I think we are -- we -- I think we have pretty much caught up. We still have some needs in some places, but we're much closer than we've been probably in the best shape we've been in over a year. So happy with that, happy with where we are. And we'll just have to see how the volume trends continue. If we continue on our current growth trajectory, then we will have to continue to add some as our seasonality dictates, but I think those needs will be fewer certainly than they were in the last year or so. But yes, we're in a better spot and feel pretty good about our standing today. And that wouldn't be a bad thing to see that continue to level off a little bit. \nTodd Fowler: Yes. No, understood. That's a good comment. That's helpful there. And then, Greg, just a follow-up, in your prepared remarks, you had a lot of comments around shippers really realizing the value of the LTL service proposition. I guess, I'm curious, are you seeing any shift in your mix as far as kind of your core customer base? And I know it would just be around the edges not a big wholesale shift, but kind of different shippers using LTL relative to where you've been historically. And when you think about the tonnage growth that you've been experiencing do you think that most of that's because of your available capacity? Is there something else within the industry that's driving that? \nGreg Gantt: Todd, not that I know of, not at all. I think it's just continued growth from existing accounts. Certainly, we continue to take on new business. We have a very significant group of sales folks working out there every day. So we do continue to gain some new business from the reports that I'm seeing, but no normal growth from existing customers. I think just the continued confidence that they have in us and the service performance that we've given in the past and they like it. Their customers need that. Their supply chains, as Adam mentioned, supply chains are challenged and putting that product on the shelf more important now than probably ever. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. \nRavi Shanker: A couple of follow-ups. One to the kind of downturn planning question. I'm sure you guys are aware that most of your peers and a lot of investors have been trying to figure out what your secret sauce has been for years and why there isn't one answer. I think one of the big elements is your continued kind of investments almost irrespective of the cycle. But I just wanted to get a sense of what benchmarks you guys would look at in terms of turning the wick up or down on the incremental growth plans a -- if there is a downturn, are you going to put your foot down and actually accelerate investments? Or again, what are some of the metrics you look at to start pulling back? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I mean, I think you've got to look at past performance to a degree to see how we react. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we've taken the opportunity in the past and some of those slower periods like you mentioned, to, in some ways, accelerate our investments. And I mentioned earlier that we're probably a little bit behind. We're at 15% to 20% excess capacity. We like being at sort of 20% to 25% on average. And we're a little behind that target range is given the significant volume growth that we've had.\n So we look through a longer-term wins, if you will, and try to project out where we think our market share and our volumes might be in the next 5 to 10 years. It's not just always in the here and now because certainly, you can't execute when it comes to real estate investments in a very short period of time. Oftentimes, and we didn't necessarily see this in the last slow cycle in '19 like we thought we might have, but in prior periods in downturns, we've seen some opportunities come our way that were attractive investments from land opportunities, existing service center opportunities. So certainly, if something becomes available in an area that's on our long-term road map for where we want to go, then yes, we would take advantage of something like that.\n But it's just always sort of looking at what's in front of you, if you will, from an opportunity standpoint and then us thinking about the longer-term opportunity where we want to be, where we think we need to have capacity to support the continued growth within our network and to be able to keep our service metrics where they are today. \nRavi Shanker: Got it. That's good color. And just a follow-up on the topic of keeping an eye on the long term and growth investments. There have been a number of important developments in the path to commercialization of autonomous trucks and obviously, the pressure on most companies to kind of strengthen their ESG footprint with electrification is growing as well. I would love to get an update from you guys on kind of what you're seeing out there, what your investment plans are in both these technologies and maybe kind of the -- what the rollout part looks like, especially if you're going to invest in a downturn? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, we certainly have one, we've just recently disclosed our first ESG sustainability report. So we were proud to get that out. And I think that was a means to show some of the long-term improvements that we've made over time with operating efficiencies and overall improvements in our miles per gallon and so forth, and we'll continue to track towards some of the goals that we have internally to continue to improve those metrics. And one of the key pillars of our foundation for success is continuous improvement, and that means multiple things, continuous improvement in multiple areas.\n But as it relates specifically to electric vehicles and autonomous and so forth, we'll continue to stay engaged with manufacturers to see what's coming down the line. We would like to try to test some of the equipment, and we actually ordered some equipment, but we're still waiting on the delivery of the truck. And so I think that goes to some of the pressures that the OEMs have in terms of what actually is being produced and is planned to be produced in the near-term. We're still from all the feedback we get from specs and capabilities, don't believe that electric trucks as they exist today, really fit the operating model of an LTL network, at least how we run our business.\n But we felt like we wanted to have a seat at the table and that was why we put an order in to get something and actually put it in place to operate and to be able to give true feedback in terms of what the limitations may or may not be. So -- but we'll continue to stay engaged with all of our suppliers in that regard to see as things change and where it may make sense to try to integrate some of that technology into our network as it makes sense or not. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. \nAmit Mehrotra: Appreciate it. So I just had a couple of questions. Adam, just a clarification, did you give April tonnage sequentially from March versus seasonality and year-over-year in April? Can you give that if you hadn't already? \nAdam Satterfield: No, we haven't provided the detail. Consistent with what we've done in the past, we'll give it with our 10-Q, but just gave where we're trending from an overall revenue standpoint and then gave a little extra color on kind of what our yield trends are doing. \nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Fine. And then I guess, bigger picture question, you guys are knocking the cover off the ball on many metrics. Your stock is down 25% this year. I don't want to make too big of a deal of near-term or midterm stock movements, but everybody is debating right now what the peak to trough earnings decline could look like in a very tough macro scenario. And I think part of that reflects the trough to peak has been so robust for OD and many other companies as well. \n So I guess the question is, if I look at the industry, the industry has done a tremendous job of understanding its cost structure a little bit, pricing rationally relative to that, those investments they've made in understanding their cost structure. So do you think that the industry, from a pricing discipline perspective, is just better than it's ever been because of some of those specific investments? And do you think the price -- there's risk in a downturn that the industry pricing just going to breaks down? Just talk about how the pricing discipline for the industry is today versus how it's been kind of been any time in the past. \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I certainly think it's been more disciplined, and you can go back to 2019 and in particular, the second quarter of 2020 as well. I mean, that was a pretty steep drop for everyone from a revenue standpoint. And no one knew how long of a drop we were going to be in. But I think that there was a lot of discipline that was shown. And I think it gets back to -- there's certainly a lot of value that an LTL carrier can offer and there's a lot of expense to running and to expanding an LTL carrier's network. And we certainly have seen that over the years.\n We talk a lot about the cost of expanding our real estate network, the land cost facilities where we have to lease some of the rent rates have almost become prohibitively expensive, but something I thought that way about a couple of years ago may now look like a bargain. So it's one of those things where we've got to continue to build that type of cost escalation into our pricing plans. And I think we'll continue to certainly see our numbers and our philosophy, no change with respect to the cost plus pricing that we've displayed over the years.\n And I think that it's likely that we'll continue to -- we've seen discipline from the other carriers and wouldn't expect any change in that regard. And the industry now, I mean a lot has certainly been written lately about what's going on in truckload. But you've got almost 70% of the LTL revenue that's in publicly-traded companies now. And so it doesn't take long to see what everyone is seeing and doing and certainly, probably more important to see what actually is going on for management teams versus just reading reports off of the Internet that's sensationalized, maybe a little bit more. But I don't think you can all necessarily extrapolate what you're seeing in some of those reports to the LTL world. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. \nKen Hoexter: Greg or Adam, can you -- maybe thoughts on the impact of purchased transportation on quality controls expense? And what is now outsourced, as you talked about maybe growing a bit although, I think, Adam, you mentioned it was down in first quarter versus fourth quarter, but it sounded like you were -- you needed to scale that to meet your growth targets going forward? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly, we were able to use the purchased transportation in an increasing manner as we went through mainly 2021, started stepping it up a little bit in response to the acceleration in volumes that we saw in the back half of 2020. And I'm speaking of the sequential acceleration just to be able to keep pace with the growth and expectations from our customers. But we've got good carriers that we've used to supplement mainly within our line-haul operation. And it's overall still pretty minimal in terms of the outsourced miles.\n Certainly, we saw the cost increasing, if you will, as that rate environment was increasing. But we were able to work those third parties into our network and keep our service metrics high, while responding to significant volume growth from customers last year. And we saw maybe a slight uptick in our claims ratio. That was probably more or somewhat reflective of using third-party truckload carriers versus our 20- and 28-foot pup operation and all the claims prevention tools that we have.\n But when I say it uptick-ed, it uptick-ed from 0.1% something to 0.16% that just rounded to 0.2%. So we're talking very minimal increase there. And that's part of the overall value that we provide to our customers. And Greg mentioned it earlier in his prepared comments that part of our value proposition is having capacity. When you look through prior cycles, look through 2017 and 2018, we were able to grow with our customers right now. And when you look at the other carriers, at least public carriers in the back half of last year were pretty flattish from a volume standpoint.\n So we're able to come in and demonstrate value, not only with the service quality that we offer but being able to provide capacity when no one else can. And so that takes investment. It takes investment in the real estate of fleet and our people. to make sure we've got that flex capacity. And certainly, we always try to stay ahead of the game as best we can in that regard, but certainly pleased that we're able to deliver that for our customers. \nKen Hoexter: Great. I guess for my follow-up, let me just start off with the premise. You talked about doubling your share, but I guess, 1 or 2 of your public peers were kind of closing service centers and kind of maybe shrinking their business, and that's kind of changed, right? So most of your peers are now adding service centers and doors, everybody's kind of set new targets out there. Do you still see the LTL market is structurally growing share within the entire trucking market?\n And then if so, I think a lot of demand questions coming to you now is, where do you see it first, right? Where do you see -- when you see a role, is it the consumer? Do you not see it because e-commerce growth has changed that within the dynamic that you're still growing and taking share, so you wouldn't see that impact? Maybe just set the stage for the dynamic of what goes on in a market these days relatively within the LTL market? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, we've talked about this before, but in our business, the way we try to manage and project out, we always have a baseline forecast for the year. And then we have scenarios with growth above that baseline and scenarios where the volumes are below that baseline, and we try to have a plan for both. We have that baseline plan and then how we're going to execute in either side of that scenario. And all we can do is continuously look at our numbers and have continuous conversations with customers. And certainly, we've had years where we've been above and below our baseline scenarios and you just make operational decisions from that point forward.\n And part of that is the way we structure our network. We give -- each of our service center managers has got control in terms of managing their headcount and running their operation as needed in terms of adding to or are pulling back on some of the additions that they're making depending on what the environment is like and -- but it just takes constant communication between us and our customer base. And oftentimes, a lot of that is communication with many of our third-party logistics customers, 6 of our top 10 largest customers are 3PLs, and they're a fair amount of our overall business, and they generally have a read on what's going on and if there's mode shift and other things. And we still get favorable feedback from them with respect to the expectations for volumes this year. And so that kind of goes into our baseline and maybe why some of our conversation and thinking might seem a little bit different than what others might be talking about with respect to overall transportation this year. \nKen Hoexter: Great. And your thought, just to wrap that up, the thought within the LTL market, do you still see it structurally taking share within the -- in the trucking side? Just to understand it like -- yes. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes, we do. I feel like it will continue to grow. And right now, we've got -- when you look at all the industrial numbers, those are all favorable for sure, and we're seeing good growth. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was pretty balanced between both our industrial and our retail-related business. We're continuing to see consumer spending. But irrespective of that, there's freight demand for LTL carriers and shippers that this e-commerce effect on supply chains that are leveraging the network that we've built out in moving freight if it's a manufacturer that is moving freight.\n In yesteryear, it may have been one full truckload of goods to a regional distribution center that may be 10 different fulfillment centers in that same region. And we can fill one truckload basically, one full van of goods at that same manufacturer. But they're now leveraging our network as we distribute those goods throughout our system and to that ultimate fulfillment center.\n And so we think that type of change will continue to drive volumes into the LTL industry. And I think that given the investments that we've made and the requirements too, from the big box retailers for their vendors shipping product in, most have on-time-in-full or must-arrive-by-date type of programs. And certainly, it's a focus on the on-time deliveries and no damages. And when you've got the best metrics like we do, that's how we can add further value to our customers by making sure that they show well on their vendor scorecards with their customers. And that's been a piece of the market share that we've won over the last 10 years, and we think that, that trend will continue going forward. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. \nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. It's Tom. Sorry, I was on mute there. I guess a little bit of a follow-up on that last one. What the kind of consumer goods spending and potential weakness seems like a key point of concern. So what does your mix look like broad brush? I know sometimes it's hard to be overly precise. But if you say, well, the 2016 cycle, when we saw weakness, we had kind of x amount consumer and y amount industrial, and then maybe in 2019 and today, has it skewed a lot more towards consumer? Or how do you think about a high level, that mix of your book that's if you want to put it in industrial and consumer or if you wanted to include other buckets? \nAdam Satterfield: I mean, it's still more weighted to industrial than retail. About 55% to 60% of our revenue is industrial related and 25% to 30% is retail related, but it's -- that's probably moved up the spectrum closer to that 30% threshold. And I mentioned that we've seen a lot of good growth in our -- with our retail customers and we have. I mean, that's been a big part of the story. But we continue to see good growth in market share with our industrial customers as well. And there have been periods where that retail was growing a bit faster, but both are growing for us, and we're still seeing good share there. So it's -- that retail component has crept up a little bit, but our good industrial business has grown as well and has continued to somewhat keep pace. \nThomas Wadewitz: Are you hearing -- I don't know if this is the type of -- if you have clear input from customers on this. But are you hearing a difference in the outlook between those 2 customer segments or the consumer-related customers more cautious and the industrial side is more aggressive? And I guess, I think, Greg, you commented on inventories, too, that you thought inventories were still light. I don't know if there's a difference in kind of urgency for industrial versus consumer? \nAdam Satterfield: No. It's -- we look at the inventory to sales ratio, and that continues to be low and really reconciles the feedback that we're getting from customers, be it on the retail or the industrial side that inventory balances are lower than what they prefer them to be. We have an awful lot of conversation about the number of back orders that many are dealing with, and in some cases, missed opportunities where they simply haven't had product on the shelf for ready now if it's a online purchase, if you will. And so I think that's something that Greg mentioned earlier that we're seeing and hearing not only from the customer side, but we're seeing it and feeling it from our supplier side as well.\n So both kind of go hand in hand and many of our suppliers are also customers. So we're seeing that across the board, if you will. But that's why we think that even -- I mean right now, consumer spending continues to be strong. I think household balance sheets are good and maybe consumer confidence is not as high as it has been. But we still feel like freight demand can continue for past any type of consumption slowdown just given the fact that we feel like inventory balances need to be built back up. And we continue to believe that long term, we'll see a higher inventory to sales ratio than perhaps where we were, pre-pandemic. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors: Not to beat a dead horse with another hypothetical recession scenario, but -- and it's clear that you don't think there is a structural change to the investment you've been able to invest in -- or I'm sorry, to the situation you've been able to invest into and make a tremendous amount of return over the last 10 years. But I'm curious, what -- as you think about scenarios, not just the kind of scenario analysis you talked about in a single year, but in that 5- to 10-year plan where you're looking where to invest and where to buy land and where to build more capacity, what would it take to maybe change that strategy? Is it seeing less discipline in pricing at your peers? Is it a consistent run of sub-seasonal tonnage versus the share gain you've gotten historically? I'm just curious what you would have to see to actually make a change in the way that you approach the market price long term. \nGreg Gantt: Yes. Bascome, if -- again, a big if, and I know it's a hypothetical, but if we saw a major downturn of some kind, and all of a sudden, we had excessive capacity, maybe we would look to do something different. But to tell you the truth, as Adam mentioned earlier, sometimes in a downturn, it provides the best opportunity for you to go out and do some things in certain markets that are extremely difficult to get them done. And that maps an opportunity for us and give us that very, very difficult place that we desperately need.\n So I hate to talk too much about hypotheticals, but we'll certainly take advantage of the market if it provides some opportunities for us. We've got to be opportunistic. I've talked about it in the past, how difficult it is now to acquire land in certain parts of the country, how difficult it is to get building started and whatnot. And I think we'd be terribly remiss if we sat back and said all things that really slowed down, and we shouldn't do this.\n And if you can flip the switch and build a facility in 6 months or even a year, that's one thing. But when we know in some of these markets, it's 2, 3 and 4 and 5 years to get something accomplished. You've got to be opportunistic when those opportunities are there, you've got to strike and you've got to take advantage of them. So I'm not sure that anything would drastically change our outlook and our strategy at this point. I think we've had a fair amount of success, I think you'd agree with that. What we've done, it's worked, and we've continued to put ourselves in a good position to take share and honestly, I don't see that changing. If we were at 30% share, something crazy, but we're still at a 12% market share. So we think there's still a lot of upside for growth from our standpoint. And again, I think it's critical that we take advantage when that opportunity provides. \nAdam Satterfield: Just to add a little bit more color to that, too, and reinforce the point. If we had not made the decisions to invest in 2016, we wouldn't have been able to take advantage of the revenue opportunities that we had in '17 and '18. And the same is true in 2019. If we had listened to everything that we had read at that point and had pulled back and not continued to execute on our CapEx plan, then we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the growth that we saw last year and what we're seeing today. So it takes investment during those slower times to kind of build up that excess capacity to be able to participate in these really strong market environments.\n And I think that's why you've seen us have a little different performance. It's a different strategy. But certainly, we've been able to participate on the upside the market swing more so than anyone. So as Greg said, we feel like we've got a really long runway for growth ahead of us, and it's just going to continue to take that continuous investment cycle whether we're in the middle of a market upturn or if things are slower, that's just something we've got to maintain our focus on and make sure that we're continuing to expand the network overall. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. \nPatrick Brown: So we've talked to some developers and it sounds like labor, materials, a difficult zoning environment is actually capping some square footage growth in the broader industrial real estate market. Obviously, you earmarked $300 million in CapEx on real estate. But Greg, you kind of talked about it, but how confident are you that you will actually be able to spend that this year? \nGreg Gantt: Well, I'll be honest with you, Tyler. I'm maybe a little more concerned. We're going to have opportunities and exceed that number. But we'll just have to see. We've got an awful lot of projects in play. So we'll just have to see what opportunities present themselves. And I can tell you at the price of land nowadays that we can reach that budget pretty darn real quick. So it's a challenge, but I think we'll get there, honestly. I think we'll be all over it. \nPatrick Brown: Okay. So that actually kind of plays into my second question. It's a difficult question, but I think it's a really important one. But how much would you say the cost to build a like-for-like door today is versus pre-COVID? I mean, how much has that increased just with all the material cost increase? Just anything directionally would be helpful. \nGreg Gantt: Yes. It's relatively significant. I'm not talking about properties now. I'm just talking about materials, I did see something from our real estate folks recently. And it's probably in the 20% range, give or take, some materials or more than that, some less, but the cost of everything, be it concrete, steel, any and all materials has definitely increased relatively significant in the last year to since the pandemic. Everything is up there. \nPatrick Brown: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, Adam, a quick question, just a clarification. So does the propane that your forklifts consume qualify for CNG tax credits? And if so, didn't those credits go away year-over-year? And was that an OR drag in Q1? Or is that not material? \nAdam Satterfield: You're very perceptive asking something like that, but that credit did go away. That credit has sort of come and gone at different times. But at this point, I think it's gone. We'll see if it comes back or not. \nOperator: And the next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Matt on for Bruce. Congrats on the quarter. With respect to China's COVID lockdowns and potential for some increased port congestion later this summer, given some CBA negotiations, we were curious if you guys are seeing any customer change in their ordering or perhaps contracting patterns in order to maybe get in front of this? \nGreg Gantt: Yes, Bruce, I can't comment on that. I have not heard that. I expect that will be an issue if it continues. But yes, what we're hearing from over there, it's not good, and it's a locked down Beijing and as long as well as the rest of the port cities that they have already, it's definitely going to be an impact, but I have not heard that, not from our sales folks or our customers to this point. \nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. I would like to turn the floor over to Greg Gantt for any closing comments. \nGreg Gantt: Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and I hope you have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Greg Gantt",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team successfully launched another year by delivering first quarter results that included new company records for both revenue and earnings per diluted share. We began the year with significant momentum in our business and expected that we would continue to win market share in 2022.\n This expectation has already become reality, as the 32.9% increase in revenue was the fifth straight quarter where we recorded double-digit revenue growth. We also improved our operating ratio to a first quarter company record of 72.9%, which drove our seventh straight quarter of double-digit growth in earnings per diluted share. Our revenue growth for the quarter included a 17.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 12% increase in LTL tons per day. The improvements in both freight density and yield created operating leverage that allowed us to improve our cost categories as a percent of revenue which also drove the improvement in our operating ratio.\n Density and yield are the key ingredients to long-term improvement in our operating ratio and both generally require the support of a favorable domestic economy. We expect to further improve each of these 2 elements as we work through 2022. Demand for our superior service has remained consistently strong, and we do not see that changing in the foreseeable future based on recent conversations with both our customers and our sales team.\n We continue to receive feedback regarding the general lack of capacity within the LTL industry. This feedback is not unexpected, given that the LTL industry has seen a net decrease in the number of service centers over the past 10 years, at least for the public group, excluding OD. Customers also appear to be dealing with lower inventory balances than they would prefer, which can result in missed revenue opportunities for them. We have unfortunately heard similar stories from our suppliers and have seen little improvement with their inventories this year. We believe these issues are driving many new customers and increased shipments from existing customers to OD.\n Despite all of the general industry and supply chain challenges, Old Dominion has continued to maintain our service center capacity to support our customers' growth. This has been and remains an integral piece of our value proposition, and we are well positioned to benefit from the continued strength in demand for both our superior service performance and network capacity.\n We have opened 3 new service centers this year and currently have approximately 15% to 20% excess capacity. These additions were part of our 2022 expansion plan that targets an additional 5 to 7 new facilities this year. While our service center network is in good shape, we are continuing to work on the other 2 pieces of the overall capacity equation. We increased our average number of full-time employees by 18.5% during the first quarter, and we expect to continue hiring additional employees during the second quarter to support our anticipated growth.\n As the capacity of the OD team increases, we would like to reduce our reliance on purchased transportation. To accomplish this, however, we will need to increase the capacity of our fleet. While our 2022 capital expenditure plan includes approximately $485 million for equipment. We are experiencing delays with the delivery of new equipment. These delays were anticipated and limit our ability to effectively match the receipt of new equipment with the expected seasonal increase in our volumes. As a result, and similar to 2021, we will operate existing equipment that would have otherwise been replaced and use purchased transportation as needed to support our growth.\n As part of our effort to deliver best-in-class service for our customers, we remain committed to ensuring that each element of capacity is in place to support our ability to win long-term market share. As we continue to manage through the short-term challenges within the current freight market. We will also maintain our focus on long-term opportunities for our business by continuing to execute on our long-term strategic plan. This plan has helped us achieve a 10-year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of approximately 11% and 24%, respectively.\n As part of this plan, we have consistently invested significant resources to support the doubling of our market share over the past 10 years. This has included a significant investment in our OD family of employees to help ensure that each employee is motivated and rewarded for providing superior service to our customers. We believe that consistently providing customers with superior service at a fair price and regularly investing in our people, equipment and network capacity to stay ahead of anticipated volume growth will support our long-term growth initiatives. As a result, we are confident in our ability to continue to produce further profitable growth and increased shareholder value.\n Thanks for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Yes. I'm not sure it's going to get a whole lot better. I mean, the equipment that we had planned to receive this year was planned to be delivered later in the year than we would normally take it. Typically, we would start taking trucks, especially late in the first quarter on through the early fall. And then the delivery would pretty much -- deliveries would pretty much be over. We would have what we had purchased for that calendar -- particular calendar year. And this year, it's just -- it's a lighter build from the get-go. That's what we were told. So that's the difference. It's just coming a little bit later. We're getting a little bit less than we had hoped to get, and we're getting a little -- getting it later. Jordan, we've done this in the past. I mean, I don't think anybody likes to manage through a downturn or a recession or whatever you want to call it, but we've done it in the past. It's surely not a lot of fun and you have to make hard decisions at times. But we've managed through the worst recession ever in 2009, at least in my pretty lengthy career, it's probably the worst ever. We managed through that fairly well. Then we did it again in '16 and through a flat year in '19. So we've geared up, then we've geared down and gear back up and this business is up and down. It always has been. But if we have to manage in a downturn, I've got all the confidence in the world we can manage through that.\n As Adam mentioned, though, so far, so good this year, our trends are good. Our feedback from customers are -- is very strong. We've had 2 of our top 10 accounts in the building in the last couple of weeks. And they're both very positive on their business and their customers and these were logistics companies, by the way. They're huge, and they manage an awful lot of dollars. And their outlook is very strong at this point in time. I think our standing with these particular accounts and with our accounts in general, our standing is better than ever. And at this point in time, we're not thinking about a downturn. If we have to, we will. But that's not where we are today. Yes. Todd, I think we are -- we -- I think we have pretty much caught up. We still have some needs in some places, but we're much closer than we've been probably in the best shape we've been in over a year. So happy with that, happy with where we are. And we'll just have to see how the volume trends continue. If we continue on our current growth trajectory, then we will have to continue to add some as our seasonality dictates, but I think those needs will be fewer certainly than they were in the last year or so. But yes, we're in a better spot and feel pretty good about our standing today. And that wouldn't be a bad thing to see that continue to level off a little bit. Todd, not that I know of, not at all. I think it's just continued growth from existing accounts. Certainly, we continue to take on new business. We have a very significant group of sales folks working out there every day. So we do continue to gain some new business from the reports that I'm seeing, but no normal growth from existing customers. I think just the continued confidence that they have in us and the service performance that we've given in the past and they like it. Their customers need that. Their supply chains, as Adam mentioned, supply chains are challenged and putting that product on the shelf more important now than probably ever. Yes. Bascome, if -- again, a big if, and I know it's a hypothetical, but if we saw a major downturn of some kind, and all of a sudden, we had excessive capacity, maybe we would look to do something different. But to tell you the truth, as Adam mentioned earlier, sometimes in a downturn, it provides the best opportunity for you to go out and do some things in certain markets that are extremely difficult to get them done. And that maps an opportunity for us and give us that very, very difficult place that we desperately need.\n So I hate to talk too much about hypotheticals, but we'll certainly take advantage of the market if it provides some opportunities for us. We've got to be opportunistic. I've talked about it in the past, how difficult it is now to acquire land in certain parts of the country, how difficult it is to get building started and whatnot. And I think we'd be terribly remiss if we sat back and said all things that really slowed down, and we shouldn't do this.\n And if you can flip the switch and build a facility in 6 months or even a year, that's one thing. But when we know in some of these markets, it's 2, 3 and 4 and 5 years to get something accomplished. You've got to be opportunistic when those opportunities are there, you've got to strike and you've got to take advantage of them. So I'm not sure that anything would drastically change our outlook and our strategy at this point. I think we've had a fair amount of success, I think you'd agree with that. What we've done, it's worked, and we've continued to put ourselves in a good position to take share and honestly, I don't see that changing.

And again, I think it's critical that we take advantage when that opportunity provides. Well, I'll be honest with you, Tyler. I'm maybe a little more concerned. We're going to have opportunities and exceed that number. But we'll just have to see. We've got an awful lot of projects in play. So we'll just have to see what opportunities present themselves. And I can tell you at the price of land nowadays that we can reach that budget pretty darn real quick. So it's a challenge, but I think we'll get there, honestly. I think we'll be all over it. Yes. It's relatively significant. I'm not talking about properties now. I'm just talking about materials, I did see something from our real estate folks recently. And it's probably in the 20% range, give or take, some materials or more than that, some less, but the cost of everything, be it concrete, steel, any and all materials has definitely increased relatively significant in the last year to since the pandemic. Everything is up there. Yes, Bruce, I can't comment on that. I have not heard that. I expect that will be an issue if it continues. But yes, what we're hearing from over there, it's not good, and it's a locked down Beijing and as long as well as the rest of the port cities that they have already, it's definitely going to be an impact, but I have not heard that, not from our sales folks or our customers to this point.

            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2022 increased 32.9% to a company record of $1.5 billion. While our operating ratio improved 320 basis points to 72.9%. The combination of these factors resulted in a 52.9% increase in earnings per diluted share to $2.60 for the quarter. Our revenue per day increased 30.8% as the first quarter of this year included one extra work day. This growth was balanced between increases in our volumes and yield, both of which continue to be supported by a favorable domestic economy.\n We continue to win a significant amount of market share as demand for our superior service and available network capacity to remain consistently strong during the quarter. As a result, the year-over-year growth in our revenue and volumes continued to trend above our longer-term averages. LTL tons per day increased 12% and our LTL revenue per hundredweight increased 17.4%. While changes in our freight mix contributed to the increases in this yield metric, the 10% increase in our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, reflects the success of our long-term pricing strategy. Our consistent strategy is designed to offset cost inflation, while also supporting further investments in capacity by focusing on the individual profitability of each customer account.\n On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter increased 1.2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. With LTL tons per day decreasing 1.4% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 2.2%. Our revenue per day performance during the first quarter, both with and without fuel surcharges, exceeded our 10-year average sequential trends, although our volumes were below our 10-year trends. It is important to remember, however, that our 10-year average trends include the doubling of our market share. As a result, there may be quarterly periods where sequential performance may be below our 10-year trends despite solid year-over-year performance. The first quarter is a good example as we believe we won a significant amount of market share and produced solid profitable growth as a result.\n The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January decreased 5.8% as compared with December, February increased 5.1% versus January, and March increased 3.6% as compared to February. The 10-year average change for the respective months are an increase of 1.6% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.6% in March.\n While there are still a few work days that remain in April, our revenue growth continues to be very strong and reflects the favorable demand environment described earlier by Greg. Our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 28% when compared to April of 2021. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q.\n Our first quarter operating ratio improved to 72.9%, with improvements in both our direct operating costs and overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Within our direct operating costs, improvement in our salaries, wages and benefit costs as a percent of revenue effectively offset the increase in expenses for both our operating supplies and purchase transportation. The increase in operating supplies and expenses as a percent of revenue was primarily due to the increase in the cost of diesel fuel and other petroleum-based products.\n We improved overhead cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter, primarily by leveraging our revenue growth and controlling discretionary spending. As mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we expect our core inflation, excluding fuel, to be between 4.5% to 5% for the year, with higher inflation in the first half of the year that is expected to moderate in the back half. We believe our fuel surcharge program is effectively offsetting the increased cost of our fuel and our yield management strategy is effectively offsetting cost increases in other areas. As we continue to experience cost increases related to our real estate network as well as with our equipment, parts and repairs, it will be critical to maintain our focus on productivity while continuing to control discretionary spending to minimize the overall effect on our cost per shipment.\n Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $388.7 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $93.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be approximately $825 million this year, which includes $300 million to expand the capacity of our service center network. We utilized $438.4 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $34.2 million in dividends during the first quarter. The total amount for share repurchases includes a $400 million accelerated share repurchase agreement that was executed during the first quarter.\n Our effective tax rate was 26.0% for the first quarter of 2022 and 2021. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 26.0% for the second quarter 2022.\n This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Well, I think that certainly, some of the quarters, those trends are very consistent. We've talked before about the first quarter and the fourth quarters can be a little bit more movement versus the average, just given the variability at times with revenue trends in those periods and certain costs that trend in various ways in those periods as well. But I think we've certainly performed very well the last couple of years and produced a lot of operating ratio improvement.\n I think regardless of the seasonal sequential changes from quarter-to-quarter, we always talk about the -- over the long term that we generally expect we've seen and would expect to continue to see 100 to 150 basis points of operating ratio improvement. And a lot of that gets back to our focus with our pricing philosophy. We try to achieve revenue per shipment growth of 100 to 150 basis points above our cost per shipment inflation. And when you look over the last 10, 15 years, including fuel in both of those metrics, that's what we've been able to achieve.\n So certainly, some years when we've got significant revenue growth like we saw last year and certainly, in the environment that we're in right now, where we're growing revenue at about 30% in the first quarter, a little over that. Certainly, it's a good environment to keep driving improvement in the operating ratio maybe above those longer-term averages. But over time, that's certainly part of the focus is to continue with that same type of mentality with our yield management philosophy. Yes. It's, I mean, a continuation of strong revenue growth, 28% is about where we are. Continuing to see strong yield performance, which that has certainly continued throughout the first quarter and same types of trends into April for sure. So it's a reflection of our ability to continue to win market share. We talked about it earlier that, as we continue to have conversations with our customers and with our sales team. We continue to get positive feedback as it relates to demand for our service. And many of these conversations center on the lack of general capacity within LTL and LTL is different from truckload.\n And I think a lot of shippers have seen the value of LTL. And certainly, the e-commerce effect on supply chains, there's been movement of freight within LTL that we believe will stay, and we believe we'll continue to see tailwinds on over time for the industry, and we think we can be the biggest participant in winning share as that industry continues to grow, much like we've been the biggest share win over the last 10 years.\n So certainly, that's our plan is to keep investing ahead of growth and keep delivering service value that's better than anyone else in our industry. We've got an unmatched value proposition and our customers continue to respond to that. And so that will be our focus, is to continue delivering best-in-class service and making sure we've got the capacity to support our customers' growth. Sure. Certainly, in the first quarter, when you look at some of the sequential changes that we had from 4Q. We outperformed what the normal seasonality was and what we had talked about our target was going to be coming into the fourth quarter -- or first quarter, rather, from the fourth. And some of the benefits that we saw really a variance from the 10-year trend were in our miscellaneous expenses. Those costs were lower. Those normally are about 0.5%. They were lower and we got some benefit, normally see an increase. They are general supplies and expenses, also were favorable to our longer-term trend.\n And some of those reflect control over discretionary spending like we talked about. And then some other things, were just -- there's times where you get some favorability and especially on those miscellanies expenses and other times where it could go the other way. It's usually 0.5% plus or minus. So we'd expect some of these items that potentially could increase.\n And I would just say, if you kind of go back to the fourth quarter and look at seasonality from fourth to first and then second, that would have put our operating ratio just above a 70%. But I can tell you, we'd be pleased with that, but we're really focused on being able to see an OR that starts with a 6. So anything that starts with a 6 is going to be good by us. Are you talking about the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses? Well, like I said, miscellaneous generally is around 0.5%, and it was at 0.2% of revenue in the first quarter. So we would expect that to move back to where it's historically trended now again. It's not to say that some of the favorable trends that we saw in the first quarter couldn't repeat. There's a lot of elements that go into that miscellaneous expense. But it's more normalized around that 0.5%. And then certainly, in some of the things in the general supplies and expenses we could continue to see some increases there as well. But no specific guidance, if you will, to say what that's going to be, but it wouldn't be unexpected to see that increase, if you will. Well, certainly, that's our expectation is to continue to produce growth. And the piece of the capacity equation that you always have to look at is on the service center side. It takes doors to process freight within LTL. And so that is the more determinant figure in terms of how much from the levels where we currently are that we can continue to grow. And we generally like to have somewhere 20% to 25% excess capacity. So our CapEx plan this year includes about $300 million to further expand the capacity of our overall service center network. We've opened the 3 facilities so far this year, and we've got more that are slated as we proceed through the year to keep expanding the number of service centers and some of those dollars are increasing doors at existing locations as well.\n Now when it comes to the people side of the equation and the fleet, much like you've seen in our numbers over the last couple of years, the lever that we pull there is we have to use purchased transportation if we need to supplement one or the other of those pieces of the capacity equation. Certainly, we've stepped up the increased use of purchased transportation. We were actually pleased to see that the outsourced miles that we had in the first quarter have actually trended down versus where we were in just the fourth quarter of last year. So we're continuing to make progress there as we continue to add people to our OD family. We had an 18.5% increase in the number of full-time employees. So we're continuing to be successful there and attracting new people to our business and retaining those that we already have. And then we're continuing to balance the capacity of our fleet.\n As Greg mentioned in prepared comments, there's multiple ways to do that. We're having to hang on to some of the older equipment. We will get some relief later in the year we hope, with deliveries of what's been ordered, if you will. But again, we can use purchased transportation as needed to supplement there. So I think we've got those pieces covered, and we're continuing to give 99% on-time service performance with the claims ratio between 0.1% and 0.2%. So it's best-in-class service despite the significant volume of growth and processing significant growth on top of the growth that we had last year. Yes. Certainly, the increases that we need in the first half of this year are going to be higher, just like we talked about the expectations on our inflation. We started seeing really the inflation pick up in the middle of last year. And so as contracts were maturing in, we were having to start asking for more. We look at the current environment as those mature and what we're seeing and what we expect. And we're always making predictions for multiple things, what our volumes are going to be, as well as our cost and what our customer needs are, but certainly started seeing acceleration in some of those renewals in the back half of last year, and those need to continue as we move through the first half.\n But we are starting to get some normalization on some of the weight per shipment trends. At this point, our weight per shipment is flat with where we were last year. We've seen a decreased weight per shipment over the last year or so as well as an increase in the length of haul. So both of those changes in mix have been supporting that overall reported yield number, and making it look stronger than just the core increases that we're getting.\n But we continue to target cost plus. That's been our long-term pricing philosophy. It's been consistent and one of our customers know and can understand and we'll continue to execute on that same type of philosophy as we progress through the year. But with some of those mix metrics normalizing, when you just look at kind of normalized trends, it would -- if you look at kind of normal seasonality, if you will, just sequential increases from this point forward, it starts coming down. The year-over-year starts getting to the higher single digits to kind of mid-single digits and eventually normalizing, if you will. But certainly, right now, we're able to get increases that are covering our cost inflation, and I think you can see that in our numbers. Well, right now, like I said, we're flat. So as we progress through the second quarter, then we could. If things just sort of hold steady, if you will, from a mix standpoint, then certainly, we would start seeing some increase, and that's kind of the point of you might start seeing the reverse of what we did last year, where the mix change puts a little bit of pressure on that reported revenue per hundredweight.\n Certainly, in the third quarter, that was our low watermark. I think we were at 1,538 pounds on average in the third quarter of last year. Right now, we're trending somewhere in the 1,575, so between 1,550, and 1,600 pounds, but it's been a little bit heavier on that scale over the last few months. All right. I'll try to clarify that first. I'll just talk about our revenue growth, and we don't want to necessarily give the details. We'll wait unless the month settle out. But like I kind of referenced earlier, in March, we saw revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel, that was up about 9%. And that's about the same year-over-year change that we're seeing.\n From fuel, we never really get into the breaking down fuel contributions, but the average price per gallon in March is about the same in April. And so it's averaging about a little over 5 -- about $5.11, $5.12. So there's about a 62% increase in that DOE price per gallon in March, and the same type of increase that we're seeing in April. So we'll have similar contributions, if you will, there. So the overall yield continues to show considerable strength and the comparisons start looking a little bit different, if you will, on the volume side.\n And when you look at last year and what the revenue growth was, we had total revenue growth of about 16% in the first quarter of last year, and it was 47% in the second quarter. So those will certainly change as we progress through the second quarter, the comparisons get a little bit tougher. Which is why we're extremely pleased to see the strong revenue growth at 28% in April. But you'll continue to see contributions like that. The yield is certainly driving a lot of that revenue growth for us right now, but seeing very solid volume performance as well.\n In terms of the operating ratio, don't want to give specific guidance per se, but my point was we certainly had some favorability in the first quarter. I mentioned the general supplies and expenses and the miscellaneous expenses and that those could revert back. So there certainly could be some pressure on that normal sequential change that we see from the first to second quarter. One other thing that was beneficial was we had lower fringe costs in the first quarter than what I expected for the year, and that's fringe cost as a percent of our salaries and wages. So I would expect that to kind of normalize back to where I thought it would be for the year. So there may be a little bit of pressure on a couple of those items. Time will tell and we'll see.\n But my point was if you just took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter, certainly, we had big outperformance in 1Q. But if you took normal seasonality from the fourth quarter and ran it through to the second, that would have put our operating ratio right in a 70.2%. And we'll see that would imply less seasonal improvement than what we normally expect. And what the point of the matter was if we operate anywhere that starts with a 6, it fits a 69.9%, we will certainly be very excited to see that kind of number.\n We're sitting here like Burt Reynolds and Jerry Reed trying to do something that they said couldn't be done. And we think that we can get it done. But certainly, if it comes out that it's about 70.1% or 70.2% that's producing very strong profitable growth as well. But nevertheless, not throwing necessarily a specific target out there, but just saying what could be done with some of the numbers and how they might normally train it. Well, from a tonnage standpoint, that was the point we wanted to make was that what's going on in truckload right now. We are already last year, had taken a lot of the heavier weighted shipments that might be considered spillover freight in prior periods and had worked those out of our systems. So we don't have those same pressures, and I don't think many of the other LTL carriers do either, just looking at some of the statistics. I think freight demand had been so solid and influx of freight into the LTL world that many carriers and certainly, us, we can speak to specifically, were just focused on long-term LTL freight, not something that might be more transactional here today going tomorrow type of thing if truckload capacity loosened up.\n So we're not seeing the same type of pressures and not really hearing about it from an overall competitive landscape either, that there's some movement of freight going back into the truckload world. But certainly something that we'll continue to pay attention to, and we're talking very frequently with customers and our sales team. But again, that's consistent feedback that we're receiving from all parties is that demand continues to be solid.\n And certainly, numbers are what they are and part of the conversation in our prepared remarks talking about 10-year trends and so forth, we've doubled our market share over the last 10 years. And that doesn't always come in a linear fashion. So we might have a month where volumes underperform for a monthly period, our 10-year average trends, and that's just certainly not something to get overly concerned about. And we saw some of that in the first quarter. We underperformed, if you just look purely from a 10-year average sequential standpoint, on the volume side, but we produced a lot of revenue growth and good profit growth as a result.\n So we continue to be encouraged by the overall environment, and the feedback that we're hearing from customers and our sales team and want to continue to do what it takes to take advantage of the volume flows that may come our way this year. Well, I mean, I think you've got to look at past performance to a degree to see how we react. And as Greg mentioned earlier, we've taken the opportunity in the past and some of those slower periods like you mentioned, to, in some ways, accelerate our investments. And I mentioned earlier that we're probably a little bit behind. We're at 15% to 20% excess capacity. We like being at sort of 20% to 25% on average. And we're a little behind that target range is given the significant volume growth that we've had.\n So we look through a longer-term wins, if you will, and try to project out where we think our market share and our volumes might be in the next 5 to 10 years. It's not just always in the here and now because certainly, you can't execute when it comes to real estate investments in a very short period of time. Oftentimes, and we didn't necessarily see this in the last slow cycle in '19 like we thought we might have, but in prior periods in downturns, we've seen some opportunities come our way that were attractive investments from land opportunities, existing service center opportunities. So certainly, if something becomes available in an area that's on our long-term road map for where we want to go, then yes, we would take advantage of something like that.\n But it's just always sort of looking at what's in front of you, if you will, from an opportunity standpoint and then us thinking about the longer-term opportunity where we want to be, where we think we need to have capacity to support the continued growth within our network and to be able to keep our service metrics where they are today. Well, we certainly have one, we've just recently disclosed our first ESG sustainability report. So we were proud to get that out. And I think that was a means to show some of the long-term improvements that we've made over time with operating efficiencies and overall improvements in our miles per gallon and so forth, and we'll continue to track towards some of the goals that we have internally to continue to improve those metrics. And one of the key pillars of our foundation for success is continuous improvement, and that means multiple things, continuous improvement in multiple areas.\n But as it relates specifically to electric vehicles and autonomous and so forth, we'll continue to stay engaged with manufacturers to see what's coming down the line. We would like to try to test some of the equipment, and we actually ordered some equipment, but we're still waiting on the delivery of the truck. And so I think that goes to some of the pressures that the OEMs have in terms of what actually is being produced and is planned to be produced in the near-term. We're still from all the feedback we get from specs and capabilities, don't believe that electric trucks as they exist today, really fit the operating model of an LTL network, at least how we run our business.\n But we felt like we wanted to have a seat at the table and that was why we put an order in to get something and actually put it in place to operate and to be able to give true feedback in terms of what the limitations may or may not be. So -- but we'll continue to stay engaged with all of our suppliers in that regard to see as things change and where it may make sense to try to integrate some of that technology into our network as it makes sense or not. No, we haven't provided the detail. Consistent with what we've done in the past, we'll give it with our 10-Q, but just gave where we're trending from an overall revenue standpoint and then gave a little extra color on kind of what our yield trends are doing. Well, I certainly think it's been more disciplined, and you can go back to 2019 and in particular, the second quarter of 2020 as well. I mean, that was a pretty steep drop for everyone from a revenue standpoint. And no one knew how long of a drop we were going to be in. But I think that there was a lot of discipline that was shown. And I think it gets back to -- there's certainly a lot of value that an LTL carrier can offer and there's a lot of expense to running and to expanding an LTL carrier's network. And we certainly have seen that over the years.\n We talk a lot about the cost of expanding our real estate network, the land cost facilities where we have to lease some of the rent rates have almost become prohibitively expensive, but something I thought that way about a couple of years ago may now look like a bargain. So it's one of those things where we've got to continue to build that type of cost escalation into our pricing plans. And I think we'll continue to certainly see our numbers and our philosophy, no change with respect to the cost plus pricing that we've displayed over the years.\n And I think that it's likely that we'll continue to -- we've seen discipline from the other carriers and wouldn't expect any change in that regard. And the industry now, I mean a lot has certainly been written lately about what's going on in truckload. But you've got almost 70% of the LTL revenue that's in publicly-traded companies now. And so it doesn't take long to see what everyone is seeing and doing and certainly, probably more important to see what actually is going on for management teams versus just reading reports off of the Internet that's sensationalized, maybe a little bit more. But I don't think you can all necessarily extrapolate what you're seeing in some of those reports to the LTL world. Yes. Certainly, we were able to use the purchased transportation in an increasing manner as we went through mainly 2021, started stepping it up a little bit in response to the acceleration in volumes that we saw in the back half of 2020. And I'm speaking of the sequential acceleration just to be able to keep pace with the growth and expectations from our customers. But we've got good carriers that we've used to supplement mainly within our line-haul operation. And it's overall still pretty minimal in terms of the outsourced miles.\n Certainly, we saw the cost increasing, if you will, as that rate environment was increasing. But we were able to work those third parties into our network and keep our service metrics high, while responding to significant volume growth from customers last year. And we saw maybe a slight uptick in our claims ratio. That was probably more or somewhat reflective of using third-party truckload carriers versus our 20- and 28-foot pup operation and all the claims prevention tools that we have.\n But when I say it uptick-ed, it uptick-ed from 0.1% something to 0.16% that just rounded to 0.2%. So we're talking very minimal increase there. And that's part of the overall value that we provide to our customers. And Greg mentioned it earlier in his prepared comments that part of our value proposition is having capacity. When you look through prior cycles, look through 2017 and 2018, we were able to grow with our customers right now. And when you look at the other carriers, at least public carriers in the back half of last year were pretty flattish from a volume standpoint.\n So we're able to come in and demonstrate value, not only with the service quality that we offer but being able to provide capacity when no one else can. And so that takes investment. It takes investment in the real estate of fleet and our people. to make sure we've got that flex capacity. And certainly, we always try to stay ahead of the game as best we can in that regard, but certainly pleased that we're able to deliver that for our customers. Well, we've talked about this before, but in our business, the way we try to manage and project out, we always have a baseline forecast for the year. And then we have scenarios with growth above that baseline and scenarios where the volumes are below that baseline, and we try to have a plan for both. We have that baseline plan and then how we're going to execute in either side of that scenario. And all we can do is continuously look at our numbers and have continuous conversations with customers. And certainly, we've had years where we've been above and below our baseline scenarios and you just make operational decisions from that point forward.\n And part of that is the way we structure our network. We give -- each of our service center managers has got control in terms of managing their headcount and running their operation as needed in terms of adding to or are pulling back on some of the additions that they're making depending on what the environment is like and -- but it just takes constant communication between us and our customer base. And oftentimes, a lot of that is communication with many of our third-party logistics customers, 6 of our top 10 largest customers are 3PLs, and they're a fair amount of our overall business, and they generally have a read on what's going on and if there's mode shift and other things. And we still get favorable feedback from them with respect to the expectations for volumes this year. And so that kind of goes into our baseline and maybe why some of our conversation and thinking might seem a little bit different than what others might be talking about with respect to overall transportation this year. Yes, we do. I feel like it will continue to grow. And right now, we've got -- when you look at all the industrial numbers, those are all favorable for sure, and we're seeing good growth. Our revenue growth in the first quarter was pretty balanced between both our industrial and our retail-related business. We're continuing to see consumer spending. But irrespective of that, there's freight demand for LTL carriers and shippers that this e-commerce effect on supply chains that are leveraging the network that we've built out in moving freight if it's a manufacturer that is moving freight.\n In yesteryear, it may have been one full truckload of goods to a regional distribution center that may be 10 different fulfillment centers in that same region. And we can fill one truckload basically, one full van of goods at that same manufacturer. But they're now leveraging our network as we distribute those goods throughout our system and to that ultimate fulfillment center.\n And so we think that type of change will continue to drive volumes into the LTL industry. And I think that given the investments that we've made and the requirements too, from the big box retailers for their vendors shipping product in, most have on-time-in-full or must-arrive-by-date type of programs. And certainly, it's a focus on the on-time deliveries and no damages. And when you've got the best metrics like we do, that's how we can add further value to our customers by making sure that they show well on their vendor scorecards with their customers. And that's been a piece of the market share that we've won over the last 10 years, and we think that, that trend will continue going forward. I mean, it's still more weighted to industrial than retail. About 55% to 60% of our revenue is industrial related and 25% to 30% is retail related, but it's -- that's probably moved up the spectrum closer to that 30% threshold. And I mentioned that we've seen a lot of good growth in our -- with our retail customers and we have. I mean, that's been a big part of the story. But we continue to see good growth in market share with our industrial customers as well. And there have been periods where that retail was growing a bit faster, but both are growing for us, and we're still seeing good share there. So it's -- that retail component has crept up a little bit, but our good industrial business has grown as well and has continued to somewhat keep pace. No. It's -- we look at the inventory to sales ratio, and that continues to be low and really reconciles the feedback that we're getting from customers, be it on the retail or the industrial side that inventory balances are lower than what they prefer them to be. We have an awful lot of conversation about the number of back orders that many are dealing with, and in some cases, missed opportunities where they simply haven't had product on the shelf for ready now if it's a online purchase, if you will. And so I think that's something that Greg mentioned earlier that we're seeing and hearing not only from the customer side, but we're seeing it and feeling it from our supplier side as well.\n So both kind of go hand in hand and many of our suppliers are also customers. So we're seeing that across the board, if you will. But that's why we think that even -- I mean right now, consumer spending continues to be strong. I think household balance sheets are good and maybe consumer confidence is not as high as it has been. But we still feel like freight demand can continue for past any type of consumption slowdown just given the fact that we feel like inventory balances need to be built back up. And we continue to believe that long term, we'll see a higher inventory to sales ratio than perhaps where we were, pre-pandemic. Just to add a little bit more color to that, too, and reinforce the point. If we had not made the decisions to invest in 2016, we wouldn't have been able to take advantage of the revenue opportunities that we had in '17 and '18. And the same is true in 2019. If we had listened to everything that we had read at that point and had pulled back and not continued to execute on our CapEx plan, then we wouldn't have been able to enjoy the growth that we saw last year and what we're seeing today. So it takes investment during those slower times to kind of build up that excess capacity to be able to participate in these really strong market environments.\n And I think that's why you've seen us have a little different performance. It's a different strategy. But certainly, we've been able to participate on the upside the market swing more so than anyone. So as Greg said, we feel like we've got a really long runway for growth ahead of us, and it's just going to continue to take that continuous investment cycle whether we're in the middle of a market upturn or if things are slower, that's just something we've got to maintain our focus on and make sure that we're continuing to expand the network overall. You're very perceptive asking something like that, but that credit did go away. That credit has sort of come and gone at different times. But at this point, I think it's gone. We'll see if it comes back or not."

Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Freeman: Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's fourth quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy, which is similar to how the economic environment fell throughout much of 2023. As a result, the rebound in volumes that we had anticipated back in the spring never fully materialized. Despite the softness in the economy and weaker-than-expected volumes, the OD team faithfully executed on the same long-term strategic plan that has guided us through the ups and downs of the economic cycle many times before. During the fourth quarter, our LTL tons per day decreased 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Although our LTL shipments per day and overall market share improved, we also improved the quality of our revenue during the quarter as well, which contributed to an increase in both our quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share for the first time in 2023. We believe that underlying demand for our LTL service remained consistent in the quarter, which corresponds to the consistency in our volume trends. The stability of our volumes also reflects our ongoing ability to deliver best-in-class value proposition. We were pleased to provide an on-time service performance of 99%, and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the quarter, which also supported the ongoing execution of our yield management initiatives. We have said many times before that long-term improvement in our operating ratio is dependent upon a consistent improvement in density and yield, both of which generally require the support of a positive macro environment. While our network density was challenged this year, we improved our yield by maintaining our consistent cost-based approach to our pricing. This approach focuses on improving the profitability of each customer through yield increases that are designed to offset our cost inflation and support further investments in capacity and technology. We continue to invest significantly during the 2023, as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our capital expenditures totaled $757.3 million for the year, of which $291.1 million was spent for the ongoing expansion of our service center network. We opened two new service centers in 2023 and have several others under construction and nearly complete that could be opened quickly once the demand environment improves. Our team knows firsthand how quickly the demand environment can change in the LTL industry, and we are very experienced at growing our company without sacrificing the quality of our service. To do so, however, requires us to maintain a certain amount of excess capacity in our service center network. We are pleased to currently have approximately 30% excess capacity in our network, and we have the ability to expand it further as needed to help ensure our network is never limiting factor to our growth. While the investments in our service center network, our equipment and our technology further improved the overall quality of our service in 2023, the best investment we made was in the OD Family of employees. We improved the capabilities of our team and strengthened our unique company culture, which has defined OD for many years. Our long-term strategic plan may sound simple on the surface, but no one in our industry has been able to replicate our success because they do not have our people or our culture. Our team is fully committed to our proven business model. And as a result, we believe we are strongly positioned to respond to a positive inflection in demand once the domestic economy begins to improve. We are confident in the opportunities that lie ahead, and it is our belief, our team's focus on delivering superior service at a fair price will support our ability to produce further profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. I want to thank you today for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 billion, which was a 0.3% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 3.0% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 2.0% decrease in LTL tons per day. Our quarterly operating ratio was 71.8% and earnings per diluted share were $2.94, which was a 0.7% increase from last year. As Marty previously mentioned, this was the first quarter with an increase in both revenue and earnings per diluted share since the fourth quarter of last year. While it certainly has not felt like one of our record years from the past, $2.94 also represents a new company record for fourth quarter earnings per diluted share. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 1.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.6%, and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.8% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.6% in tons per day and a decrease of 3.4% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the fourth quarter were as follows: October decreased 0.7% as compared to September, November decreased 0.6% from October and December decreased 4.8% as compared to November. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 3.5% in October, an increase of 3.5% in November and a decrease of 8.0% in December. For January, we expect our revenue per day will decrease approximately 3.1% as compared to January of 2023, with a decrease of approximately 5.1% in our LTL tons per day. These numbers could be plus or minus 10 basis points or 20 basis points, depending upon today's revenue performance. We expect our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, will increase approximately 6.4%, which is generally in line with normal seasonality for this metric. We will file the actual revenue-related details for January in our Form 10-K. Our operating ratio increased 60 basis points to 71.8% for the fourth quarter. We continued to operate efficiently during the quarter despite the lack of network density, but our direct operating costs increased as a percent of revenue. The increase in these costs was primarily due to an increase in our insurance and claims expense as a percent of revenue, which is attributable to changes in the annual adjustment we record in our fourth quarter each year relating to our third-party actuarial reviews. We were otherwise pleased with our control over direct operating costs during the quarter, as our team did a nice job of matching labor to current revenue trends. While our LTL shipments per day increased, our average headcount was down 4.1% when compared to the fourth quarter 2022. We currently believe that our workforce is appropriately sized for our current shipment trends, but we will likely need to add to our workforce this year as volumes begin to improve. Our overhead cost also increased as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to control discretionary spending. Depreciation expense as a percent of revenue increased 80 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter 2022, due primarily to the execution of our 2023 capital expenditure plan. The increases in depreciation and other overhead costs were partially offset by a 90 basis point improvement in our miscellaneous expenses as a percent of revenue, which included $15.1 million of gains on the disposal of property and equipment. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $436.7 million for the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, while capital expenditures were $105.9 million and $757.3 million for the same respective periods. We utilized $85.5 million and $453.6 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.6 million and $175.1 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 24.1% as compared to 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, team. This is Matt on for Bruce Chan. Thanks for taking our question. You've highlighted some market share gains in the past couple of quarters here post-Yellow, and wanted to get your sense of to what extent do you expect these to continue as more competitors bring on new capacity?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Certainly our long-term story has been winning market share over time, and we believe we'll continue to win market share into the future as well primarily based on the value proposition that we offer a superior service at a fair price. And as we mentioned earlier, our on-time service continued to be 99% during the quarter, and our claims ratio is at 0.1%, and that is what's driven our market share over time. Typically, when we're in a slower macro environment like we've been in, our market share tends to be flatter. But once we start seeing a recovery in the economy, that's when we think our model signs the brightest. If you look back in periods past, when the up cycle begins, that's when we've got plenty of network capacity, the job that we've done with managing our people capacity and equipment capacity as well, combining with the real estate positions us to capitalize on those upswings. And that's when in the past, we've been able to outgrow the other publicly traded peers anywhere from 600 basis points to 1,000 basis points. So we're still waiting on that positive inflection in the economy, but I feel like we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on it when the upswing begins.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for that. And as a quick follow-up, how do you see industry capacity this year versus last year? And do you have a quick view of what percentage of latent off-line capacity might return as we progress throughout this year? Thanks a lot.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that there's a lot of settling that still needs to occur post the Yellow closing their doors. But if you go back a year or more, we were a capacity constrained industry, and I feel like once all the dust settles, capacity is shifting around a bit, but will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. All of those service centers will not end up in the market, yet all of those freight shipments will be and will have to be handled by someone. So I feel like, especially once the economy recovers, we'll most likely be viewed as a capacity constrained industry once again.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Maybe I have a follow-up on that. And I would just love to get your thoughts on how the Yellow asset auctions spanned out versus your expectations? And maybe a broader question there is based on that. Do you think the next up cycle is going to play out differently with the redistribution of capacity from one entity like Yellow that was constantly seeding share over several years to a handful of entities now trying to gain share? Do you think that changes the competitor dynamics at all?\nAdam Satterfield: I don't think so. Just like I mentioned before, we've been able to win market share over the long-term based on the quality of our service, first and foremost, on the value proposition that we're offering our customers. And we believe that, that same formula will continue to win share for us, as we go forward, it takes having capacity to be able to continue to grow. And that's why we've always invested ahead of the growth curve and tried to target having about 25% excess capacity in the service center network at all times. And so right now, we mentioned that we're at about 30% excess capacity. So we're a little north of where we've historically been, but we believe it's always important to consistently invest and keep that focus on the long-term opportunities and that certainly played to our benefit in the past. And it's hard to say with the Yellow process, with their service centers. But net-net, we believe that there would be some exit of capacity, and I think that's generally what we'll end up seeing once all the dust has settled on things. And we obviously took a look at those service centers early on, didn't end up with anything. And that's why given the state of where our network is today and the opportunities that we continue to have to expand it, and we felt like just given the cost that \u2013 you can see now in hindsight that it was better for us to just maintain control, our network is in a great spot as it is, but we continue to have the ability to control when we add to the network in time, where we decide to add the facilities and how exactly we want to build them. So we felt like continuing with the same formula that's worked for so many years for us. We want to keep executing on that same business plan as we go forward.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to talk a little bit sort of near-term and get a sense of how things are progressing, I guess, first quarter. We've seen some weather here in January. I think typically, OR gets a little bit worse as we go from 4Q to 1Q, but maybe you can put some \u2013 help us a little bit. I think there were some moving parts, in particular, in the fourth quarter with the gain as well as some of the insurance actuarial stuff that was going on there. So just kind of get a sense of how you're thinking about the first quarter both from sort of an operational perspective, but also from an OR standpoint?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Winter weather comes every year, and it's something that we contend with, and is generally in our averages. So we don't view that as a one-time event. But a couple of weeks ago, us and everyone else had to deal with weather issues and made up for a little bit of lost ground with that last week. And then we've got a short week to finish out the month, the year. So we'll see where the final numbers land. But as of right now, our shipments per day are trending pretty much in line with where we thought they would be. I gave the 10-year average earlier with respect to the sequential changes from a shipments per day standpoint. Our December was 5.9% below November, that's better than the 10-year average. But over the last five years, we've kind of changed \u2013 we've given one extra day of paid time off around the holidays. And so our five-year average in December is actually a decrease of 6.5%. So we were a little bit better than that revised average that changes the month a little bit, not so much the quarter. But looking at January, the five-year average sequential change is a plus 0.3% increase, and so we'll see where we end up. But I feel like that certainly that number has been impacted a little bit, looks like it's going to come in below that overall sequential number that we would go up a bit. But how much will we get back in February, where we see kind of a traditional bump and then March will continue to be the important month. That's a month where we're typically up about 5% sequentially over February. And if you remember, we anticipated in 2023 that we would see a recovery in the spring. And unfortunately, it didn't materialize like we thought it would, but that will kind of be the key point for this quarter is will we start seeing that reacceleration in our business levels, and that obviously dictate a lot in terms of the operating ratio and general performance for the first quarter.\nChristian Wetherbee: And just one point of clarification. So for 4Q, do you think that with those two big moving parts, that's sort of the number that we have is the right jump-off number as we think about that normal sequential progression of OR?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, the normal change in OR from the fourth to the first quarter is about a 100 basis point increase, maybe 110 basis points. And those two particular items that we called out in the press release, we'd expect some normalization, if you will. To start with, the insurance and claims, that was 1.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter. That number had averaged 1.2%, 1.3% each quarter in the first three quarters of the year. And so we'd expect that to somewhat normalize and our expense to be more consistent in the first, second and third quarters of 2024. Now it maybe a little bit higher \u2013 we've had four or five straight years of double-digit premium increases and continue to contend with higher cost in that line item, but I still expect that, that would be maybe 1.3%, 1.4% of revenue in the first quarter. So get maybe 50 basis points of benefit, if you will, as we transition into the first quarter on that line item. And then the miscellaneous expenses, we wouldn't expect for those gains to be that significant. That was pretty unusual. Typically, that miscellaneous \u2013 the expense line item is 40 basis points or 50 basis points. And so we'd expect that to somewhat go back to normal as well. So that could be kind of 100 basis point, 110 basis point headwind. So I think just net-net, thinking about the 71.8 that we did in the fourth quarter, as we transition into the first, maybe 170 basis points to 220 basis points deterioration, 170 would be kind of normalizing for those items that I just mentioned. And then just maybe being on the high side of that was just the uncertainty of where we really get the economic recovery and volume performance through the quarter, that acceleration that we normally would. If we get that acceleration, we're certainly managing all of our costs, and it could be on the low end of the scale or better. But as of right now, probably better to just handicap it on the higher side of that normalized average.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Adam, just to clarify that insurance and claims that was an annual adjustment, right? So when you talk about normalizing, I just want to understand that actuarial change. But my question would be on \u2013 you didn't bid for the \u2013 or I guess, maybe win the centers, maybe your thoughts on in the industry, if you think there was \u2013 I presume you think then there was overpayment, right, given you were trying to be the stalking horse bid. So what does that mean for the environment? Do you think those peers need to get a return quickly on that investment, and you see increased pricing competition? I just want to understand your thoughts or view on what the impact of overpaying from your peers' competitive perspective means?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I won't say anybody overpaid. We looked at the whole thing, obviously, with that initial bid and felt like if we could get everything and get it at somewhat of a discounted pricing than we were willing to take that risk, and obviously, it would have come with increased cost if we had absorbed all that property. But I think each carrier is different, they look at those opportunities. And I guess that fit in with their long-term strategic plan. I think if anything, it's increased in the cost basis. And like we've said for many years, as we've invested in real estate, you've got to build that into your overall cost structure and appropriately capture that with rates. And that's been our strategy over time and it's certainly played to our advantage. So if our competitors' cost structures are increasing, I wouldn't expect that they would change their approach to pricing. But I think if anything, they've got to build it in there and try to capture for it. But fortunately, that's something that we're not having to contend with. Like I mentioned earlier, we're good with our strategy, and we feel like it's worked for us over time, and we believe that same formula and strategy can continue to work for us in the future. So that's what we're going to keep executing under.\nKen Hoexter: And I'm sorry, thanks for that. Great answer, but do you mind clarifying on the insurance?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes. You're right. We do an annual actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter each year of our reserves. And so we, unfortunately, had an unfavorable adjustment this year. And those go either way. The last few years, they've been favorable adjustments. And we've got an expense rate that we use through the first three quarters of the year, and that's why you see that number that's more consistent, if you will, but \u2013 and then we just had that third-party review done make adjustments and then just kind of move on. But just looking at that activity, that's why I think that our expense rate will be a little bit higher in 2024 through the first three quarters versus where we were last year, but maybe only 10, 20 basis points or so, and then we'll conduct another actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, make whatever adjustments are necessary then and then just move on. But I think it's been \u2013 since 2019 was last year, we had an unfavorable one. So best case scenarios when we get to the end of the year, they conduct the study, and we don't have an adjustment either way. But unfortunately, this year, it was an unfavorable one.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks for that. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey. Thanks. Adam, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that maybe there's a need to add headcount in anticipation of volume growth. Can you just put a little bit more color around that? How far ahead of this inflection of volume, when could we expect the headcount to go and how quickly? And then, the industry is always \u2013 another follow-up to that. The industry has obviously been disrupted over the last six months and the dust is settling, curious to get your view on like how you think the competitive dynamic has evolved from both a service quality perspective and a pricing perspective. Have you seen service disruptions? I know there's maybe early signs of that in the third quarter, but have those fixed itself or you continue to see services structure to create market share opportunities for you? And what are you seeing on the competitive pricing side that makes you feel better or worse or neutral about kind of where the discipline is in the industry?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. That's a lot in one question. I'll see if I can keep it all straight. But we have heard about some service issues and we obviously stay very engaged with our customer base, our large national accounts and 3PL customer accounts as well and meet with them often. And so we have heard about some service issues and believe that, that's something that may continue. And it's very typical in an up cycle, especially. And so I think some of the carriers that maybe took on some of that extra Yellow business may cause some issues for them throughout the system or their system. And so that's usually a source of market share for us especially when the economy starts to pick up. But from a pricing standpoint, it's continued to be a very favorable pricing environment, I would say. We've seen \u2013 obviously, we've continued on with our consistent and cost-based increases, and that will be our strategy going forward as well. But just looking at some of the GRIs and some of the feedback that we've had from [indiscernible] as well, it seems like the other carriers have continued to push for increases. So that's generally a good thing for us as well. If the competitors are increasing their rates. And again, increasing demand environments. Generally, we see competitors that are increasing rates faster than us. And if we're at a price premium to the market and that gap closes, that too, creates market share opportunity for us. So that's why we feel good about where we're positioned and the opportunities that we have going forward. It's been a long, slow cycle that we've been in. ISM has been below 50 for 14 months now. And you compare that to 2008, 2009, I think, was below 50 for 12 months. It's been a very long, slow cycle that we're ready to get back to growing again. But, you know, going through these slow cycles requires patience. And I think we've managed well, managed cost efficiencies, managed our discretionary spending to go through a year where tonnage was down 9%. Our operating ratio was at 72, to me was pretty remarkable. And so I'm really proud of what our team accomplished this year and what we've done to position ourselves for opportunities that are ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yeah, agreed. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Adam, thanks for the commentary around the 4Q to 1Q move in the OR, given some of the noise in the fourth quarter. As we think about the rest of the year, and I know it's difficult to predict the volume landscape, so let me frame it, if you will. It sounds like you're in a good position, 30% capacity. Maybe you can see the whites of the eyes on adding headcount, maybe both PT lever if necessary, if things kind of accelerate quicker than expected. But should we expect a return to kind of normal seasonal trends in the OR this year? Or can we see even better in the first maybe nine months, if you get some of the volume back on a stickier basis, more of an industrial recovery and then maybe lag a little bit some of the resources that you need to handle that just given your spare capacity today.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I mean, obviously, a lot of it is going to be volume dependent, and we'll really get some type of economic recovery and when does that begin? It'd be great to see it start early. But I'm not sure that the general economic forecasters are predicting that things are going to start so early in the year. But we're ready. We actually hired and increased our headcount during the fourth quarter, much of which was on the platform where we were hiring folks to backfill some of the jobs where our combo employees with the freight volumes that were higher in the second half of the year, we pulled people off the dock and put them right back into a truck, and we're driving again. So we backfilled some of those positions in particular. But we're cautiously optimistic about things, and we're not going to get ahead of it by any means. So once we start seeing line of sight into some volume recovery, and increased demand, and we'll make sure that we're adding to the workforce as appropriate to keep up with it to make sure that we're efficiently handling any growth that comes without any sacrifice to the quality of our service. But I would say that from a big picture standpoint, when you look back in time and just thinking about the fiscal year overall, generally, when we've gone through a slow period, even going back to 2009, 2016, 2019, we've gone through periods that have been really slow. If we've lost anything from an operating ratio standpoint when the volumes and revenue come back into the system, we've been able to more than recover that OR loss. And back to our cost structure and really pleased with the performance, as I said, but we generated improvement in our direct operating cost for the year this year, even despite the lack of density that we had with the volume weakness. And really, the OR loss was just limited to our overhead expenses increasing, and most of that was depreciation as we continue to expand the network as we brought in new equipment into our fleet to replace some of the older stuff that we've been hanging on to the last couple of years with OEM challenges. So as we incurred a lot of the expense on our own selectively, we're positioning ourselves to capitalize on future growth opportunities. So that will be the power of leverage in the model, is once we get that topline growth going again, we'll continue to be able to improve further those direct operating costs as a percent of revenue, but we regained lost ground on the overhead side, get right back to the operating ratio improvement and have that same formula work and where we're growing the topline, improving the operating ratio and having the income growing faster than the revenues. And that's producing profitable growth has been our long-term story, and it's led to a big increase in shareholder value over time as well.\nJonathan Chappell: Yes. Okay. Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to ask you just on pricing and I guess if we look at the January, I think you said the January is up like 6.4% and 4Q was 7.5%, I believe, for revenue per hundredweight ex-fuel. Do you think there's kind of further deceleration in the pace of year-over-year pricing that you would expect looking forward? And where do you think things settle out? Is it 4 or 5? And then I guess, just one other kind of related question. How do you think we ought to think about cost inflation this year compared to what it was last year? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes, from a \u2013 just a revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, if you apply normal seasonality quarter-by-quarter, then the yields would compress to around 6.5% growth, kind of in the first and second quarters, and then that would start to moderate to be closer to 5.5% by the fourth quarter, which \u2013 as you know, if you look long-term, our revenue per shipment has been more in the 5%, 5.5% range over time. So we'd expect, absent any mix changes for that \u2013 for us to be able to get consistent increases as we go through the year, as bids are coming new and that's why you just see that absolute number increase quarter-by-quarter. But that rate of growth may start to compress. Now granted, I had anticipated that it would compress a little bit last year and we had the decrease in weight per shipment. And so that supported some of that reported yield metric. Now the reverse could happen this year, especially as we get into the back half of the year. If the economy is improving, we'd expect weight per shipment to be higher, and that generally results in a lower revenue per hundredweight. So \u2013 but higher revenue per shipment. So it all kind of balanced out. We believe this year. That will be the more important factor, though, we feel like is will we start seeing some real growth in that revenue \u2013 or I mean, weight per shipment metric rather, that would mean that orders for our customers' products are starting to increase. There's more widgets for every shipment. And that's what we hope that we'll start seeing sometime soon here early this year. From a cost per shipment standpoint, we saw a moderation in our cost per shipment throughout this year, and that's what we'd anticipated. We originally had expected core inflation this year of 5% to 5.5%, and that's pretty much where we finished. It was higher than that in the first half of the year, better than the average in the second. So I feel like our cost per shipment will likely get back into more consistent with our longer-term average, probably be somewhere around the 4% mark or so. And that 4% plus or minus where we land, obviously, you can do a little bit better than that if you get volume growth and you're getting density and so forth, that drives a lot of operating efficiencies. We've dealt with the opposite over the last year, year and a half. But that number, when you think about it, a lot of our line items, I mentioned the insurance premiums, but we've dealt with significant cost inflation in many of the income statement line items that we have over time. And fortunately, we've been able to improve operating efficiencies and do other things to mitigate that such that our longer-term inflation on a cost per shipment basis has been in that 3.5% to 4% range.\nThomas Wadewitz: Right. Okay. Yes, that's all very helpful. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to follow-up on that last question. Based on the recent contract conversations, you said, certainly, your peers continue to raise price. Do you feel fairly confident you can maintain your historic 1 to 1.5 point spread above that cost inflation this year?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. That's always the focus for us. And again, that's why, especially when we get into stronger demand environments. We've historically seen competitors raising rates faster than us. And a lot of that in the past, I think, has been driven by competitors that generally run their networks closer to full utilization. And so if they've not been able to grow volumes in those large upswings, they take advantage of the strength in the market and get more by way of rate. And we like to do both and go back to reference 2018 and 2021, we outgrew the market in those years, 1,000 to 1,200 basis points, meaning on an LTL tons per day basis and we're able to get good consistent yield increases in those years as well. But to us we feel like it's better, it's worked over time to be able to sit across the table from a customer and talk about our cost inflation and say we need cost plus. The plus comes into supporting the long-term consistent investments that we've made in our service center network. We've invested $2 billion in our network over the past 10 years to consistently grow it. And we've increased our door count by about 50% over that last 10-year basis. And right now, there's still some dust to settle, but the 10 years that ended 2022, the industry's number of service centers are down about 10%, at least for the public carrier. So that's something that's created an advantage for us in the marketplace. It's something that we always want to invest in, in capacity, invest in technology that's designed to improve our customer service, to connect to our customers or to be able to drive operating efficiencies for us to keep our cost inflation low. So we're always investing in capacity and technology on behalf of our customers generally, and that's why we've got to build those costs into our price model. But to us, it's a lot easier to sit and say, we want a consistent approach, if you will, versus just something that's more market-driven, trying to get big increases in when the market is in our favor and not as much as the markets in the shipper's favor. It's a formula that's worked over time and it's what we continue to focus on as we go forward.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Good morning gentlemen. How should we think about sort of normal seasonal patterns as we move throughout the year and your year-over-year comparisons with tonnage in terms of when you first started seeing the freight come over from Yellow?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Obviously, it was midyear in the third quarter when they closed and we got that bump. We were at 47,000 shipments per day for the longest time.\nJason Seidl: Right. But you didn't see it earlier as they started to bleed a little bit in June?\nAdam Satterfield: Not really. I mean our monthly average was 47,000 from December of 2022 through July of 2023. So it's flat there, and then we got an initial bump of about 3,000 shipments per day. And we stayed pretty consistent there from around 50,000 or a little bit north of that from August through November and then just had the seasonal drop through December. So as we're starting out, right now, we're a little below January of last year, which as just mentioned, is at 47,000 \u2013 if we get the bump, that the normal seasonal bump, if you will, that would sort of put us flattish with February and March. And then the question will be, are we getting some type of normal seasonality. If so, that would put the second quarter above the second quarter of last year, and then we can kind of go from there, if you will.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Makes sense. I want to clarify also something that you guys said. You mentioned you expect an exit of capacity once the dust settles when you were talking about the terminals. Are you talking an exit of capacity from where we are now? Or are you talking a total exit of capacity from when Yellow was an operator?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. When Yellow was in operations. I mean, obviously, they had, what, 45,000, 50,000 shipments per day, and they had how many other service centers that they did. And net-net, there's going to be a reduction in those number of service centers that were in operation. There's still quite a few that have not settled in any way. And that's what we had believed. We thought that they would be an exit of some percent of their capacity, if you will. But that same level of freight has got to be moved. And I continue to believe that some of it is currently in the truckload world. And so I think that there'll likely be a second wave of freight that comes into LTL once the overall market is improving, the truckload world is getting back to normal, and if you've got truckload carriers they're looking for any payload and maybe willing to handle a 5,000 to 10,000 pound LTL and try to put multiple large shipments on one trailer together and do multiple stops. That's the type of freight that they will shy away from once the market improves, and will spill right back into the market and become normalized LTL freight again. So I think that that's another unique opportunity probably for 2024 that should provide a little bit of tailwind to everyone.\nJason Seidl: Yes. Well, I'm hoping it comes back in 2024 for a normalized market. We all have been waiting for it for quite some time. So fingers crossed. Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay, great. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess going back to the weight per shipment and just broader demand comment you were making earlier, Adam, I mean, we saw weight per shipment tick up a bit sequentially in the fourth quarter. I know some of that was probably seasonality. But are you starting to see anything, whether it's conversations with customers that would lead you to be a little bit more optimistic about how underlying demand may be trending as we kind of get into the spring. And I guess kind of within that, are you seeing anything different whether it's consumer versus your industrial customer base. Just would be curious about that.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, sure. The weight per shipment in the fourth quarter was a little bit stronger than it was in the third, which is fairly typical. And we've seen so far in January, normally, we'd have a drop in weight per shipment of about 2% to 3%. And our weight per shipment is \u2013 right now, it's about 1,515 pounds in January. And so it's dropped a little bit, but better than what the normal seasonal trend would otherwise be from December. So I think that's usually an early indicator on the economy is going to start turning. We try to read all the economic tea leaves and look at things like the inventory to sales ratio and have conversations with customers that would indicate that inventories are normalized, lower than maybe where they should be. And so that causes us to be cautiously optimistic about what may end up coming at us this year, but we still want to be careful about not getting ahead of it after missing it in the spring of 2023. So I certainly feel like there's some opportunity there to see some real recovery in volumes this year, and we'll be prepared for that if it happens. I mentioned that ISM has been below 50 for 14 months. And my goodness, that's just been such a long slow period, the slow cycle is getting as old as Methuselah. We're ready for it to recover, but we've seen that impact in our business levels. Our revenue in the fourth quarter on the industrial side was a little bit slower than the company average. So that, too will be an area of opportunity once we can start seeing some, some improvement there.\nJack Atkins: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on service. You've been kind of been up against the ceiling on claims ratio and on-time performance for some time now. So I guess I'm just wondering what else you can do to improve the customer experience and stay differentiated, particularly as you're looking to maintain your pricing strategy and keep taking share. Not sure if there are opportunities with technology or speed in certain lanes or anything else? Just trying to get a sense for where you're focused outside of those typical metrics we track.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I mean, obviously, the two metrics that we talk about the most are on-time performance and claims ratio. One, it's \u2013 we got to stay focused to make sure that we keep those where they are and make sure as we hire new people as we start growing and things like that, that we don't see those numbers change in any way. So we're always striving for perfection because every shipment we pick up, it's \u2013 we're helping the world keep promises, right? That's a shipment that is going to our customers' customer, and we want to make sure that it's delivered on time and without damage. But when we study the Mastio quality data that we get every year, there's 28 attributes related to service and value that they measure. So obviously, there's much more than just being on time and claims-free. And so we study that data very intently and look at any feedback in areas where we can continue to improve. And we've done that over time, and we're proud that we won 25 of the 28, we were number one in 25 of the 28 Mastio categories in this most recent year. So we're always striving to get better. That's part of our foundation for success is continuous improvement. So we always look for ways and stay engaged with our customers to figure out the things that we can do for them, to drive value, to create win-win scenarios. And so it's just a never ending battle to try to stay ahead of the curve, particularly with respect to technology, so much is changing there, the things that we can do to try to connect more with our customers, drive some automation on the \u2013 in the corporate office and the back end processing and so forth. So a lot of opportunities there to keep improving the customer service experience and also mitigating cost when it comes to our technology investments.\nEric Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to maybe double click a little bit on your commentary on the labor and adding to headcount this year. I just wanted to maybe compare your view on headcount additions for 2024 versus 2023, I think I was under the assumption that in 2023 that you were able to hold on to some labor, kind of protect as many drivers and physicians as possible kind of waiting for the demand to pick up in 2024. So just trying to compare, I think, that commentary from prior quarters to your outlook for this year. Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. And we did have some attrition as we work through 2023. So the overall headcount has been lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis as we went through the year. And like I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, in particular, the average headcount was down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, but it was up compared to the third quarter of this year. And so we're adding some positions. We're just under 23,000 employees was our average for the fourth quarter, and that compares back to \u2013 we were 24,000, 25,000 average full-time employees back in parts of 2022. So it will be shipment driven. Typically, when you look at long-term changes in our shipments per day and long-term changes in our headcount. Those two numbers are very closely aligned. And so you're exactly right. We were trying to hang on to as many people as we could, particularly our drivers that we've invested so much in, as we progress through this last year, 1.5 years of slower economic times, and that gave us an advantage. I mentioned this earlier, but we had employees that have their CDLs and they were working primarily on the dock. And when we saw that positive inflection in volumes back in the third quarter, that was something that we were easily able to tap into and put those folks right back into a truck. So that worked to our advantage. We're running our truck driving schools right now to continue to produce more employees that have their CDLs, and will be available to drive as demand continues to improve. So that's why we're always trying to keep our focus on the long-term and be prepared for when the demand gets strong and we start seeing the levels of shipment growth like we've been able to experience in the past, back in 2021, we grew shipments per day at 19.5% at that year, our competition was up 4%. And we were able to accommodate that 19% shipment growth, and be able to keep our service metrics best-in-class and so forth. And it's that investment and trying to stay ahead of the curve with all the things that we do, with all three elements of capacity that allows us to put on significant levels of growth like that when the demand environment dictates.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, seeing any difficulties meeting some of those hiring or headcount additions thus far this year? Just trying to get a sense of the strength of the labor environment?\nAdam Satterfield: Not at this point. And again, we're trying to get ahead of it a little bit in the sense of creating some of our own drivers. But I think right now, just the state of the market overall, it's totally different than, compare and contrast to 2021, when things were so tight everywhere, and it was more of a challenge to get drivers. That's why we focus so much on keeping everyone that we could through the slow period, but go ahead and starting our schools back up, well ahead of the growth coming at us. We want to make sure that particularly with respect to drivers that we get ahead of it as best we can.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So just maybe a bigger picture question. Adam, someone asked about pricing earlier, and you answered, well, based on normal seasonality, here's what yields would look like. And I would have thought maybe with this big Yellow event that maybe would be better than normal seasonality on pricing. And same thing, right, where Yellow has gone and tonnage is still down. And so I guess, ultimate question is we all treated Yellow as this really, really big event in the industry. Is it not really a big event? Or is it that \u2013 it's a really big deal, but it's all being masked by slow macro and ultimately, whenever the macro gets better, we'll really feel the impact of Yellow and it's all still sort of on the come?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I certainly think it's \u2013 the macro being in the state that it is, that helped the carriers absorb the freight that they were hauling before and pretty effectively. And \u2013 but like I mentioned, I think some of that freight has gone into some different modes and believe that, that will be short lived until really demand improves overall for transportation in general. But \u2013 now when it comes to pricing and just the yield improvement that we've had, we have incredibly strong yield performance in 2021, followed that up with 2022. And then our rev per hundredweight ex-fuel was up 8.1% this year. So some of that, like I mentioned, has been mix driven, but we've had really strong yield performance really over the last three years. But we've said even during that time, that our strategy is what it is. And we think it has worked for us. And when we operate at 72% for the year, I don't know that anyone else will be anywhere close to that. And so \u2013 but it's just a disciplined focus of keeping our costs as low as we can, and then pricing, understanding our cost on a per customer basis and then having a yield that makes sense to try to constantly improve the profitability on each customer account. But we've never said that, that was the right long-term rate. We just want to be consistent and be fair with our customers in that 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread of yield above cost has worked for us. But we were in a much different position than a lot of other carriers, I think, in terms of that long-term consistency that we've had in our pricing, we didn't have the same need to go out and try to take advantage of that market change and really increase rates in any way. We kept the same measured, fair approach. And I think that pays dividends. I think it is a reason why we've had good volume stability as well when we've gone through this last slow period, is that we've got good customer relationships. Freight at the end of the day is a relationship business, and so we want to continue to strengthen relationships and we've got an understanding with our customer base in terms of what we're trying to achieve. And you work through a slow year, we really didn't have any major customer losses. We didn't lose lanes from customers. We kept most of our large national accounts as we progress through the year, just the volume weakness was a result of \u2013 there were reduced orders for our customers' products. So pleased with the customer retention that we had last year and look forward to demand improves for our customers' products, we're in place and we'll be able to bring on that freight into the truck line. And get back to doing what we do best, which is growth.\nScott Group: That's helpful. I know we're past here. If I can just sneak in one more. I'm just looking at this like, 2022, you guys bought back a lot of stock at the lows and your pace of buybacks have really slowed the last couple of quarters, sort of with the stock at the high. So you've had a pretty good feel for your stock. How are you thinking about your buyback this year?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, we'll have the same approach that we always do. We start looking at what we think our cash from operations will be and then what we're going to spend with capital expenditures. And then we have the fixed dividend component. And the net cash balance, we target trying to return to shareholders through the buyback program. But we generally have a grid-based approach where we're buying more when the stock is lower, and I mean, less when it's higher, but consistently in the market. And I think that's what you've seen. But that $1.3 billion was double what we spent, about $600 million the year prior. And so it was reduced this year in the back half, in particular. But as we go into 2024, we'll just continue to look at how much free cash we think that we'll have and how much we try to return to shareholders and in what ways as we go through the year such that we don't obviously want too much cash building up on the balance sheet. But it's all about driving returns on invested capital, and we've done a pretty good job over time, with improving that metric.\nScott Group: Thank you, Adam.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. Today's last question comes from James Monigan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJames Monigan: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Actually, I want to follow-up on Scott's question. Like, about sort of the yields versus seasonality and pricing versus seasonality. You've mentioned that the market sort of moved pricing up and your competitors have been aggressive on that. And you have improved or have strong service. And so has that like sort of fair price moved away from where it is now? And is there a bit of a catch-up trade on price across the remainder of the year relative to service, based on where everybody else is in the market?\nAdam Satterfield: I'm not sure that I fully understand your question, but like I mentioned before, that we anticipated that, that metric would eventually compress back to longer-term averages. And for us, it's 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread, which by the way, reconciles to the average operating ratio improvement, we've been able to generate over time as well. And so we'll continue to do our best to manage our cost and to continue to ask for necessary increases on our customer accounts to offset the cost inflation that we'll have in the business and to support the wage increases that we give to our employees to allow us to retain the employees that we have, but continue to attract new employees to our business as well, which we've been able to do over time to support the consistent growth that we've been able to produce. So it takes a lot to keep growing the company year in and year out. And to be able to keep our cost inflation as we're doing so as well. So try to keep that cost under control and keep asking for that same positive spread over time, that's what our focus is going to be.\nJames Monigan: Yes. And just real quick on a percentage basis, how much do you expect to grow doors this coming year or any other measure of capacity?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, we've probably got line of sight into adding four or five service centers. As Marty mentioned, we've got several that have been under construction. But a lot of that will really depend on the volume environment as well. In the past, we've finished service centers and may complete the construction, we have to start depreciating them and incurring other overhead-type costs with them, but if the volumes don't dictate the opening, then we might sort of keep them in ready reserve, if you will, and wait until volumes are stronger to start incurring the cost because with growth, that's another incremental cost, every new service center that we opened. You've got incremental line-haul cost and other expenses that we're going to incur as a result of that opening. In addition to just the general depreciation and overhead. So that will be something that we'll be mindful of as we go through the year. And hopefully, the volume environment will be such that we're ready to open them and turn them on day one as soon as we're finished.\nJames Monigan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Marty Freeman for closing remarks.\nKevin Freeman: Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. With me today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's fourth quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy, which is similar to how the economic environment fell throughout much of 2023. As a result, the rebound in volumes that we had anticipated back in the spring never fully materialized. Despite the softness in the economy and weaker-than-expected volumes, the OD team faithfully executed on the same long-term strategic plan that has guided us through the ups and downs of the economic cycle many times before. During the fourth quarter, our LTL tons per day decreased 2% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Although our LTL shipments per day and overall market share improved, we also improved the quality of our revenue during the quarter as well, which contributed to an increase in both our quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share for the first time in 2023. We believe that underlying demand for our LTL service remained consistent in the quarter, which corresponds to the consistency in our volume trends. The stability of our volumes also reflects our ongoing ability to deliver best-in-class value proposition. We were pleased to provide an on-time service performance of 99%, and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during the quarter, which also supported the ongoing execution of our yield management initiatives. We have said many times before that long-term improvement in our operating ratio is dependent upon a consistent improvement in density and yield, both of which generally require the support of a positive macro environment. While our network density was challenged this year, we improved our yield by maintaining our consistent cost-based approach to our pricing. This approach focuses on improving the profitability of each customer through yield increases that are designed to offset our cost inflation and support further investments in capacity and technology. We continue to invest significantly during the 2023, as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our capital expenditures totaled $757.3 million for the year, of which $291.1 million was spent for the ongoing expansion of our service center network. We opened two new service centers in 2023 and have several others under construction and nearly complete that could be opened quickly once the demand environment improves. Our team knows firsthand how quickly the demand environment can change in the LTL industry, and we are very experienced at growing our company without sacrificing the quality of our service. To do so, however, requires us to maintain a certain amount of excess capacity in our service center network. We are pleased to currently have approximately 30% excess capacity in our network, and we have the ability to expand it further as needed to help ensure our network is never limiting factor to our growth. While the investments in our service center network, our equipment and our technology further improved the overall quality of our service in 2023, the best investment we made was in the OD Family of employees. We improved the capabilities of our team and strengthened our unique company culture, which has defined OD for many years. Our long-term strategic plan may sound simple on the surface, but no one in our industry has been able to replicate our success because they do not have our people or our culture. Our team is fully committed to our proven business model. And as a result, we believe we are strongly positioned to respond to a positive inflection in demand once the domestic economy begins to improve. We are confident in the opportunities that lie ahead, and it is our belief, our team's focus on delivering superior service at a fair price will support our ability to produce further profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. I want to thank you today for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day."

            "name": "Adam Satterfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $1.5 billion, which was a 0.3% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 3.0% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight that more than offset the 2.0% decrease in LTL tons per day. Our quarterly operating ratio was 71.8% and earnings per diluted share were $2.94, which was a 0.7% increase from last year. As Marty previously mentioned, this was the first quarter with an increase in both revenue and earnings per diluted share since the fourth quarter of last year. While it certainly has not felt like one of our record years from the past, $2.94 also represents a new company record for fourth quarter earnings per diluted share. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the fourth quarter increased 1.9% when compared to the third quarter of 2023, with LTL tons per day increasing 0.6%, and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.8% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.6% in tons per day and a decrease of 3.4% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the fourth quarter were as follows: October decreased 0.7% as compared to September, November decreased 0.6% from October and December decreased 4.8% as compared to November. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 3.5% in October, an increase of 3.5% in November and a decrease of 8.0% in December. For January, we expect our revenue per day will decrease approximately 3.1% as compared to January of 2023, with a decrease of approximately 5.1% in our LTL tons per day. These numbers could be plus or minus 10 basis points or 20 basis points, depending upon today's revenue performance. We expect our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, will increase approximately 6.4%, which is generally in line with normal seasonality for this metric. We will file the actual revenue-related details for January in our Form 10-K. Our operating ratio increased 60 basis points to 71.8% for the fourth quarter. We continued to operate efficiently during the quarter despite the lack of network density, but our direct operating costs increased as a percent of revenue. The increase in these costs was primarily due to an increase in our insurance and claims expense as a percent of revenue, which is attributable to changes in the annual adjustment we record in our fourth quarter each year relating to our third-party actuarial reviews. We were otherwise pleased with our control over direct operating costs during the quarter, as our team did a nice job of matching labor to current revenue trends. While our LTL shipments per day increased, our average headcount was down 4.1% when compared to the fourth quarter 2022. We currently believe that our workforce is appropriately sized for our current shipment trends, but we will likely need to add to our workforce this year as volumes begin to improve. Our overhead cost also increased as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to control discretionary spending. Depreciation expense as a percent of revenue increased 80 basis points when compared to the fourth quarter 2022, due primarily to the execution of our 2023 capital expenditure plan. The increases in depreciation and other overhead costs were partially offset by a 90 basis point improvement in our miscellaneous expenses as a percent of revenue, which included $15.1 million of gains on the disposal of property and equipment. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $436.7 million for the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, while capital expenditures were $105.9 million and $757.3 million for the same respective periods. We utilized $85.5 million and $453.6 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the fourth quarter and 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.6 million and $175.1 million for the same periods. We were pleased that our Board of Directors approved a 30% increase for the quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share for the first quarter of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 24.1% as compared to 25.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. We currently anticipate our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for 2024. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Sure. Certainly our long-term story has been winning market share over time, and we believe we'll continue to win market share into the future as well primarily based on the value proposition that we offer a superior service at a fair price. And as we mentioned earlier, our on-time service continued to be 99% during the quarter, and our claims ratio is at 0.1%, and that is what's driven our market share over time. Typically, when we're in a slower macro environment like we've been in, our market share tends to be flatter. But once we start seeing a recovery in the economy, that's when we think our model signs the brightest. If you look back in periods past, when the up cycle begins, that's when we've got plenty of network capacity, the job that we've done with managing our people capacity and equipment capacity as well, combining with the real estate positions us to capitalize on those upswings. And that's when in the past, we've been able to outgrow the other publicly traded peers anywhere from 600 basis points to 1,000 basis points. So we're still waiting on that positive inflection in the economy, but I feel like we're better positioned than we've ever been to capitalize on it when the upswing begins. Well, I think that there's a lot of settling that still needs to occur post the Yellow closing their doors. But if you go back a year or more, we were a capacity constrained industry, and I feel like once all the dust settles, capacity is shifting around a bit, but will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. All of those service centers will not end up in the market, yet all of those freight shipments will be and will have to be handled by someone. So I feel like, especially once the economy recovers, we'll most likely be viewed as a capacity constrained industry once again. I don't think so. Just like I mentioned before, we've been able to win market share over the long-term based on the quality of our service, first and foremost, on the value proposition that we're offering our customers. And we believe that, that same formula will continue to win share for us, as we go forward, it takes having capacity to be able to continue to grow. And that's why we've always invested ahead of the growth curve and tried to target having about 25% excess capacity in the service center network at all times. And so right now, we mentioned that we're at about 30% excess capacity. So we're a little north of where we've historically been, but we believe it's always important to consistently invest and keep that focus on the long-term opportunities and that certainly played to our benefit in the past. And it's hard to say with the Yellow process, with their service centers. But net-net, we believe that there would be some exit of capacity, and I think that's generally what we'll end up seeing once all the dust has settled on things. And we obviously took a look at those service centers early on, didn't end up with anything. And that's why given the state of where our network is today and the opportunities that we continue to have to expand it, and we felt like just given the cost that \u2013 you can see now in hindsight that it was better for us to just maintain control, our network is in a great spot as it is, but we continue to have the ability to control when we add to the network in time, where we decide to add the facilities and how exactly we want to build them. So we felt like continuing with the same formula that's worked for so many years for us. We want to keep executing on that same business plan as we go forward. Yes. Winter weather comes every year, and it's something that we contend with, and is generally in our averages. So we don't view that as a one-time event. But a couple of weeks ago, us and everyone else had to deal with weather issues and made up for a little bit of lost ground with that last week. And then we've got a short week to finish out the month, the year. So we'll see where the final numbers land. But as of right now, our shipments per day are trending pretty much in line with where we thought they would be. I gave the 10-year average earlier with respect to the sequential changes from a shipments per day standpoint. Our December was 5.9% below November, that's better than the 10-year average. But over the last five years, we've kind of changed \u2013 we've given one extra day of paid time off around the holidays. And so our five-year average in December is actually a decrease of 6.5%. So we were a little bit better than that revised average that changes the month a little bit, not so much the quarter. But looking at January, the five-year average sequential change is a plus 0.3% increase, and so we'll see where we end up. But I feel like that certainly that number has been impacted a little bit, looks like it's going to come in below that overall sequential number that we would go up a bit. But how much will we get back in February, where we see kind of a traditional bump and then March will continue to be the important month. That's a month where we're typically up about 5% sequentially over February. And if you remember, we anticipated in 2023 that we would see a recovery in the spring. And unfortunately, it didn't materialize like we thought it would, but that will kind of be the key point for this quarter is will we start seeing that reacceleration in our business levels, and that obviously dictate a lot in terms of the operating ratio and general performance for the first quarter. Well, the normal change in OR from the fourth to the first quarter is about a 100 basis point increase, maybe 110 basis points. And those two particular items that we called out in the press release, we'd expect some normalization, if you will. To start with, the insurance and claims, that was 1.9% of revenue in the fourth quarter. That number had averaged 1.2%, 1.3% each quarter in the first three quarters of the year. And so we'd expect that to somewhat normalize and our expense to be more consistent in the first, second and third quarters of 2024. Now it maybe a little bit higher \u2013 we've had four or five straight years of double-digit premium increases and continue to contend with higher cost in that line item, but I still expect that, that would be maybe 1.3%, 1.4% of revenue in the first quarter. So get maybe 50 basis points of benefit, if you will, as we transition into the first quarter on that line item. And then the miscellaneous expenses, we wouldn't expect for those gains to be that significant. That was pretty unusual. Typically, that miscellaneous \u2013 the expense line item is 40 basis points or 50 basis points. And so we'd expect that to somewhat go back to normal as well. So that could be kind of 100 basis point, 110 basis point headwind. So I think just net-net, thinking about the 71.8 that we did in the fourth quarter, as we transition into the first, maybe 170 basis points to 220 basis points deterioration, 170 would be kind of normalizing for those items that I just mentioned. And then just maybe being on the high side of that was just the uncertainty of where we really get the economic recovery and volume performance through the quarter, that acceleration that we normally would. If we get that acceleration, we're certainly managing all of our costs, and it could be on the low end of the scale or better. But as of right now, probably better to just handicap it on the higher side of that normalized average. Well, I won't say anybody overpaid. We looked at the whole thing, obviously, with that initial bid and felt like if we could get everything and get it at somewhat of a discounted pricing than we were willing to take that risk, and obviously, it would have come with increased cost if we had absorbed all that property. But I think each carrier is different, they look at those opportunities. And I guess that fit in with their long-term strategic plan. I think if anything, it's increased in the cost basis. And like we've said for many years, as we've invested in real estate, you've got to build that into your overall cost structure and appropriately capture that with rates. And that's been our strategy over time and it's certainly played to our advantage. So if our competitors' cost structures are increasing, I wouldn't expect that they would change their approach to pricing. But I think if anything, they've got to build it in there and try to capture for it. But fortunately, that's something that we're not having to contend with. Like I mentioned earlier, we're good with our strategy, and we feel like it's worked for us over time, and we believe that same formula and strategy can continue to work for us in the future. So that's what we're going to keep executing under. Sure. Yes. You're right. We do an annual actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter each year of our reserves. And so we, unfortunately, had an unfavorable adjustment this year. And those go either way. The last few years, they've been favorable adjustments. And we've got an expense rate that we use through the first three quarters of the year, and that's why you see that number that's more consistent, if you will, but \u2013 and then we just had that third-party review done make adjustments and then just kind of move on. But just looking at that activity, that's why I think that our expense rate will be a little bit higher in 2024 through the first three quarters versus where we were last year, but maybe only 10, 20 basis points or so, and then we'll conduct another actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter of 2024, make whatever adjustments are necessary then and then just move on. But I think it's been \u2013 since 2019 was last year, we had an unfavorable one. So best case scenarios when we get to the end of the year, they conduct the study, and we don't have an adjustment either way. But unfortunately, this year, it was an unfavorable one. Yes. That's a lot in one question. I'll see if I can keep it all straight. But we have heard about some service issues and we obviously stay very engaged with our customer base, our large national accounts and 3PL customer accounts as well and meet with them often. And so we have heard about some service issues and believe that, that's something that may continue. And it's very typical in an up cycle, especially. And so I think some of the carriers that maybe took on some of that extra Yellow business may cause some issues for them throughout the system or their system. And so that's usually a source of market share for us especially when the economy starts to pick up. But from a pricing standpoint, it's continued to be a very favorable pricing environment, I would say. We've seen \u2013 obviously, we've continued on with our consistent and cost-based increases, and that will be our strategy going forward as well. But just looking at some of the GRIs and some of the feedback that we've had from [indiscernible] as well, it seems like the other carriers have continued to push for increases. So that's generally a good thing for us as well. If the competitors are increasing their rates. And again, increasing demand environments. Generally, we see competitors that are increasing rates faster than us. And if we're at a price premium to the market and that gap closes, that too, creates market share opportunity for us. So that's why we feel good about where we're positioned and the opportunities that we have going forward. It's been a long, slow cycle that we've been in. ISM has been below 50 for 14 months now. And you compare that to 2008, 2009, I think, was below 50 for 12 months. It's been a very long, slow cycle that we're ready to get back to growing again. But, you know, going through these slow cycles requires patience. And I think we've managed well, managed cost efficiencies, managed our discretionary spending to go through a year where tonnage was down 9%. Our operating ratio was at 72, to me was pretty remarkable. And so I'm really proud of what our team accomplished this year and what we've done to position ourselves for opportunities that are ahead. Yes. I mean, obviously, a lot of it is going to be volume dependent, and we'll really get some type of economic recovery and when does that begin? It'd be great to see it start early. But I'm not sure that the general economic forecasters are predicting that things are going to start so early in the year. But we're ready. We actually hired and increased our headcount during the fourth quarter, much of which was on the platform where we were hiring folks to backfill some of the jobs where our combo employees with the freight volumes that were higher in the second half of the year, we pulled people off the dock and put them right back into a truck, and we're driving again. So we backfilled some of those positions in particular. But we're cautiously optimistic about things, and we're not going to get ahead of it by any means. So once we start seeing line of sight into some volume recovery, and increased demand, and we'll make sure that we're adding to the workforce as appropriate to keep up with it to make sure that we're efficiently handling any growth that comes without any sacrifice to the quality of our service. But I would say that from a big picture standpoint, when you look back in time and just thinking about the fiscal year overall, generally, when we've gone through a slow period, even going back to 2009, 2016, 2019, we've gone through periods that have been really slow. If we've lost anything from an operating ratio standpoint when the volumes and revenue come back into the system, we've been able to more than recover that OR loss. And back to our cost structure and really pleased with the performance, as I said, but we generated improvement in our direct operating cost for the year this year, even despite the lack of density that we had with the volume weakness. And really, the OR loss was just limited to our overhead expenses increasing, and most of that was depreciation as we continue to expand the network as we brought in new equipment into our fleet to replace some of the older stuff that we've been hanging on to the last couple of years with OEM challenges. So as we incurred a lot of the expense on our own selectively, we're positioning ourselves to capitalize on future growth opportunities. So that will be the power of leverage in the model, is once we get that topline growth going again, we'll continue to be able to improve further those direct operating costs as a percent of revenue, but we regained lost ground on the overhead side, get right back to the operating ratio improvement and have that same formula work and where we're growing the topline, improving the operating ratio and having the income growing faster than the revenues. And that's producing profitable growth has been our long-term story, and it's led to a big increase in shareholder value over time as well. Sure. Yes, from a \u2013 just a revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharge, if you apply normal seasonality quarter-by-quarter, then the yields would compress to around 6.5% growth, kind of in the first and second quarters, and then that would start to moderate to be closer to 5.5% by the fourth quarter, which \u2013 as you know, if you look long-term, our revenue per shipment has been more in the 5%, 5.5% range over time. So we'd expect, absent any mix changes for that \u2013 for us to be able to get consistent increases as we go through the year, as bids are coming new and that's why you just see that absolute number increase quarter-by-quarter. But that rate of growth may start to compress. Now granted, I had anticipated that it would compress a little bit last year and we had the decrease in weight per shipment. And so that supported some of that reported yield metric. Now the reverse could happen this year, especially as we get into the back half of the year. If the economy is improving, we'd expect weight per shipment to be higher, and that generally results in a lower revenue per hundredweight. So \u2013 but higher revenue per shipment. So it all kind of balanced out. We believe this year. That will be the more important factor, though, we feel like is will we start seeing some real growth in that revenue \u2013 or I mean, weight per shipment metric rather, that would mean that orders for our customers' products are starting to increase. There's more widgets for every shipment. And that's what we hope that we'll start seeing sometime soon here early this year. From a cost per shipment standpoint, we saw a moderation in our cost per shipment throughout this year, and that's what we'd anticipated. We originally had expected core inflation this year of 5% to 5.5%, and that's pretty much where we finished. It was higher than that in the first half of the year, better than the average in the second. So I feel like our cost per shipment will likely get back into more consistent with our longer-term average, probably be somewhere around the 4% mark or so. And that 4% plus or minus where we land, obviously, you can do a little bit better than that if you get volume growth and you're getting density and so forth, that drives a lot of operating efficiencies. We've dealt with the opposite over the last year, year and a half. But that number, when you think about it, a lot of our line items, I mentioned the insurance premiums, but we've dealt with significant cost inflation in many of the income statement line items that we have over time. And fortunately, we've been able to improve operating efficiencies and do other things to mitigate that such that our longer-term inflation on a cost per shipment basis has been in that 3.5% to 4% range. Yes. That's always the focus for us. And again, that's why, especially when we get into stronger demand environments. We've historically seen competitors raising rates faster than us. And a lot of that in the past, I think, has been driven by competitors that generally run their networks closer to full utilization. And so if they've not been able to grow volumes in those large upswings, they take advantage of the strength in the market and get more by way of rate. And we like to do both and go back to reference 2018 and 2021, we outgrew the market in those years, 1,000 to 1,200 basis points, meaning on an LTL tons per day basis and we're able to get good consistent yield increases in those years as well. But to us we feel like it's better, it's worked over time to be able to sit across the table from a customer and talk about our cost inflation and say we need cost plus. The plus comes into supporting the long-term consistent investments that we've made in our service center network. We've invested $2 billion in our network over the past 10 years to consistently grow it. And we've increased our door count by about 50% over that last 10-year basis. And right now, there's still some dust to settle, but the 10 years that ended 2022, the industry's number of service centers are down about 10%, at least for the public carrier. So that's something that's created an advantage for us in the marketplace. It's something that we always want to invest in, in capacity, invest in technology that's designed to improve our customer service, to connect to our customers or to be able to drive operating efficiencies for us to keep our cost inflation low. So we're always investing in capacity and technology on behalf of our customers generally, and that's why we've got to build those costs into our price model. But to us, it's a lot easier to sit and say, we want a consistent approach, if you will, versus just something that's more market-driven, trying to get big increases in when the market is in our favor and not as much as the markets in the shipper's favor. It's a formula that's worked over time and it's what we continue to focus on as we go forward. Yes. Obviously, it was midyear in the third quarter when they closed and we got that bump. We were at 47,000 shipments per day for the longest time. Not really. I mean our monthly average was 47,000 from December of 2022 through July of 2023. So it's flat there, and then we got an initial bump of about 3,000 shipments per day. And we stayed pretty consistent there from around 50,000 or a little bit north of that from August through November and then just had the seasonal drop through December. So as we're starting out, right now, we're a little below January of last year, which as just mentioned, is at 47,000 \u2013 if we get the bump, that the normal seasonal bump, if you will, that would sort of put us flattish with February and March. And then the question will be, are we getting some type of normal seasonality. If so, that would put the second quarter above the second quarter of last year, and then we can kind of go from there, if you will. Yes. When Yellow was in operations. I mean, obviously, they had, what, 45,000, 50,000 shipments per day, and they had how many other service centers that they did. And net-net, there's going to be a reduction in those number of service centers that were in operation. There's still quite a few that have not settled in any way. And that's what we had believed. We thought that they would be an exit of some percent of their capacity, if you will. But that same level of freight has got to be moved. And I continue to believe that some of it is currently in the truckload world. And so I think that there'll likely be a second wave of freight that comes into LTL once the overall market is improving, the truckload world is getting back to normal, and if you've got truckload carriers they're looking for any payload and maybe willing to handle a 5,000 to 10,000 pound LTL and try to put multiple large shipments on one trailer together and do multiple stops. That's the type of freight that they will shy away from once the market improves, and will spill right back into the market and become normalized LTL freight again. So I think that that's another unique opportunity probably for 2024 that should provide a little bit of tailwind to everyone. Yes, sure. The weight per shipment in the fourth quarter was a little bit stronger than it was in the third, which is fairly typical. And we've seen so far in January, normally, we'd have a drop in weight per shipment of about 2% to 3%. And our weight per shipment is \u2013 right now, it's about 1,515 pounds in January. And so it's dropped a little bit, but better than what the normal seasonal trend would otherwise be from December. So I think that's usually an early indicator on the economy is going to start turning. We try to read all the economic tea leaves and look at things like the inventory to sales ratio and have conversations with customers that would indicate that inventories are normalized, lower than maybe where they should be. And so that causes us to be cautiously optimistic about what may end up coming at us this year, but we still want to be careful about not getting ahead of it after missing it in the spring of 2023. So I certainly feel like there's some opportunity there to see some real recovery in volumes this year, and we'll be prepared for that if it happens. I mentioned that ISM has been below 50 for 14 months. And my goodness, that's just been such a long slow period, the slow cycle is getting as old as Methuselah. We're ready for it to recover, but we've seen that impact in our business levels. Our revenue in the fourth quarter on the industrial side was a little bit slower than the company average. So that, too will be an area of opportunity once we can start seeing some, some improvement there. Yes. I mean, obviously, the two metrics that we talk about the most are on-time performance and claims ratio. One, it's \u2013 we got to stay focused to make sure that we keep those where they are and make sure as we hire new people as we start growing and things like that, that we don't see those numbers change in any way. So we're always striving for perfection because every shipment we pick up, it's \u2013 we're helping the world keep promises, right? That's a shipment that is going to our customers' customer, and we want to make sure that it's delivered on time and without damage. But when we study the Mastio quality data that we get every year, there's 28 attributes related to service and value that they measure. So obviously, there's much more than just being on time and claims-free. And so we study that data very intently and look at any feedback in areas where we can continue to improve. And we've done that over time, and we're proud that we won 25 of the 28, we were number one in 25 of the 28 Mastio categories in this most recent year. So we're always striving to get better. That's part of our foundation for success is continuous improvement. So we always look for ways and stay engaged with our customers to figure out the things that we can do for them, to drive value, to create win-win scenarios. And so it's just a never ending battle to try to stay ahead of the curve, particularly with respect to technology, so much is changing there, the things that we can do to try to connect more with our customers, drive some automation on the \u2013 in the corporate office and the back end processing and so forth. So a lot of opportunities there to keep improving the customer service experience and also mitigating cost when it comes to our technology investments. Sure. And we did have some attrition as we work through 2023. So the overall headcount has been lower on a quarter-over-quarter basis as we went through the year. And like I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, in particular, the average headcount was down 4% compared to the fourth quarter of last year, but it was up compared to the third quarter of this year. And so we're adding some positions. We're just under 23,000 employees was our average for the fourth quarter, and that compares back to \u2013 we were 24,000, 25,000 average full-time employees back in parts of 2022. So it will be shipment driven. Typically, when you look at long-term changes in our shipments per day and long-term changes in our headcount. Those two numbers are very closely aligned. And so you're exactly right. We were trying to hang on to as many people as we could, particularly our drivers that we've invested so much in, as we progress through this last year, 1.5 years of slower economic times, and that gave us an advantage. I mentioned this earlier, but we had employees that have their CDLs and they were working primarily on the dock. And when we saw that positive inflection in volumes back in the third quarter, that was something that we were easily able to tap into and put those folks right back into a truck. So that worked to our advantage. We're running our truck driving schools right now to continue to produce more employees that have their CDLs, and will be available to drive as demand continues to improve. So that's why we're always trying to keep our focus on the long-term and be prepared for when the demand gets strong and we start seeing the levels of shipment growth like we've been able to experience in the past, back in 2021, we grew shipments per day at 19.5% at that year, our competition was up 4%. And we were able to accommodate that 19% shipment growth, and be able to keep our service metrics best-in-class and so forth. And it's that investment and trying to stay ahead of the curve with all the things that we do, with all three elements of capacity that allows us to put on significant levels of growth like that when the demand environment dictates. Not at this point. And again, we're trying to get ahead of it a little bit in the sense of creating some of our own drivers. But I think right now, just the state of the market overall, it's totally different than, compare and contrast to 2021, when things were so tight everywhere, and it was more of a challenge to get drivers. That's why we focus so much on keeping everyone that we could through the slow period, but go ahead and starting our schools back up, well ahead of the growth coming at us. We want to make sure that particularly with respect to drivers that we get ahead of it as best we can. Yes, I certainly think it's \u2013 the macro being in the state that it is, that helped the carriers absorb the freight that they were hauling before and pretty effectively. And \u2013 but like I mentioned, I think some of that freight has gone into some different modes and believe that, that will be short lived until really demand improves overall for transportation in general. But \u2013 now when it comes to pricing and just the yield improvement that we've had, we have incredibly strong yield performance in 2021, followed that up with 2022. And then our rev per hundredweight ex-fuel was up 8.1% this year. So some of that, like I mentioned, has been mix driven, but we've had really strong yield performance really over the last three years. But we've said even during that time, that our strategy is what it is. And we think it has worked for us. And when we operate at 72% for the year, I don't know that anyone else will be anywhere close to that. And so \u2013 but it's just a disciplined focus of keeping our costs as low as we can, and then pricing, understanding our cost on a per customer basis and then having a yield that makes sense to try to constantly improve the profitability on each customer account. But we've never said that, that was the right long-term rate. We just want to be consistent and be fair with our customers in that 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread of yield above cost has worked for us. But we were in a much different position than a lot of other carriers, I think, in terms of that long-term consistency that we've had in our pricing, we didn't have the same need to go out and try to take advantage of that market change and really increase rates in any way. We kept the same measured, fair approach. And I think that pays dividends. I think it is a reason why we've had good volume stability as well when we've gone through this last slow period, is that we've got good customer relationships. Freight at the end of the day is a relationship business, and so we want to continue to strengthen relationships and we've got an understanding with our customer base in terms of what we're trying to achieve. And you work through a slow year, we really didn't have any major customer losses. We didn't lose lanes from customers. We kept most of our large national accounts as we progress through the year, just the volume weakness was a result of \u2013 there were reduced orders for our customers' products. So pleased with the customer retention that we had last year and look forward to demand improves for our customers' products, we're in place and we'll be able to bring on that freight into the truck line. And get back to doing what we do best, which is growth. Well, we'll have the same approach that we always do. We start looking at what we think our cash from operations will be and then what we're going to spend with capital expenditures. And then we have the fixed dividend component. And the net cash balance, we target trying to return to shareholders through the buyback program. But we generally have a grid-based approach where we're buying more when the stock is lower, and I mean, less when it's higher, but consistently in the market. And I think that's what you've seen. But that $1.3 billion was double what we spent, about $600 million the year prior. And so it was reduced this year in the back half, in particular. But as we go into 2024, we'll just continue to look at how much free cash we think that we'll have and how much we try to return to shareholders and in what ways as we go through the year such that we don't obviously want too much cash building up on the balance sheet. But it's all about driving returns on invested capital, and we've done a pretty good job over time, with improving that metric. Thanks, Scott. I'm not sure that I fully understand your question, but like I mentioned before, that we anticipated that, that metric would eventually compress back to longer-term averages. And for us, it's 100 basis points to 150 basis points positive spread, which by the way, reconciles to the average operating ratio improvement, we've been able to generate over time as well. And so we'll continue to do our best to manage our cost and to continue to ask for necessary increases on our customer accounts to offset the cost inflation that we'll have in the business and to support the wage increases that we give to our employees to allow us to retain the employees that we have, but continue to attract new employees to our business as well, which we've been able to do over time to support the consistent growth that we've been able to produce. So it takes a lot to keep growing the company year in and year out. And to be able to keep our cost inflation as we're doing so as well. So try to keep that cost under control and keep asking for that same positive spread over time, that's what our focus is going to be. Well, we've probably got line of sight into adding four or five service centers. As Marty mentioned, we've got several that have been under construction. But a lot of that will really depend on the volume environment as well. In the past, we've finished service centers and may complete the construction, we have to start depreciating them and incurring other overhead-type costs with them, but if the volumes don't dictate the opening, then we might sort of keep them in ready reserve, if you will, and wait until volumes are stronger to start incurring the cost because with growth, that's another incremental cost, every new service center that we opened. You've got incremental line-haul cost and other expenses that we're going to incur as a result of that opening. In addition to just the general depreciation and overhead. So that will be something that we'll be mindful of as we go through the year. And hopefully, the volume environment will be such that we're ready to open them and turn them on day one as soon as we're finished."

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but we do ask in fairness to all that you please limit yourself to just one question at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marty Freeman. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Freeman: Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me today on the call is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's third quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. As a result, our shipment levels decreased on a year-over-year basis for the fifth straight quarter. Some encouraging trends developed during the quarter as our LTL shipments per day averaged 49,670 after averaging 47,077 per day for the first six months of the year. While a portion of this growth can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor, we believe we are winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The OD team effectively responded to this positive inflection in volumes by continuing to offer superior service at a fair price. We were pleased that our on-time performance was 99% during the quarter while our cargo claims ratio was 0.1%. As we have said many times before, service means much more than just picking up and delivering to our customers freight on-time and claims free. There are many other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier such as consistent transit times, carrier trustworthiness and ease of doing business. Mastio & Company conducts a comprehensive LTL study each year and they recently measured carriers on 28 different service and value-related attributes. Mastio published their 2023 results just this week and we are extremely proud to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 14th straight year. Logistic professionals ranked OD as number one for 25 of the 28 individual attributes in the most recent survey, which was our best performance ever and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. We believe the consistency and quality of our service over many years has validated by Mastio has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and supported our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our superior service also continues to support our ongoing yield management initiatives. We focus on obtaining consistent yield increases each year to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. Maintaining excess capacity during slower economic environments comes at a cost, but we believe having an available capacity for customers when they need it the most is critical element for our value proposition. As a result, we consistently invest in service center capacity, equipment, technology, and most importantly, our people. Because of these investments, we are well positioned to respond to the positive inflection in volumes during the quarter. It is important to note that while other carriers may have the ability to invest in service centers, equipment and technology, [indiscernible] family of employees that truly distinguishes us from our competition. We have a unique company culture that has defined who we are for a [indiscernible] for many years, delivering superior service at a fair price having a consistent approach to pricing and investing for growth may sound like a simple formula, but it takes a committed team to keep delivering on these fundamental elements for a long-term strategic plan. The execution by our team and consistency in our long-term financial results gives us a continued confidence in our strategic plan. We remain committed to this plan and believe we are better positioned than any other carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term. As we continue to deliver our unmatched value proposition to our customers over the long-term, we are confident that we can create further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and now, Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 5.5% in the third quarter of 2023 due to a 6.9% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by a 3.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. We also had one less operating day as compared to the third quarter 2022. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 8.0% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $3.09 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 8.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.6% and LTL shipments per day increasing 5.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 2.9% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.7% in tons per day, and an increase of 1.8% in shipments per day. As Marty just mentioned, a portion of this increase can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor as underlying demand has remained relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We do believe, however, that we are also winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows: July decreased 1.5% as compared with June, August increased 4.7% versus July and September increased 2.7% as compared to August. The 10-year average change for the respective months is a decrease of 3.1% in July, an increase of 0.1% in August and an increase of 3.6% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 1.5% to 2% when compared to October 2022, with a decrease of approximately 2% to 2.5% in our LTL tons per day. While our shipment levels for the month have been stronger than our normal sequential trend, we believe a portion of this outperformance is attributable to a cybersecurity incident disclosed by a competitor. We would expect some of the incremental growth in October will return to that competitor in November. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio increased 150 basis points to 70.6% as the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the improvement in our direct cost. While the decreasing revenue had a deleveraging effect on our cost categories that are more fixed in nature, we were pleased with the increase in operating efficiencies that helped drive the improvement in our direct cost. We also continued with our best efforts to control discretionary spending to minimize the increase in overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. We did, however, continue to execute on our 2023 capital expenditure plan to help ensure that we have the necessary capacity for anticipated growth once the domestic economy improves. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our depreciation expenses as a percent of revenue. That, along with the increase in employee benefit cost largely contributed to the overall increase in overhead expenses. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $429.2 million and $1.1 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While capital expenditures were $172 million and $651.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $65.9 million and $368.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While cash dividends totaled $43.7 million and $131.5 million for the same periods, our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2023 was 24.0% as compared to 23.9% in the third quarter 2022. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about the density improvement that you saw in the network? And any way to quantify that? And then maybe following that, just touch on how much excess capacity you have in the system today to take on some more volumes? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Our current level of excess capacity, which is in our service center network is now between 25% to 30%. We did improve density within our operations during the quarter and that was a big factor in driving the improvement in our direct operating costs, at least the improvement that we saw both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. But we leverage that inflection in the volumes and we always say long-term improvement in the operating ratio was driven by two key factors; density and yield and both generally support \u2013 or require the support of a macro economic environment is positive, but we had good leverage there that drove some nice operating efficiencies within our pickup delivery operations on the dock as well had improvement. We still had a slight decrease in our linehaul load factor, but that's improved from where we were earlier in the year. So all those factors contributed to the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the quarter.\nAllison Poliniak: Great. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: The next question is from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So I guess, Adam, as you think about the sequential progression into the fourth quarter, I know there are a lot of puts and takes with October and the disruption \u2013 the further disruption of the market in October. But could you maybe talk about your expectation for \u2013 or maybe how we should be thinking about operating ratio trends sequentially from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, all things considered?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Typically, the fourth quarter operating ratio is 200 basis points to 250 basis points worse than the third quarter. A couple of factors drive that. Usually, revenues a little bit softer. We give our wage increase the first of September, so we get three, four months within the quarter with that new wage rate, but multiple factors that generally are driving that change. One thing to note, we also do an actuarial assessment each year, we conduct that in the fourth quarter, and we normalize for that, just to assume it stays flat with the previous quarter, but we've seen adjustments in the past. That can be favorable, which is what we had last year as well as unfavorable. So assuming those costs stay different, I think that we can be in the 150 basis point to 200 basis point deterioration range, so slightly better than what we would historically see. Some of that, we're obviously starting the quarter out with a little favorability versus our normal sequential trend as we discussed. And so I think that we expect some volumes to kind of normalize, if you will, back to where they otherwise would have been for November and December. But that still gives us a little bit of a head start, and I think will help us drive a little bit of outperformance versus our normal trend there.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Good morning, everyone. So just maybe a 2024 question, if you will. It looks like yourselves and maybe a lot of the big LTLs still have a fair bit of excess capacity in their network even after absorbing the yellow volumes. I'm wondering how you think the kind of \u2013 how numbers will play out when the upcycle comes. Do you expect to see the market has suddenly tightened up and there to be like a rising tide of pricing? Or do you just think that you get better incremental margins as the volumes come in? Kind of where do you think the 2024 upcycle looks like in a post Yellow situation at this point?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think it's yet to be determined for 2024. Certainly, there's a lot of tea leaves that would suggest this could be a year of inflection. But we also believe the same thing we thought we were going to see a rebound in the spring of this year, so we're cautiously optimistic about what next year may bring. As we've said before, with the post Yellow situation, we want to be measured with our approach and continue to believe that slow and steady wins the race. So we didn't try to go out and immediately win as much share as was out there in the market, but we're trying to do it in the right way in leveraging the capacity that we have and not just the capacity and the service in the network, there's a people capacity element as well as equipment. And I don't know that there's as much capacity in the market, as you may have indicated with your question because we're hearing it every day. We're hearing about competitors that are missing pickups. They don't have the people part of the capacity equation solved and maybe took on too much freight and are starting to have negative implications from their overall service products. So we believe that we'll continue to win market share, but do it in the right way by giving superior service at a fair price to our customers and offering a value that's unmatched in our industry. And if we get some positive economic support, I think that you've seen in past cycles when we actually get there, 2018 and 2021 are good examples where we try to stay ahead of the growth curve with the capacity investments that we consistently make to be able to take on that volume when it's there. And when we look at those two years that I just referenced, we significantly outgrew the markets in those years despite the strength in underlying demand because of that excess capacity that we had in place.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChristian Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe I could piggyback on that a little bit. As we think about 2024, I know normally you guys talk about costs. You talked about price sort of relative to cost and be able to need to exceed that in any sort of normal year. I guess in post Yellow, as you think about 2024, do we need to see something else to be able to sort of spark a better-than-normal pricing year for you guys in 2024? I think there are expectations that next year naturally would be because of what happened with Yellow. But is a normal cyclical recovery enough to spark something that would be better than average? I just want to get your sort of general take on how sort of spring loaded or not you think the pricing environment is?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, sure. Well, I think the environment continues to be strong overall, especially given the supply shock that happened. But I think our approach is different from many of our competitors. We believe in a long-term consistent approach to pricing. And we try to target obtaining 100 basis points to 150 basis points of price above cost each year. We've had some cost pressure this year, and that's evident in our numbers. But I believe that, that starts improving as we go into next year, especially if we can get a little bit of volume recovery. We're already seeing the core inflation in our business moderating. It did in the third quarter. And I think that same trend can carry through in 4Q and into 2024 as well. But I think the market should certainly be conducive to us being able to obtain the increases that we believe we need to justify and cover our cost inflation, but also the investments that we're making in capacity. We're only a carrier that's really investing significantly in service center capacity. We've invested $2 billion over the last 10 years. And as a result, we've been able to increase our door capacity by 50%. And when you look at the public LTL companies at least, which are 65% to 70% of the market, overall capacity there is down close to 10%. And so I think that customers understand that and continue to give us the increases that we need that basically support the value proposition that we're able to offer them. When you think about the supply chain challenges and whatnot that shippers have had to work through over the last couple of years, in particular, capacity hasn't necessarily been at the forefront of the conversation over the last year, but over the last three, and it certainly has been critical. And so we feel like that's what we need to continue to focus on. But we'll continue with our same approach like we always have, and it's produced good things for us from a financial results standpoint, but an improvement in our balance sheet to support the ongoing investments that we believe we need to continue to make.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I want to ask about your perspective on share gains. So we've pulled forward, I guess, about 10 years of share gains from Yellow into a quarter. I guess do you think post Yellow, the pace of share gain for you guys in future years will be as good as what we've seen from you historically? And I guess I'm curious about this question in the context of this upcoming Yellow auction. I mean ultimately, I guess I want to know like how much \u2013 what is your strategy in terms of terminal growth? And how much do you want to add? Obviously, you were involved in the stalking-horse bid. What's the strategy here with this upcoming auction?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, we don't want to get into any details on that, just given the fact that it's ongoing, and we're continuing to evaluate those options. But our long-term strategic plan didn't depend on one competitor going out of business and us being able to obtain real estate from them. Our plan will continue to be \u2013 give superior service at a fair price. And service is what wins market share for us as well as having available capacity. Again, you look at the performance that we have with our volumes and market share in 2018, 2021, 10 points outperformance versus the industry. And that wasn't just Yellow that we were comparing against. It is the industry, so we win share from others. And I believe we've been able to capture more market share for the \u2013 when you look at the growth in the industry than anyone else as well. We've doubled our market share over the last 10 years that will require investment as we go forward. We expect that we'll continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenues each year on capital expenditures. That will continue to be within real estate and with equipment to support our anticipated growth, but we certainly believe that we can be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years, just like we have over the past 10 because of the value offering that we have, just validated by Mastio this week. We've won this award 14 years in a row. We're very proud. We had better performance than we've ever had in the survey, winning 25 of the 28 attributes that they measure. And our overall gap between us and the industry widened out further than it's ever been. So we feel good about where we are, but we're also focused on making sure that our service continuously improves as we go forward, and that's what will be key to our ability to win share.\nScott Group: So if I understand, Adam, you don't think that like your long-term volume growth share gain is any different going forward post Yellow?\nAdam Satterfield: Not at all. I don't think the formula changes just because they're not here and they're 45,000, 50,000 shipments, whatever it was, is now dispersed. And that share is somewhat with us, somewhat with other carriers. I think there's probably an element of it that went into the truckload world as well that probably will, at some point, be rebalanced within LTL once the truckload world tightens up. That's yet to be seen, but trying to trace the number of shipments they had versus at least what the public carriers have disclosed, there's a missing element there that I believe may have landed in the truckload world. But for us, the conversations that we have with customers, the long-term trends that we think will support growth in the LTL industry, be it continued improvement with e-commerce trends, that's conducing to moving freight by LTL, whether we see increased manufacturing, at least in North America, a lot of those things will be more conducive to freight moving by LTL for which there's no one in the industry that is delivering the same type of service and value that we can offer customers. And so that's what we'll remain focused on. We've got to continue to focus on managing our cost inflation, and we focused particularly on that as well. So we can continue to have that 100 basis point to 150 basis point price versus cost spread keeping our prices relative to the industry. But certainly, when you think about the overall value equation, there's no one that we believe can match what we can offer a shipper.\nScott Group: I appreciate the thought. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, Marty. Hi, Adam. I had two questions, if that's okay. So first question, you just did like a 70 and change OR in a broad freight environment that's pretty weak, to say the least. Does that \u2013 that obviously informs the opportunity in a broadly better freight environment? I know you have the [indiscernible] OR target, but I was wondering if you can update us that because I assume you're quite happy and impressed with the resiliency of the OR and what has been a weak market even including Yellow. And then I want to push back a little bit on the Mastio. Obviously, you guys on a headline basis, have been exceptional. And I know it's really hard to get that number one national carrier position. But the value proposition for OD historically has been, yes, we're more expensive. But on a total cost basis, we're still better because of our claims ratio and our on-time performance. And you guys always were in the middle or below that fair value band in the Mastio survey. Today, you're kind of at the tippy top. And it's hard to improve 99% service, 0.1% claims ratio, but your price is going up, which on the margin reduces the value that you provide to the market, which may explain some of the market share. I'm sure you disagree with this, but help me understand how you think about moving up towards the very top of the fair value band and what that means for your market share opportunity going forward?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, there's always going to be movement there. And what we've got to go by is not necessarily that data. That data is very important, and we pay a lot of attention to it, but it's the conversations we have every day with customers. And the conversations when we go back to post pandemic when someone may have moved freight away from us because of price and trying to save a little bit, but if they were in jeopardy of losing a customer because the freight never got picked up or it never got delivered, then there's a premium there for sure. If your product is not on the shelf available for sale, if you've got a production line that shut down, waiting on a part or a piece, I think shippers are looking more strategically at value. That seems to be the outcome post pandemic world. And anytime we go through a slow environment like we've been for the last year, there can be some movement within some of those categories. But for us, trying to have a consistent approach to pricing each year, being able to sit across the table from a customer and have an open, honest conversation about being fair to us and being fair to them is what we strive for. And to be able to make the investments that we're doing, like I said earlier, capacity may not have been at the top of mind over the last year because of the overall weakness in underlying demand. And then you had a couple of carriers earlier this year that were making some changes and doing some different things with respect to their pricing. So those are things that you always have that are challenges that you manage through. But that environment changes pretty quickly. And keep reference in 2021, that was a period where competitors were increasing rates faster than us where they're more up playing the market plan versus having a consistent approach. And all of a sudden, we look like a lot better value, if you will, when our service is way ahead on the spectrum. But now that someone has closed that pricing gap because they've come in and taken the 10%, 15% type of rate increase, that's what drives market share to us, and it's market share that stays sticky. We have had great continuity within our large accounts when we look at our top national accounts. We don't have turnover in that business over the past 12 months. We've not lost accounts or lost lanes just in many cases, that the demand environment has been weaker. So demand for our customers' products, if you will. They've not been able to tender as much freight to us. So it's something that we always are relevant and mindful of where our pricing is relative to others. But we do what we need to do and what makes sense for us. That's part of our long-term strategic plan and we just make sure we communicate what our needs are going to be with customers. And it's a model that's worked. We've been able to grow our revenues 11% to 12% on average each year over the past 10 years. And that's the same formula that we want to be able to work as we move forward. It's consistent and it sounds like a simple plan, but there's a lot of complexities behind the scenes, if you will. And we just want to keep executing and believe we can. And I think that as we go through the next 12 months, if we see some real economic recovery, I think that we'll see our numbers continue to outperform from a growth standpoint than the industry, just like we've seen in prior cycles.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Adam, you're able to handle this surge of 3Q business without really changing the cost structure that much. So as we think about kind of a return to cyclical recovery at some point next year, whether it's first half or back half loaded, did this surge in volume in the third quarter and October absorb a lot of your spare capacity and a lot of the ability to have the incremental margin expansion, so as you can see the volume recovery on a more sticky basis, you can still increase the cost structure on a lesser one-for-one basis and get that historical OR improvement? Or is there going to be a bit of a catch-up where you're going to have to add more labor, more resources if the broader demand tailwind actually accelerates next year?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, we were in a great spot coming in to this quarter from a labor standpoint, from an equipment standpoint and definitely from a service center standpoint, and we've intentionally been heavy. We've tried to protect as many driver positions in particular that we could as we've gone through this slow period. We certainly have seen some attrition within our workforce over the past year. But we've tried to keep as many people on board as we could, knowing that the inflection would individually happened. We believe that it was going to happen earlier in the year. And obviously, we're disappointed when it didn't, but we just continue to try to manage through. And here we are. It did happen in the manner that we thought that it would, but we were well positioned to respond and our existing workforce has been able to do so. Now from here, we have restarted the hiring process in some locations. And we'll continue to run our internal truck driving schools to produce new drivers and have them available as the demand levels dictate. If our shipment volumes continue to increase, if we can see sequential improvement through next year. We want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to be able to deal with it and not be playing from behind, if you will, and having to try to catch it or not being able to say yes to a customer if they're coming to us and asking if we can handle incremental volumes for them. So it's always a challenge to try to walk that tightrope in terms of managing the elements of capacity. But I think that we did a great job with getting through it this year and we may have carried a little extra cost in doing so. But I think our operating ratio has performed about where we thought it would, given the decrease in volumes. We said earlier in the year that our focus would be to managing our direct cost even in a low volume environment. We've been able to do so without any sacrifice whatsoever to our service quality. In fact, some of our service metrics have actually improved as we've gone through this year. So we're pleased with where our service quality is, the performance of our team, the improving efficiencies that we're seeing. We'll continue to add to the team and continue to rebalance our fleet as well. As we go through 2024, we've still got some deferred replacements that \u2013 where we want to improve the average age of our fleet. But all of that will continue to be worked out as we go through the next year or so. And we want to get back to a growth environment, improving operating ratio environment, all those things we're kind of used to seeing, we just need a little cooperation from the economy to help us along the way.\nJonathan Chappell: Got it. Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes. Good morning. Adam, you've talked a bit about \u2013 I think you said like inflation can come down somewhat next year. And then you've talked a bit about price as well, and you've seen a pretty constructive view on where price is going to be next year. If we don't see improvement in the freight market activity, do you think you'd be looking at those two factors supporting margin improvement because it seems like you put those two together, you would see the margin improve. But how do you think about, I guess, lower inflation and a favorable price and what that does for margin, even if you don't see freight improve?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that we had \u2013 for one thing, we had a pretty hefty CapEx year this year. And when you look at our operating ratio and the change that we have in the third quarter, that was a bit of a headwind, 110 basis points headwind on the depreciation side and some of the CapEx was basically related to what's happened over the last couple of years with the OEM challenges that we've had, shortages of parts that have required us to carry maybe a little bit more equipment on the books than we would sort of look at from an \u2013 if we were optimizing the fleet standpoint. So I think as we go through next year, if it looks like it's going to be another flattish year, we're already sort of a leg up, if you will. A lot of times, you can take September volumes for the month and kind of just use that to correlate to what the next year's volumes will be. And so we might be looking at even if it's underlying demand doesn't change at all. We believe that we've got the opportunity to win some of the share that we continue to believe will be turning around over the next six months to a year given some of the service issues that I referenced earlier, we're hearing about every day. But we're already in a position where we might see a little bit of volume growth. And then get some yield on top of that, that in an environment where cost may be improving as well. Then yes, that's the environment where in the past, we've been able to produce some operating ratio improvement.\nThomas Wadewitz: So I mean it sounds like you feel pretty good about where you're at in 2024, even if you don't see a lot of improvement in the freight market?\nAdam Satterfield: I think so. I mean, we're certainly \u2013 we saw the step-up basically in August. And then I was pleased with the performance that we had in September. And when we talked about post the mid-quarter update, where we were from a shipments per day standpoint, we had been at 47,000 shipments per day since December of last year. And basically, that average carried forward through July. We saw that step up. We've talked about kind of an incremental 3,000 shipments per day, and that's where we were in August. In September, normally, it's a 2.5% to 3% increase in shipments per day would be normal seasonality. Although the last month of the first quarter and the second quarter we saw a little bit of a pickup, but nothing close to where normal seasonality would be. That's kind of where we've been missing some of the growth over the last year, but our shipments per day were up 2.1%. So that performed a lot better than what we've been seeing at least in the last month of the quarter, and that really was no new impact. That's just some share shift and then existing customers that are giving us more freight, if you will. So there's been a lot obviously going on over the last four months within the industry, some things obviously permanent. And then like we mentioned, I believe that we'll see some of the volume gain that we had in October that will return to a competitor. So trying to kind of figure out where the daily shipment count gets to in November and December is a little difficult. But if things kind of shake out, if we had just normalized, if you will, and we're more along normal seasonal patterns, we would have been in an environment where \u2013 or if we get back to that from November, December, rather, to where our shipment counts are more flattish, with where we were last year in the fourth quarter and revenue is probably becoming more flattish as well versus being down 5.5% in the third quarter. It may still be down slightly, but it's getting \u2013 everything is kind of getting back to flattish. And I think that, that's a good position to build on as we go into 2024. Hopefully, we'll continue to see some more of those share gains, like I mentioned, just service related. And then if we can get a little bit of help from the economy, then that would build on even more volumes and then we'll just continue to execute, like I said earlier, on the volume side and managing costs. And if we can have that positive delta there, then that's a good setup even if underlying demand is not significantly changing. If it does, and we're not going to precall it like we did last year. But if it does, then that's the type of environment where I think our model shines the brightest when competitors are at capacity issues, and we believe that's happening just based on customer feedback today, then that's when we can really put on the incremental volumes that we build our network up to be prepared for. And so that possibility is out there, but a lot depends on what we may see from an overall economic standpoint.\nThomas Wadewitz: Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the perspective, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi. Spoke quite a bit about price on the call today. I'm just curious on mix and the types of shipments you're getting, obviously, weight per shipment, maybe discussing that, which is basically trended down, sort of thoughts around that and shipment mix? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Our weight per shipment has trended down and really it went down, I guess, in August to about 1,485 pounds, and that was some of that incremental freight that we saw that pickup of about 3,000 shipments per day. Increased a little bit in September, which you'd expect, and we're kind of hanging around that 1,485 pound range here in October as well. So that's something where I believe we're kind of at a baseline, reflecting kind of the underlying freight that's in our book right now. And that will be a metric to watch to see are there increased orders for widgets, does that 1,485 pounds \u2013 do we see that grow to 1,500 to 1,520 pounds getting back closer to the 1,600 pound range that we've seen in robust economies. So it's \u2013 like anything, the freight that you take on as long as you understand the handling characteristics and what the pricing ought to be, that decrease in weight per shipment did have a little bit of a favorable impact on our yield metrics during the quarter. But that's what we have built our business on is investing heavily in all the tools and technologies to understand the freight that we're moving to make sure that we're moving everything profitably with the right pricing in place. And I think that we've made those adjustments to the incremental freight that we've seen thus far.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to come back to the near-term. I think for September, you said tonnage was about one point below average seasonality on a sequential basis. But you have confidence you're gaining market share and underlying demand on study. So just wondering if you can clarify that and maybe if you're seeing any attrition from the initial wave of share shifts. I guess kind of along the lines of an earlier question, just wondering how any new customers you have from this are responding to your premium service but also premium price offering?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We \u2013 from a tonnage standpoint, the sequential increase in September from August was up 2.7%, the 10-year average change is a 3.6% increase. So \u2013 but that compares favorably to what our performance has been in the third month of the first few quarters of the year, was the point that I was making. We've seen a little bit stronger pickup in September coming to us versus what we had seen earlier in the year and really no new events, if you will, within the industry that were driving any of that change, just a continuation of some of that freight that had to move at the end of July, we had made the point on the last call that obviously, shippers had to find an immediate home for that freight, and they likely leverage the existing carriers that they had in their networks or at least the large national accounts did. But we believe in and continue to believe that there's going to be some share shifting around. But I think that especially as we go through the fourth quarter, the first quarter of next year, two periods that are seasonally slower during the year is probably the type of environment that shippers will be looking at their overall supply chain partners and figuring out what's the right solution to have. And so I think that we'll see some churn that will be happening over the next six months. I think that there are probably some customers that were at competitors previously that are taking on margin increases right now at a time when their service is probably deteriorating, that it will also be looking at the value that OD can provide. And those are the types of accounts that we've seen in prior periods. It's obviously, the situation is different, but I think it could be very similar to 2021. That environment was just all demand-driven, but demand was incredibly strong. There is tremendous opportunity there from a volume standpoint. And a lot of the competitors simply couldn't take on the incremental volumes because they didn't have all the elements of capacity in place to be able to do so. And they're missing pickups, They're not able to get the freight that they do pick up, delivered on time. And those are the types of customers that increasingly call on Old Dominion. And we're starting to have some of those same types of conversations, maybe not at the same level at this point, but we're having those same conversations today. And we think that, that will create some incremental volume opportunity for us as we progress through the next few quarters.\nEric Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Hoexter: Hey, great. Good morning, Marty and Adam. So the market, obviously, at 30x earnings, taking this a little bit in stride here this morning, maybe it's because the 2%, 2.5% downtick in October, maybe some of the SDs give back expectations. But I guess maybe the expectation was for faster growth and that you'd be able to keep the OR, yet you're talking about more measured growth. So I just want to dig into this. There was a great discussion with Scott earlier into your outlook and your thoughts on sustained growth. But maybe thoughts about the industry and the competitive nature of it, right? So if you've got this bid process on the service centers coming up, which means the capacity just goes elsewhere, it doesn't go away. And maybe everybody thought it was going to go away and that would enable you to continue to take that share. Maybe your thoughts on what does that lack of tightening, right, if more of that capacity spills out to the market on your ability to take that? And I know, Adam, you couldn't give your thoughts on it, but maybe just give the factual stuff, maybe the timing of the service center bids, just so we're all on top of the exact nature of the distribution of those?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think over the next few weeks, bids will be due. And so I think a lot will be determined, obviously, in the next month or so and figuring out who may end up with some of those service centers. I still believe that some of that capacity will be leaving the industry overall. But the reality is all of those shipments that were in place before, it's been several months now. They found a new home. And so if you\u2019re \u2013 someone on the strategic side that might be investing, you've got to look and think about how that would make sense, how much incremental capacity do you want to buy that you would have to go out and how would you use it kind of thing. And so those are some of the thoughts that in considerations that I'm sure that we have and that others have as well. But again, from our standpoint, we believe we continue to grow. We will continue to invest in one shape or form, whether it's trying to go back after some of these properties in that bid or if it's something totally independent, which was the path that we were on before they closed their doors. Either way, I think when we think about the long-term, and that's the lens that we try to view our business through, we believe we will be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years because of the quality of service that we offer and the value offering that we have in place. That's going to require investment. Just because you invest doesn't mean you're going to go win share. And if someone does, then it's probably increasing their cost basis. And that could be a good thing for us as well if our competitors' costs are increasing, requiring them to increase rates, even further and maybe closing some of that price gap that exists between us and others. So I think that we tried to say on the last quarter call that our approach is going to be more slow and steady, if you will in this environment where underlying demand is \u2013 continues to remain relatively consistent. We've not seen any type of true inflection in the economy at this point and we're prepared for it when it happens. And I think we've seen some really strong performance in the past when we get into those types of strong demand environment. So we're ready for it from thinking about all elements of capacity. It's more than just service centers. Service centers drive what can be done over the long-term, but you got to have people and equipment as well. And we feel good about where we are with all elements of capacity and our ability to respond to growth when it comes to us, and it will. It's just a matter of time before it comes. And so we'll be ready when that time does come.\nKenneth Hoexter: Thanks, Adam. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: You talked earlier about starting to invest again in headcount and get ready for some of the growth that may come next year. Can you give us an update about where you are versus your capacity on facilities, people and equipment now? And any thoughts about where those constraints are showing up first, be it regionally or in functionally? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We're \u2013 on the service center side, we're at about 25% to 30% excess capacity. We'll necessarily look at those other two pieces of the capacity equation in the same type of way. But our equipment, we're in really good shape with where we are, probably a little bit heavy steel even with the influx of volume that we've seen over the last few months. But like I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to go through and evaluate and optimize that as we look at what our 2024 CapEx plan might be. We've not formulated that at this point, and we'll talk about it on the next earnings call. But what the fleet size should look like given whatever our baseline forecast for 2024 might be. And then we always look at kind of a bull case scenario and a bear case scenario as well to make sure that we've got an operating plan that can meet if we were to see really strong growth or the growth, not necessarily at the levels that our baseline indicated. On the people side, obviously, we've been able to step up and meet the incremental volumes. Our people are getting more work, which I think makes them happy per se. And we had drivers that we're working on the dock and combo type of roles. So we're able to leverage that, putting those employees right back into a truck. And so overall, I think we're in a really great spot with all elements. But it will require, as we get into next year, we do see some incremental growth from where we are now will require investment in our people. And that's why we've restarted some of our truck driving schools, and we are hiring in certain locations as well for new drivers, employees on the platform that are moving the freight on their docks as well. So we will continue to add to the workforce, if you will, as we make our best efforts to match the capacity of our workforce with the shipment levels that we sort of see coming at us, but making sure that they're on board ahead of the curve, so they're properly trained especially on the dock that we make sure that we're maximizing our load factor. We're using our claims prevention tools to keep that cargo claims ratio where it is at 0.1%, all those things are important. But you can't just throw a person right into an environment where we're growing double digits kind of thing. They're just not going to be as efficient or as effective as we probably otherwise won't. So we try to invest ahead of the curve, if you will, for that reason, to make sure that we get appropriate training in place before we really see the growth.\nBascome Majors: Thank you for that, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Adam, maybe just want to follow-up on some of your comments on the commercial side. You've got a couple of competitors out there that are targeting that field accounts business. I want to ask you if you feel like you have the right mix of field national and 3PL at this point or things are kind of changing post Yellow. And then just quickly on the sales force, any additions that have happened there to maybe fill out the newer parts of the network and keep pushing on that share growth? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I feel like our \u2013 we've got a great sales team in place that national account team and local field sales that have been working hard over the last year in terms of continuing to build relationships, staying in front of our customers, letting them know that we're here when they need us, and our team work hand in hand with our pricing and costing groups as well. And I think that, that coordination and symmetry that we have there, is evident when you look at our long-term success and our financial results. But we \u2013 about one-third of our business does come by way of 3PLs. We've actually seen a little bit of improvement there. In the third quarter, we had a little bit of growth with the accounts that are within that 3PL book of business just ever so slightly, but at least it was in the green when the overall book of business, the overall revenue was down 5.5% for the quarter, so that was good to see. That was an area of weakness, in particular in the first quarter, where a few carriers, we're putting some lower transaction type pricing in place. And I think that market firmed up pretty quickly in the end of July. So some of that business is starting to come back to us and hopefully, that can be a continuing trend as well. But we've got a great mix of our contract business and continue to grow with our small mom-and-pop accounts as well. And the 3PLs, we see opportunity within all of those categories really and our sales team will continue to leverage that and hopefully be ready for a good growth year in 2024.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning and thank you. I'll keep it easy here and cheat and just essentially re-ask Amit\u2019s first question. Given the 70s and change OR you saw in the current quarter and what is admittedly still a pretty weak freight environment. And also, I think you called out pretty well on this call, which is to spend your own kind of elevated expenses in 2023. Maybe just how the dynamics over the last couple of months change the timing of achieving that kind of six handle OR target just as you balance this obvious major industry events as well as your own kind of moderated growth and capacity investment strategy? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. It's \u2013 when we laid out the goal to have a sub-70 annual operating ratio, we didn't put a timeframe per se on that because we felt like we might go through \u2013 and a macro environment that's a little bit weaker, and we didn't want to be beholden to some artificial timeline and do things that were more short-term focused versus long-term. And I think when you look at this year, in particular, to have a capital expenditure plan of $720 million in an environment where at one point, we were \u2013 our tonnage was down double digits shows the focus that we try to take on looking out in the long-term and being ready for future growth. And that comes at a cost, and we've seen that increase in the operating ratio this year as a result. And again, the depreciation is probably the biggest drag that we have right now, but that's something that when you look at it on the other hand, when volumes come back, that's where we get leverage. And I've been pleased with the cost performance on the direct cost side. In the third quarter, our direct costs were 51% to 51.5% of overall revenue while our overhead came in at about 19.5% of revenue, and that compares to last year, our overhead was 16.5% to 17%, so deterioration there. But once we get back to the volume environment, we should be able to leverage that completely and get right back to improving our operating ratio, so we're already closed. We've done a couple of quarters with the second and third quarters of last year with 69 something operating ratio. And typically, when we look back through prior years, when we've gone through an environment where volumes have been down, revenue was down, we've lost a little bit on the operating ratio because of that leverage opportunity, we've been able to recover any OR loss in the subsequent year when we've had revenue recovery. And I think that's certainly what we're focused on and believe can happen. So we'll see where that gets us by the time we get to the end of 2024, but we will continue to perform on the direct cost side and continue to look for areas of opportunity as we can drive efficiency within our operations. But trying to get some leverage there on the overhead side, potentially not having to invest as much in 2024, and if we can get some revenue growth going along with that, could potentially produce a beautiful thing when you start looking at that OR.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks.\nKevin Freeman: Thank you all today for your participation.

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me today on the call is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's third quarter financial results reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. As a result, our shipment levels decreased on a year-over-year basis for the fifth straight quarter. Some encouraging trends developed during the quarter as our LTL shipments per day averaged 49,670 after averaging 47,077 per day for the first six months of the year. While a portion of this growth can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor, we believe we are winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The OD team effectively responded to this positive inflection in volumes by continuing to offer superior service at a fair price. We were pleased that our on-time performance was 99% during the quarter while our cargo claims ratio was 0.1%. As we have said many times before, service means much more than just picking up and delivering to our customers freight on-time and claims free. There are many other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier such as consistent transit times, carrier trustworthiness and ease of doing business. Mastio & Company conducts a comprehensive LTL study each year and they recently measured carriers on 28 different service and value-related attributes. Mastio published their 2023 results just this week and we are extremely proud to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 14th straight year. Logistic professionals ranked OD as number one for 25 of the 28 individual attributes in the most recent survey, which was our best performance ever and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to excellence and customer satisfaction. We believe the consistency and quality of our service over many years has validated by Mastio has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and supported our ability to win market share over the long-term. Our superior service also continues to support our ongoing yield management initiatives. We focus on obtaining consistent yield increases each year to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in capacity and technology. Maintaining excess capacity during slower economic environments comes at a cost, but we believe having an available capacity for customers when they need it the most is critical element for our value proposition. As a result, we consistently invest in service center capacity, equipment, technology, and most importantly, our people. Because of these investments, we are well positioned to respond to the positive inflection in volumes during the quarter. It is important to note that while other carriers may have the ability to invest in service centers, equipment and technology, [indiscernible] family of employees that truly distinguishes us from our competition. We have a unique company culture that has defined who we are for a [indiscernible] for many years, delivering superior service at a fair price having a consistent approach to pricing and investing for growth may sound like a simple formula, but it takes a committed team to keep delivering on these fundamental elements for a long-term strategic plan. The execution by our team and consistency in our long-term financial results gives us a continued confidence in our strategic plan. We remain committed to this plan and believe we are better positioned than any other carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term. As we continue to deliver our unmatched value proposition to our customers over the long-term, we are confident that we can create further profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and now, Adam will discuss our third quarter financial results in greater detail. Thank you all today for your participation. We appreciate your questions, and please feel free to give us a call later if you have anything further. Hope you all have a great day."

            "name": "Adam Satterfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 5.5% in the third quarter of 2023 due to a 6.9% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by a 3.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. We also had one less operating day as compared to the third quarter 2022. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 8.0% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $3.09 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the third quarter increased 8.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.6% and LTL shipments per day increasing 5.7%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 2.9% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.7% in tons per day, and an increase of 1.8% in shipments per day. As Marty just mentioned, a portion of this increase can be attributed to the loss of one large competitor as underlying demand has remained relatively consistent throughout the quarter. We do believe, however, that we are also winning new business from other carriers in the industry due to the quality of our service and overall value provided to our customers. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows: July decreased 1.5% as compared with June, August increased 4.7% versus July and September increased 2.7% as compared to August. The 10-year average change for the respective months is a decrease of 3.1% in July, an increase of 0.1% in August and an increase of 3.6% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 1.5% to 2% when compared to October 2022, with a decrease of approximately 2% to 2.5% in our LTL tons per day. While our shipment levels for the month have been stronger than our normal sequential trend, we believe a portion of this outperformance is attributable to a cybersecurity incident disclosed by a competitor. We would expect some of the incremental growth in October will return to that competitor in November. As usual, we will provide actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our third quarter operating ratio increased 150 basis points to 70.6% as the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue more than offset the improvement in our direct cost. While the decreasing revenue had a deleveraging effect on our cost categories that are more fixed in nature, we were pleased with the increase in operating efficiencies that helped drive the improvement in our direct cost. We also continued with our best efforts to control discretionary spending to minimize the increase in overhead expenses as a percent of revenue. We did, however, continue to execute on our 2023 capital expenditure plan to help ensure that we have the necessary capacity for anticipated growth once the domestic economy improves. This resulted in a 110 basis point increase in our depreciation expenses as a percent of revenue. That, along with the increase in employee benefit cost largely contributed to the overall increase in overhead expenses. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $429.2 million and $1.1 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While capital expenditures were $172 million and $651.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $65.9 million and $368.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. While cash dividends totaled $43.7 million and $131.5 million for the same periods, our effective tax rate for the third quarter 2023 was 24.0% as compared to 23.9% in the third quarter 2022. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Sure. Our current level of excess capacity, which is in our service center network is now between 25% to 30%. We did improve density within our operations during the quarter and that was a big factor in driving the improvement in our direct operating costs, at least the improvement that we saw both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. But we leverage that inflection in the volumes and we always say long-term improvement in the operating ratio was driven by two key factors; density and yield and both generally support \u2013 or require the support of a macro economic environment is positive, but we had good leverage there that drove some nice operating efficiencies within our pickup delivery operations on the dock as well had improvement. We still had a slight decrease in our linehaul load factor, but that's improved from where we were earlier in the year. So all those factors contributed to the improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue during the quarter. Sure. Typically, the fourth quarter operating ratio is 200 basis points to 250 basis points worse than the third quarter. A couple of factors drive that. Usually, revenues a little bit softer. We give our wage increase the first of September, so we get three, four months within the quarter with that new wage rate, but multiple factors that generally are driving that change. One thing to note, we also do an actuarial assessment each year, we conduct that in the fourth quarter, and we normalize for that, just to assume it stays flat with the previous quarter, but we've seen adjustments in the past. That can be favorable, which is what we had last year as well as unfavorable. So assuming those costs stay different, I think that we can be in the 150 basis point to 200 basis point deterioration range, so slightly better than what we would historically see. Some of that, we're obviously starting the quarter out with a little favorability versus our normal sequential trend as we discussed. And so I think that we expect some volumes to kind of normalize, if you will, back to where they otherwise would have been for November and December. But that still gives us a little bit of a head start, and I think will help us drive a little bit of outperformance versus our normal trend there. Well, I think it's yet to be determined for 2024. Certainly, there's a lot of tea leaves that would suggest this could be a year of inflection. But we also believe the same thing we thought we were going to see a rebound in the spring of this year, so we're cautiously optimistic about what next year may bring. As we've said before, with the post Yellow situation, we want to be measured with our approach and continue to believe that slow and steady wins the race. So we didn't try to go out and immediately win as much share as was out there in the market, but we're trying to do it in the right way in leveraging the capacity that we have and not just the capacity and the service in the network, there's a people capacity element as well as equipment. And I don't know that there's as much capacity in the market, as you may have indicated with your question because we're hearing it every day. We're hearing about competitors that are missing pickups. They don't have the people part of the capacity equation solved and maybe took on too much freight and are starting to have negative implications from their overall service products. So we believe that we'll continue to win market share, but do it in the right way by giving superior service at a fair price to our customers and offering a value that's unmatched in our industry. And if we get some positive economic support, I think that you've seen in past cycles when we actually get there, 2018 and 2021 are good examples where we try to stay ahead of the growth curve with the capacity investments that we consistently make to be able to take on that volume when it's there. And when we look at those two years that I just referenced, we significantly outgrew the markets in those years despite the strength in underlying demand because of that excess capacity that we had in place. Yes, sure. Well, I think the environment continues to be strong overall, especially given the supply shock that happened. But I think our approach is different from many of our competitors. We believe in a long-term consistent approach to pricing. And we try to target obtaining 100 basis points to 150 basis points of price above cost each year. We've had some cost pressure this year, and that's evident in our numbers. But I believe that, that starts improving as we go into next year, especially if we can get a little bit of volume recovery. We're already seeing the core inflation in our business moderating. It did in the third quarter. And I think that same trend can carry through in 4Q and into 2024 as well. But I think the market should certainly be conducive to us being able to obtain the increases that we believe we need to justify and cover our cost inflation, but also the investments that we're making in capacity. We're only a carrier that's really investing significantly in service center capacity. We've invested $2 billion over the last 10 years. And as a result, we've been able to increase our door capacity by 50%. And when you look at the public LTL companies at least, which are 65% to 70% of the market, overall capacity there is down close to 10%. And so I think that customers understand that and continue to give us the increases that we need that basically support the value proposition that we're able to offer them. When you think about the supply chain challenges and whatnot that shippers have had to work through over the last couple of years, in particular, capacity hasn't necessarily been at the forefront of the conversation over the last year, but over the last three, and it certainly has been critical. And so we feel like that's what we need to continue to focus on. But we'll continue with our same approach like we always have, and it's produced good things for us from a financial results standpoint, but an improvement in our balance sheet to support the ongoing investments that we believe we need to continue to make. Well, we don't want to get into any details on that, just given the fact that it's ongoing, and we're continuing to evaluate those options. But our long-term strategic plan didn't depend on one competitor going out of business and us being able to obtain real estate from them. Our plan will continue to be \u2013 give superior service at a fair price. And service is what wins market share for us as well as having available capacity. Again, you look at the performance that we have with our volumes and market share in 2018, 2021, 10 points outperformance versus the industry. And that wasn't just Yellow that we were comparing against. It is the industry, so we win share from others. And I believe we've been able to capture more market share for the \u2013 when you look at the growth in the industry than anyone else as well. We've doubled our market share over the last 10 years that will require investment as we go forward. We expect that we'll continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenues each year on capital expenditures. That will continue to be within real estate and with equipment to support our anticipated growth, but we certainly believe that we can be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years, just like we have over the past 10 because of the value offering that we have, just validated by Mastio this week. We've won this award 14 years in a row. We're very proud. We had better performance than we've ever had in the survey, winning 25 of the 28 attributes that they measure. And our overall gap between us and the industry widened out further than it's ever been. So we feel good about where we are, but we're also focused on making sure that our service continuously improves as we go forward, and that's what will be key to our ability to win share. Not at all. I don't think the formula changes just because they're not here and they're 45,000, 50,000 shipments, whatever it was, is now dispersed. And that share is somewhat with us, somewhat with other carriers. I think there's probably an element of it that went into the truckload world as well that probably will, at some point, be rebalanced within LTL once the truckload world tightens up. That's yet to be seen, but trying to trace the number of shipments they had versus at least what the public carriers have disclosed, there's a missing element there that I believe may have landed in the truckload world. But for us, the conversations that we have with customers, the long-term trends that we think will support growth in the LTL industry, be it continued improvement with e-commerce trends, that's conducing to moving freight by LTL, whether we see increased manufacturing, at least in North America, a lot of those things will be more conducive to freight moving by LTL for which there's no one in the industry that is delivering the same type of service and value that we can offer customers. And so that's what we'll remain focused on. We've got to continue to focus on managing our cost inflation, and we focused particularly on that as well. So we can continue to have that 100 basis point to 150 basis point price versus cost spread keeping our prices relative to the industry. But certainly, when you think about the overall value equation, there's no one that we believe can match what we can offer a shipper. Well, there's always going to be movement there. And what we've got to go by is not necessarily that data. That data is very important, and we pay a lot of attention to it, but it's the conversations we have every day with customers. And the conversations when we go back to post pandemic when someone may have moved freight away from us because of price and trying to save a little bit, but if they were in jeopardy of losing a customer because the freight never got picked up or it never got delivered, then there's a premium there for sure. If your product is not on the shelf available for sale, if you've got a production line that shut down, waiting on a part or a piece, I think shippers are looking more strategically at value. That seems to be the outcome post pandemic world. And anytime we go through a slow environment like we've been for the last year, there can be some movement within some of those categories. But for us, trying to have a consistent approach to pricing each year, being able to sit across the table from a customer and have an open, honest conversation about being fair to us and being fair to them is what we strive for. And to be able to make the investments that we're doing, like I said earlier, capacity may not have been at the top of mind over the last year because of the overall weakness in underlying demand. And then you had a couple of carriers earlier this year that were making some changes and doing some different things with respect to their pricing. So those are things that you always have that are challenges that you manage through. But that environment changes pretty quickly. And keep reference in 2021, that was a period where competitors were increasing rates faster than us where they're more up playing the market plan versus having a consistent approach. And all of a sudden, we look like a lot better value, if you will, when our service is way ahead on the spectrum. But now that someone has closed that pricing gap because they've come in and taken the 10%, 15% type of rate increase, that's what drives market share to us, and it's market share that stays sticky. We have had great continuity within our large accounts when we look at our top national accounts. We don't have turnover in that business over the past 12 months. We've not lost accounts or lost lanes just in many cases, that the demand environment has been weaker. So demand for our customers' products, if you will. They've not been able to tender as much freight to us. So it's something that we always are relevant and mindful of where our pricing is relative to others. But we do what we need to do and what makes sense for us. That's part of our long-term strategic plan and we just make sure we communicate what our needs are going to be with customers. And it's a model that's worked. We've been able to grow our revenues 11% to 12% on average each year over the past 10 years. And that's the same formula that we want to be able to work as we move forward. It's consistent and it sounds like a simple plan, but there's a lot of complexities behind the scenes, if you will. And we just want to keep executing and believe we can. And I think that as we go through the next 12 months, if we see some real economic recovery, I think that we'll see our numbers continue to outperform from a growth standpoint than the industry, just like we've seen in prior cycles. Well, we were in a great spot coming in to this quarter from a labor standpoint, from an equipment standpoint and definitely from a service center standpoint, and we've intentionally been heavy. We've tried to protect as many driver positions in particular that we could as we've gone through this slow period. We certainly have seen some attrition within our workforce over the past year. But we've tried to keep as many people on board as we could, knowing that the inflection would individually happened. We believe that it was going to happen earlier in the year. And obviously, we're disappointed when it didn't, but we just continue to try to manage through. And here we are. It did happen in the manner that we thought that it would, but we were well positioned to respond and our existing workforce has been able to do so. Now from here, we have restarted the hiring process in some locations. And we'll continue to run our internal truck driving schools to produce new drivers and have them available as the demand levels dictate. If our shipment volumes continue to increase, if we can see sequential improvement through next year. We want to make sure that we've got all elements of capacity in place to be able to deal with it and not be playing from behind, if you will, and having to try to catch it or not being able to say yes to a customer if they're coming to us and asking if we can handle incremental volumes for them. So it's always a challenge to try to walk that tightrope in terms of managing the elements of capacity. But I think that we did a great job with getting through it this year and we may have carried a little extra cost in doing so. But I think our operating ratio has performed about where we thought it would, given the decrease in volumes. We said earlier in the year that our focus would be to managing our direct cost even in a low volume environment. We've been able to do so without any sacrifice whatsoever to our service quality. In fact, some of our service metrics have actually improved as we've gone through this year. So we're pleased with where our service quality is, the performance of our team, the improving efficiencies that we're seeing. We'll continue to add to the team and continue to rebalance our fleet as well. As we go through 2024, we've still got some deferred replacements that \u2013 where we want to improve the average age of our fleet. But all of that will continue to be worked out as we go through the next year or so. And we want to get back to a growth environment, improving operating ratio environment, all those things we're kind of used to seeing, we just need a little cooperation from the economy to help us along the way. Well, I think that we had \u2013 for one thing, we had a pretty hefty CapEx year this year. And when you look at our operating ratio and the change that we have in the third quarter, that was a bit of a headwind, 110 basis points headwind on the depreciation side and some of the CapEx was basically related to what's happened over the last couple of years with the OEM challenges that we've had, shortages of parts that have required us to carry maybe a little bit more equipment on the books than we would sort of look at from an \u2013 if we were optimizing the fleet standpoint. So I think as we go through next year, if it looks like it's going to be another flattish year, we're already sort of a leg up, if you will. A lot of times, you can take September volumes for the month and kind of just use that to correlate to what the next year's volumes will be. And so we might be looking at even if it's underlying demand doesn't change at all. We believe that we've got the opportunity to win some of the share that we continue to believe will be turning around over the next six months to a year given some of the service issues that I referenced earlier, we're hearing about every day. But we're already in a position where we might see a little bit of volume growth. And then get some yield on top of that, that in an environment where cost may be improving as well. Then yes, that's the environment where in the past, we've been able to produce some operating ratio improvement. I think so. I mean, we're certainly \u2013 we saw the step-up basically in August. And then I was pleased with the performance that we had in September. And when we talked about post the mid-quarter update, where we were from a shipments per day standpoint, we had been at 47,000 shipments per day since December of last year. And basically, that average carried forward through July. We saw that step up. We've talked about kind of an incremental 3,000 shipments per day, and that's where we were in August. In September, normally, it's a 2.5% to 3% increase in shipments per day would be normal seasonality. Although the last month of the first quarter and the second quarter we saw a little bit of a pickup, but nothing close to where normal seasonality would be. That's kind of where we've been missing some of the growth over the last year, but our shipments per day were up 2.1%. So that performed a lot better than what we've been seeing at least in the last month of the quarter, and that really was no new impact. That's just some share shift and then existing customers that are giving us more freight, if you will. So there's been a lot obviously going on over the last four months within the industry, some things obviously permanent. And then like we mentioned, I believe that we'll see some of the volume gain that we had in October that will return to a competitor. So trying to kind of figure out where the daily shipment count gets to in November and December is a little difficult. But if things kind of shake out, if we had just normalized, if you will, and we're more along normal seasonal patterns, we would have been in an environment where \u2013 or if we get back to that from November, December, rather, to where our shipment counts are more flattish, with where we were last year in the fourth quarter and revenue is probably becoming more flattish as well versus being down 5.5% in the third quarter. It may still be down slightly, but it's getting \u2013 everything is kind of getting back to flattish. And I think that, that's a good position to build on as we go into 2024. Hopefully, we'll continue to see some more of those share gains, like I mentioned, just service related. And then if we can get a little bit of help from the economy, then that would build on even more volumes and then we'll just continue to execute, like I said earlier, on the volume side and managing costs. And if we can have that positive delta there, then that's a good setup even if underlying demand is not significantly changing. If it does, and we're not going to precall it like we did last year. But if it does, then that's the type of environment where I think our model shines the brightest when competitors are at capacity issues, and we believe that's happening just based on customer feedback today, then that's when we can really put on the incremental volumes that we build our network up to be prepared for. And so that possibility is out there, but a lot depends on what we may see from an overall economic standpoint. Yes. Our weight per shipment has trended down and really it went down, I guess, in August to about 1,485 pounds, and that was some of that incremental freight that we saw that pickup of about 3,000 shipments per day. Increased a little bit in September, which you'd expect, and we're kind of hanging around that 1,485 pound range here in October as well. So that's something where I believe we're kind of at a baseline, reflecting kind of the underlying freight that's in our book right now. And that will be a metric to watch to see are there increased orders for widgets, does that 1,485 pounds \u2013 do we see that grow to 1,500 to 1,520 pounds getting back closer to the 1,600 pound range that we've seen in robust economies. So it's \u2013 like anything, the freight that you take on as long as you understand the handling characteristics and what the pricing ought to be, that decrease in weight per shipment did have a little bit of a favorable impact on our yield metrics during the quarter. But that's what we have built our business on is investing heavily in all the tools and technologies to understand the freight that we're moving to make sure that we're moving everything profitably with the right pricing in place. And I think that we've made those adjustments to the incremental freight that we've seen thus far. Yes. We \u2013 from a tonnage standpoint, the sequential increase in September from August was up 2.7%, the 10-year average change is a 3.6% increase. So \u2013 but that compares favorably to what our performance has been in the third month of the first few quarters of the year, was the point that I was making. We've seen a little bit stronger pickup in September coming to us versus what we had seen earlier in the year and really no new events, if you will, within the industry that were driving any of that change, just a continuation of some of that freight that had to move at the end of July, we had made the point on the last call that obviously, shippers had to find an immediate home for that freight, and they likely leverage the existing carriers that they had in their networks or at least the large national accounts did. But we believe in and continue to believe that there's going to be some share shifting around. But I think that especially as we go through the fourth quarter, the first quarter of next year, two periods that are seasonally slower during the year is probably the type of environment that shippers will be looking at their overall supply chain partners and figuring out what's the right solution to have. And so I think that we'll see some churn that will be happening over the next six months. I think that there are probably some customers that were at competitors previously that are taking on margin increases right now at a time when their service is probably deteriorating, that it will also be looking at the value that OD can provide. And those are the types of accounts that we've seen in prior periods. It's obviously, the situation is different, but I think it could be very similar to 2021. That environment was just all demand-driven, but demand was incredibly strong. There is tremendous opportunity there from a volume standpoint. And a lot of the competitors simply couldn't take on the incremental volumes because they didn't have all the elements of capacity in place to be able to do so. And they're missing pickups, They're not able to get the freight that they do pick up, delivered on time. And those are the types of customers that increasingly call on Old Dominion. And we're starting to have some of those same types of conversations, maybe not at the same level at this point, but we're having those same conversations today. And we think that, that will create some incremental volume opportunity for us as we progress through the next few quarters. Yes. I think over the next few weeks, bids will be due. And so I think a lot will be determined, obviously, in the next month or so and figuring out who may end up with some of those service centers. I still believe that some of that capacity will be leaving the industry overall. But the reality is all of those shipments that were in place before, it's been several months now. They found a new home. And so if you're \u2013 someone on the strategic side that might be investing, you've got to look and think about how that would make sense, how much incremental capacity do you want to buy that you would have to go out and how would you use it kind of thing. And so those are some of the thoughts that in considerations that I'm sure that we have and that others have as well. But again, from our standpoint, we believe we continue to grow. We will continue to invest in one shape or form, whether it's trying to go back after some of these properties in that bid or if it's something totally independent, which was the path that we were on before they closed their doors. Either way, I think when we think about the long-term, and that's the lens that we try to view our business through, we believe we will be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years because of the quality of service that we offer and the value offering that we have in place. That's going to require investment. Just because you invest doesn't mean you're going to go win share. And if someone does, then it's probably increasing their cost basis. And that could be a good thing for us as well if our competitors' costs are increasing, requiring them to increase rates, even further and maybe closing some of that price gap that exists between us and others. So I think that we tried to say on the last quarter call that our approach is going to be more slow and steady, if you will in this environment where underlying demand is \u2013 continues to remain relatively consistent. We've not seen any type of true inflection in the economy at this point and we're prepared for it when it happens. And I think we've seen some really strong performance in the past when we get into those types of strong demand environment. So we're ready for it from thinking about all elements of capacity. It's more than just service centers. Service centers drive what can be done over the long-term, but you got to have people and equipment as well. And we feel good about where we are with all elements of capacity and our ability to respond to growth when it comes to us, and it will. It's just a matter of time before it comes. And so we'll be ready when that time does come. Yes. We're \u2013 on the service center side, we're at about 25% to 30% excess capacity. We'll necessarily look at those other two pieces of the capacity equation in the same type of way. But our equipment, we're in really good shape with where we are, probably a little bit heavy steel even with the influx of volume that we've seen over the last few months. But like I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to go through and evaluate and optimize that as we look at what our 2024 CapEx plan might be. We've not formulated that at this point, and we'll talk about it on the next earnings call. But what the fleet size should look like given whatever our baseline forecast for 2024 might be. And then we always look at kind of a bull case scenario and a bear case scenario as well to make sure that we've got an operating plan that can meet if we were to see really strong growth or the growth, not necessarily at the levels that our baseline indicated. On the people side, obviously, we've been able to step up and meet the incremental volumes. Our people are getting more work, which I think makes them happy per se. And we had drivers that we're working on the dock and combo type of roles. So we're able to leverage that, putting those employees right back into a truck. And so overall, I think we're in a really great spot with all elements. But it will require, as we get into next year, we do see some incremental growth from where we are now will require investment in our people. And that's why we've restarted some of our truck driving schools, and we are hiring in certain locations as well for new drivers, employees on the platform that are moving the freight on their docks as well. So we will continue to add to the workforce, if you will, as we make our best efforts to match the capacity of our workforce with the shipment levels that we sort of see coming at us, but making sure that they're on board ahead of the curve, so they're properly trained especially on the dock that we make sure that we're maximizing our load factor. We're using our claims prevention tools to keep that cargo claims ratio where it is at 0.1%, all those things are important. But you can't just throw a person right into an environment where we're growing double digits kind of thing. They're just not going to be as efficient or as effective as we probably otherwise won't. So we try to invest ahead of the curve, if you will, for that reason, to make sure that we get appropriate training in place before we really see the growth. Yes, I feel like our \u2013 we've got a great sales team in place that national account team and local field sales that have been working hard over the last year in terms of continuing to build relationships, staying in front of our customers, letting them know that we're here when they need us, and our team work hand in hand with our pricing and costing groups as well. And I think that, that coordination and symmetry that we have there, is evident when you look at our long-term success and our financial results. But we \u2013 about one-third of our business does come by way of 3PLs. We've actually seen a little bit of improvement there. In the third quarter, we had a little bit of growth with the accounts that are within that 3PL book of business just ever so slightly, but at least it was in the green when the overall book of business, the overall revenue was down 5.5% for the quarter, so that was good to see. That was an area of weakness, in particular in the first quarter, where a few carriers, we're putting some lower transaction type pricing in place. And I think that market firmed up pretty quickly in the end of July. So some of that business is starting to come back to us and hopefully, that can be a continuing trend as well. But we've got a great mix of our contract business and continue to grow with our small mom-and-pop accounts as well. And the 3PLs, we see opportunity within all of those categories really and our sales team will continue to leverage that and hopefully be ready for a good growth year in 2024. Sure. It's \u2013 when we laid out the goal to have a sub-70 annual operating ratio, we didn't put a timeframe per se on that because we felt like we might go through \u2013 and a macro environment that's a little bit weaker, and we didn't want to be beholden to some artificial timeline and do things that were more short-term focused versus long-term. And I think when you look at this year, in particular, to have a capital expenditure plan of $720 million in an environment where at one point, we were \u2013 our tonnage was down double digits shows the focus that we try to take on looking out in the long-term and being ready for future growth. And that comes at a cost, and we've seen that increase in the operating ratio this year as a result. And again, the depreciation is probably the biggest drag that we have right now, but that's something that when you look at it on the other hand, when volumes come back, that's where we get leverage. And I've been pleased with the cost performance on the direct cost side. In the third quarter, our direct costs were 51% to 51.5% of overall revenue while our overhead came in at about 19.5% of revenue, and that compares to last year, our overhead was 16.5% to 17%, so deterioration there. But once we get back to the volume environment, we should be able to leverage that completely and get right back to improving our operating ratio, so we're already closed. We've done a couple of quarters with the second and third quarters of last year with 69 something operating ratio. And typically, when we look back through prior years, when we've gone through an environment where volumes have been down, revenue was down, we've lost a little bit on the operating ratio because of that leverage opportunity, we've been able to recover any OR loss in the subsequent year when we've had revenue recovery. And I think that's certainly what we're focused on and believe can happen. So we'll see where that gets us by the time we get to the end of 2024, but we will continue to perform on the direct cost side and continue to look for areas of opportunity as we can drive efficiency within our operations. But trying to get some leverage there on the overhead side, potentially not having to invest as much in 2024, and if we can get some revenue growth going along with that, could potentially produce a beautiful thing when you start looking at that OR."

Thank you for your cooperation.  At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Marty Freeman. Please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Freeman: Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial results for the second quarter, considering the operating challenges associated with the continued softness in the domestic economy and a decrease in our volumes.  With a 15.2% decrease in revenue during the quarter, our team was focused on improving our yield, managing our variable costs and controlling our discretionary spending. As a result, we were pleased to produce a 72.3% operating ratio and earnings per diluted share of $2.65.  We achieved these results by continuing to execute our long-term strategic plans which has guided us for many years throughout many economic cycles. The plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price, which included on-time service performance of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during that second quarter.  Providing this level of superior service strengthens both our value proposition and our relationships with our customers. Delivering superior service also supports our ongoing yield management initiatives. We have improved the quality of our revenue over long term by offering a consistent approach to pricing, which is designed to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in service center capacity and technology.  We believe that our ability to consistently offer network capacity differentiates us from the others in our industry, which is an additional element of our value proposition that we believe will support our long-term market share initiatives.  Our market share remained relatively consistent during the second quarter despite an environment where overall freight demand was subdued. The year-over-year decrease in our volumes, however, resulted in a loss of operating density. We believe that our long-term improvement in our operating ratio requires consistent increases in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. With our commitment to providing superior service as our first priority for our customers, it becomes a challenge to maintain much, less improve, our productivity during the periods with reduced density.  As evidence of this fact, our linehaul latent load factor decreased 3.1% during the second quarter. We were pleased, however, that our platform shipments per hour increased 6.6% and P&D shipments per hour increased 0.5%. These improvements as well as other efforts by our team to manage cost helped us maintain our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue.  Our overhead costs, on the other hand, increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter, as most of these cost categories are fixed. We also believe an increase in aggregate depreciation expense due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure plan.  We believe it is critically important to continue to execute on this plan regardless of the short-term economic outlook. We currently have approximately 30% excess capacity within our service center network, which is a little higher than our target range of 25%. We are comfortable with the amount of excess capacity as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long term. Finding land and building service centers in the right locations can take considerable time. Therefore, we make every effort to stay ahead of our growth curve with these investments.  We could not have doubled our market share over the past 10 years without our consistent investment in service center capacity as well as our regular investments in our fleet, our technology and training, education and benefits for our OD family of employees.  Our proactive approach to managing all elements of capacity has created a strategic advantage for us in the marketplace, which typically becomes most apparent to shippers in tight capacity environments. We do not always know when an inflection point in the demand environment is going to occur, but we believe we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes when it happens.  Through the disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan, our team has created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry. We remain committed to providing superior service at a fair price and maintaining the necessary capacity to support growth, and we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 14.1% decrease in LTL tons per day and 1.1% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our yield metrics were affected by the significant decrease in the price of diesel fuel during the quarter as LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 7.6% reflecting our consistent approach to managing yield.  On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter decreased 2.0% when compared to the first quarter 2023, with LTL tons per day decreasing 1.8% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%.  For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.8% in revenue per day, an increase of 6.8% in tons per day and an increase of 7.2% in shipments per day.  Our shipments per day on average have been relatively consistent since December of last year. We had previously communicated our expectation for volumes to remain consistent through the second quarter despite the sequential growth that we have historically achieved in this period. Our baseline thinking was for volumes to remain consistent through the third quarter as well, although we have noticed an incremental increase in revenue over the past few workdays.  The change in our revenue on a week-by-week basis so far in July has been relatively consistent with historical averages. As a result, it appears that sequential change in both revenue and shipments per day for July will be the first time this year where we're more closely aligned with our 10-year average sequential change.  While there are still a few work days remaining in July, our revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% to 16% when compared to July 2022, although the timing of the July 4 holiday has skewed this number slightly. If the trend that we've seen over the past few workdays hold steady through the end of the month, we expect  [Technical Difficulty] price of diesel fuel and our purchase transportation cost improved 60 basis points. These changes more than offset the increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue for our drivers, platform employees and fleet technicians that are included in our direct costs.  Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $287.8 million and $703.2 million for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while capital expenditures were $244.7 million and $479.4 million for those same periods. We utilized $160.5 million and $302.2 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.8 million and $87.8 million for the same period.  We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our outstanding stock. This program will begin after the completion of our existing $2 billion repurchase program that was announced in July 2021. While we intend to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders, our first priority for capital spending will continue to be the strategic investments in capital expenditures that support the long-term profitable growth of our business.  Our effective tax rate was 25.4% and 26.0% for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the third quarter of 2023.  This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Obviously, there's a lot of noise in the background now with one of the major competitors out there. Can you maybe touch a little bit on what, if anything, you're seeing or expecting either from a diversion -- I guess from a diversion perspective now?\nAdam Satterfield: Sure. Yes, we don't want to make any comments specifically on 1 carrier or another. But like I mentioned, we have seen an uptick in business over the past few days, in particular. But really, I think that over the past few weeks, we have started to start seeing a little bit better trend, if you will, and it goes back to maybe beyond that. I think we're at the end of a long, slow cycle.  And we've stayed in front of our customers over the last 1 year, 1.5 years as things have been slower, I guess really going back to April of last year. And typically, when we get to the end of this kind of cycle, we start hearing comments about service issues with other carriers and the need for shippers to start reusing Old Dominion within their supply chain.  And so we've started increasingly having those types of conversations and certainly, some of that has intensified here over the last few weeks. But when we look at things, we look at our success measured over the period of years over the long term is the way that we continue to try to manage our business and we doubled our market share over the last 10 years and I think when we think about the next 10 years of opportunity, we've got a long runway for growth ahead and we want to keep winning market share in the right way for us.  So we'll continue to stay in front of customers for sure and talk about the Old Dominion value proposition and how we can deliver value to their supply chain. So it has driven a little incremental increase. We had been running at about 47,000 shipments a day. We talked a lot about that on last earnings call last quarter. And we typically see a little bit of an increase in waste from beginning of the month to the end of the month. But we've been, the last few days, running closer to 50,000 shipments a day.  It's hard to say one factor versus another what's driving that higher, but it has been a little bit higher than what I had initially forecast probably a month ago. So maybe it's picked up at this point a 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 shipments per day, more so than what we had initially been forecasting for. But I would expect that we feel like we're getting towards the end of the slow cycle and would expect to start seeing business levels start to return to us at the end of the year and certainly as we get into the early part of 2024, it feels like underlying demand -- takes supply in the industry out of the equation, but it feels like demand is starting to improve a little bit and we're having good conversations with customers just like we've been having all year long. But yes, certainly, it feels like things are starting to turn a little bit.\nJordan Alliger: If I could just ask a follow-up? I think you had mentioned you have about 30% excess capacity in your network now, whether it be demand or competitor problems. I think you also said normally, you like about 25%, but would you push that excess capacity lower? I mean would you be at -- would you run with just 20% or 15% excess capacity or is it a relatively firm line?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Certainly, that 25% is just a target. And we go through periods where, when you look at the system, on average, it's been below that. 2021 is a good example where we had significant sequential growth that year due to the strength of the economy. And we look and you look back at our trend, we were 1 or 2 carriers that had a double-digit sequential increase, at least public carriers from the first to the second quarter 2021 and then we were the only carrier that followed that up with another increase -- sequential increase from the second to the third quarter.  So we've proven in the past that if you've got the right strategies that we can take on business and pretty significant increases in business because of the way that we try to plan for the long term and build capacity into the system. And certainly, you've always got to be thinking -- in our case, we try to think several years ahead and stay ahead of our growth curve. But that -- the service center capacity is one element of the overall capacity equation. There's still the people component of it and the equipment piece as well. But we try to stay further ahead of the curve with service centers.  In certain markets, we try to stay even further ahead, if you will. But that's always a number that flexes up and down and each service center is different. We've got some service centers that got more capacity than others and -- but that's generally about where we try to stay just from an overall system average.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nJames Monigan: James Monigan on for Allison. Just wanted to ask about sort of how we should think about OR in the third quarter? Like you're getting some volume, better pricing trends, presumably as well, how should we think about sort of the potential improvement? And should we essentially see sort of something maybe even above seasonality given the latent operating leverage?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think the top line is going to be the determining factor here. And when it comes to the top line, obviously, we've shared a little bit about where we are with July, and we'll continue to give our mid-quarter update. So August will be out there as well.  But from a baseline standpoint, what I usually was thinking and I may try to address this in a slightly different manner than what we have in the past. Typically, we see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter.  And I would expect this third quarter we are going to have some increase in some of our -- from an aggregate dollar standpoint in some of the overhead categories. I feel like our total overhead expenses are going to -- the dollars wise are going to be higher than where we were. Some of that will be depreciation. We expect our miscellanies expenses to be a bit higher in our general supplies and expenses as well.  So it will depend on where that top line comes in. I think that we can manage -- continue to manage our direct operating costs, which are more variable in nature consistent as a percent of revenue. And so we would look to try to keep those costs consistent with where we were last year. And that would be a slight improvement, but fairly constant with where we were in the second quarter.  And then it just becomes the leverage that we get on the overhead. So if we've got some dollars higher, if the top line, if the volume environment were to stay flatter like what our base case scenario previously was, then obviously, we would lose a little bit more leverage there. But if we get some incremental improvement and further growth from where we are now, I think that's going to be really the slide, if you will, in terms of where the OR might end up that baseline thinking because of the increase in overhead expenses, I was thinking that we would be slightly worse than the normal seasonality, somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points of an increase over what we just did in the second quarter.  So a lot is just going to depend on how those overhead costs as a percent of revenue move around really dependent on what the top line is doing.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: Okay. Great. I guess I'd like to ask a question on the pricing environment. And I guess, more specifically, if you go back 3 months ago, there was -- it seemed like there was incremental competition around some of the transactional freight in the marketplace. Have you seen anything change there, whether it's over the course of the last few months or in recent weeks that would give you some more confidence about the trajectory of pricing in the marketplace? Just any sort of commentary on that, I think, would be helpful.\nKevin Freeman: Yes. There has been no major changes in the pricing environment. I mean we're still getting increases from our contract carriers and there's not anything really crazy going on out there, so -- which is a pleasant surprise in a slower environment. But Again, we're not seeing any changes from the first quarter, and we're still getting increases when we need them.\nJack Atkins: But I guess just a quick follow-up on that, Marty, if I could. I mean are you seeing maybe just given all the shifting dynamics in the marketplace, maybe a little bit less of a competitive situation going on with the transactional part of the market? Are you seeing some firming in pricing there, I guess, was what I was trying to get at?\nKevin Freeman: Yes, I haven't really seen any changes at all whatsoever from a transactional basis. But it's just -- I mean if we need it -- as you know, as I've said before on the last call, we're a cost-plus costing model, that's what we base our pricing on and when we go in to discuss pricing, we basically show our customer what our cost is and they understand why we need to increase. We're not having any issues getting it. But no, I'm not seeing any crazy pricing adjustments out there since the first quarter.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Sticking with that transactional theme. Adam, last quarter, you kind of flagged the 3PL business losses as being a bit more outsized. Has that basically run its course where there's not much more 3PL business to lose? And as you talked about this kind of recent uptick in the last few work days, has that been more kind of transactional volume as well, maybe getting some of that 3PL back? Or are you actually seeing core LTL freight pick up substantially over the last week or so?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, it's more of the core. And I would say, looking through our top 50 customers, the 3PL piece of the business really just performed in line with the company average really in the second quarter. We still had better performance with our core contract business, those that have direct contracts with us. But with revenue down 15%, everyone was pretty much down.  A lot of that, obviously, there's a big decrease in fuel surcharge revenue that had an impact on the second quarter with the average price of fuel being down close to 30%. So that was certainly a headwind that we had to contend with. But that's -- we go back to -- we've had consistent conversations with customers really over the last year. And I think we've been pleased with the trends that we've seen. And certainly, we'd rather be talking about growth and see pure growth going on. So it's been tough to kind of go through the last year or so.  But I think that we've had good customer relationships. We've got long-term customer relationships, people that have gone through supply chain challenges realize the value of Old Dominion and are continuing to increase their business with us. And the demand environment overall with the state of the domestic economy and that has certainly had an impact on our customers' businesses as well.  And so in many accounts that we've kept the contracts have been awarded the same types of customers may just not have the same amount of business that they've had before. And that's kind of what I was alluding to earlier, where I feel like we're getting to the end of that kind of process where it feels like we're seeing stabilization and I go back to just underlying demand for LTL transportation, I felt like things were kind of getting to the point where we were seeing stabilization.  We've had stable trends all year. But I felt like we were getting back to the point where we might start to see our market share -- it's been relatively consistent this year. It's been down slightly, but I felt like we were kind of getting to that end to where things are going to start turning back in our favor.  And some of that just goes to some of the conversations we've had about others in the industry. We're hearing more service failures, and that's generally when the business starts coming back to us. So I feel good about kind of those underlying trends and getting through the back half of this year and being ready for 2024.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup.\nChristian Wetherbee: Maybe I wanted to come back to pricing for a minute, maybe kind of big picture, if we think about the potential for capacity event in the industry where we see capacity materially tighten. I think we've looked at these in the past, we've seen meaningful pricing opportunities for the carriers in the space.  I guess conceptually, how do you think about that? If we were to see some degree of capacity event, given the strength in pricing over this last cycle, is there still material upside as you think about that? I know volume ultimately will come back, but I wanted to get a sense of what you think about the potential future pricing opportunities are as capacity potentially gets tighter in the industry?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think for us, it's all about having a consistent process, and we talk about that a lot. We're trying to have, as Marty mentioned earlier, we have a cost-based process. And we talk about our cost inflation with customers and the need to have a price increase that it's 100 to 150 basis points above our cost inflation every year to support the significant investments that we're making in service center capacity and technologies.  And so I think that's generally understood and it kind of makes sense if you sit across the table and had that conversation. Obviously, a lot goes into that for us managing our cost and trying to keep cost inflation in check, and I was pleased that we're starting to see some of the cost per shipment numbers, they're moderating.  If you take fuel out of the equation, just our core price inflation is starting to trend back to closer to what our expectations were for this year. So I feel like our team has done a phenomenal job with managing our cost and keeping that inflation in check as best we can in a low volume environment. I mean to produce a 7 2 3 in the second quarter with a 14% decrease in tonnage is pretty remarkable in my opinion.  But I think that we just got to stay consistent with our approach. And I think other carriers, they start making similar to what was going on in 2021. If other carriers are closing the pricing gap and are trying to use the environment to take even bigger increases, then I think that bodes well for our market share opportunities. We're typically a little bit more expensive than the other carriers on average, and so we'd be pleased to see that gap close, and that would certainly help support our own pricing initiatives as well.  But the key for us is to focus on us and what we're doing -- having that -- those conversations with customers demonstrating the value that we can add relative to the industry and just looking at what our needs would be to keep driving the cash from operations and the strength of our balance sheet even stronger to support further investments to keep growing the company.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Adam, on the 47,000 to 50,000 uplift in shipments, are there any mix changes there? Because if it is coming from some diversion obviously, yellow have significantly lower weight per shipment. And I don't know if there's any mix observations that may bifurcate shipments from tonnage?  And then if we take this kind of new elevated tonnage number for the last couple of days here and we assume kind of it holds, what does August look like from a year-over-year perspective?  And then the last question, 3 parter, but 1 question. Yellow is very different than OD. And obviously, yellow, there's -- I know you don't want to address yellow specifically, but they're the third largest LTL company, and they seem to be on the brink of going out of business.  And so the question is, if Yellow customers are looking to divert, is -- do you think OD is the natural relief out there because you are kind of the most expensive best service company out there? I'm just trying to understand, are you the right barometer for that or maybe you see some of it, but a lot of it goes elsewhere.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I see if I can try to address those in some sense of order, but to answer your first question from a mix standpoint, not a lot has changed with mix. Our weight per shipments dropped a little bit. We've gotten down to about -- we dropped about 10 pounds. We've gotten down to about 1,525 pound average or so, and it's dropped about 10 pounds or so here recently.  But not a lot is changing. I think some of that is, we are -- seems to be picking up some more of the smaller tariff-based customers that generally got a little bit lower weight per shipment. So that's been good to see, if you will, overall. And whether or not that continues remains to be seen.  And obviously, this is all just kind of developing. But I don't want to get into if we hold this trend steady, hold that trend steady, I mean, generally, August sequentially is up about 0.5% for our shipments per day are up about 0.5% over July. And we'd expect that some of this recent trend, it's possible that if things continue to hold steady like they have, I talked about the impact of July for that, but obviously, that could carry forward a little bit stronger, but we'll just take it 1 step at a time and keep giving the updates out there as they are.  But we were -- last year, in August, we were at about an average of 51,000 shipments per day. So it starts closing the gap, if you will, if we can hold 50,000 steady. But keep in mind and that's what I was alluding to earlier that there's a natural progression that happens from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and we were already starting to see some trends.  So I don't know that you can't just take that gap from where we've been averaging 47,000 shipments a day really since December of last year and just say, okay, there's this immediate incremental change.  There's been change that's been developing. And you can't disappoint the one specific player to say, this is the reason why. It's been a developing trend, and it's the way history has played out for us. When we get to the end of the cycle, we start winning business from different carriers.  And so with that said, I think that there may be direct freight opportunities, but indirect trade opportunities as well that may come out of if there is an industry event. And I think that's still an if. And we don't know any more than anybody else. But we just are staying engaged with our customers, making sure that they understand the capacity that we have.  And I think everyone knows the service that we can offer and no different than I think 2021 is an example where freight was obviously coming to us very quickly that year, and we stepped up in a very big way through the second and third quarters. And a lot of the conversations that we had with shippers being will be similar conversations that we have now. We protect our existing customers capacity for them and that's how we would manage through if we get into another period where the freight opportunity is accelerating significantly.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nThomas Wadewitz: I wanted to go back to your comment on the capacity in the network. You referred to the 30% being above what your target is. I guess if you kind of juxtapose that with there may be opportunity for terminals related to the discussion we've been having about the big industry participants that's under pressure.  So I'm wondering, would you consider being opportunistic and say, \"Hey, we've got maybe more capacity than we need in the network, but there is an opportunity to kind of bring in a bunch of additional terminals that maybe fit well?\" Or just how do you think about that and the kind of pace of terminal additions if you look at, I don't know, next 2 years, something like that?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Tom, we're always looking for opportunities. And that's why we try to stay so far ahead of the growth curve. We generally are looking at each service center in each region and projecting out 5 years of potential growth to know where we're going to have facilities that start hitting capacity.  And those are the ones that go on our target list for kind of we roll out internally a 2-year capital expenditure plan to expand service center capacity and where we need it. So sometimes an opportunity presents itself that maybe we don't need this particular location, but in year 4, for example, but if it's a good facility, then we would go ahead and take advantage of it.  And again, it gets back to, we've got our long-term market share initiatives and what we think we can achieve over a longer period of time and so we know we're going to keep growing this network. We've been one of a few carriers that have been expanding. Many talk about it, but when you look over the last 10 years and you look at the capacity additions that we've made, the public carriers in total are actually down in terms of the number of service centers in the industry.  So we're going to continue to say that's a big part of our value proposition is, we're consistently investing dollars to be able to support our customers' growth and make sure that we can be there when our customers need us the most and when they've got growth potential but they need an LTL carrier to be able to respond, and we not just be able to respond in the middle of the month when things aren't as busy, but at the end of the month when they're trying to get the freight moved off the dock and deliver to their customers, that's 1 thing that they can rely on OD.  So we'll certainly continue to look for opportunities, and we would be opportunistic in adding facilities if it makes sense within the long-term vision for our network.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: I guess if we look back on the scale of an industry shift like this, right, where I guess, consolidated freight ways back in '02 or New England motor freight right where you've had big and quick historical rapid change. Maybe talk a little bit about -- you talked about customer discussions accelerating. Are these kind of existing customers, Adam, I think you threw out there the top 50 customers, their business was down also, but are you seeing that mainly from internal, are you having new discussions? I presume not that many, just given, I guess, any user of Yellow is maybe looking for lower cost versus higher quality.  And then maybe secondary is your thought on headcount, right, as you make this shift, I know you've got the 30% excess capacity on the facilities, what's your thoughts on headcount and capacity there as well?\nKevin Freeman: Yes. Yes, we currently talk to new customers every week. We have over 500 salespeople and part of their job is to bring on new business. So they're out there having discussions about onboarding new customers every week, but -- and as well as existing customers and if the customers have questions about capacity, of course, we answer those.  We show them where we have capacity, our terminal network and so forth. So that -- those are just ongoing discussions. But as far as labor, we have the labor covered. We have a driver training school where we have -- we call them combo drivers.  If we're not utilizing them during slow periods, they go on the dock and then we can bring them back onto a truck as our tonnage and shipments increase. So we feel like we're pretty covered on labor. And for any increases, it might come our way. So I feel confident we can take on whatever comes our way.\nKenneth Hoexter: And then just I guess to clarify, Marty, do you -- mind just a follow-up here. I know you said or Adam said it was a slow kind of grind here. But I just want to understand, in the last 48 hours, has this not been a massive shift?  I guess I understand they stopped picking up freight last night. I just want to understand the speed and scale with which we're talking about here.\nKevin Freeman: Yes. We're reading the same thing as you are. So we really don't know what's going on, but we're talking about it within our senior management team every day and how we're going to put forth our plan to handle additional business. But we're not really seeing any major business coming out of that. And just like you, we don't know how that's going to end up. So we don't want to speculate at this time.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nBruce Chan: Adam and Marty, I'm not sure if this got captured in some of the previous answers, but I wanted to ask it maybe a little bit more directly. If you think about the potential share wins from this, I guess, impending competitor exit, would you expect to see outsized share gains given your capacity expansion or maybe slower share gains given a more disciplined yield approach and what you mentioned was a higher average price than the market?\nKevin Freeman: Well, as you know, we're very disciplined on price, and we're not going to do anything to trash our service by taking on too much freight. So we expect if something were to happen that we would remain disciplined in that manner. And like Adam said, we'd look after our existing customers and we cost out every piece of business that comes through this truck line.  And if it doesn't have the yield that we expect, we just won't take it on. But -- and we also expect if there is a major event happens that we'll gain business probably from other carriers that weren't participating in that event because they may take on too much revenue and trash their service and we'll benefit from that as well. So we've experienced that before and ready for it again.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Eric Morgan with Barclays.\nUnidentified Analyst: So I just had a follow-up on the headcount comment. Marty, you mentioned you're confident from a labor perspective that you can handle some of this incremental freight. Are you saying that you think you can handle the surge with limited headcount increases from here or are you just more confident that you'll be able to ramp up your labor force accordingly if you do see volume tick up?  And then I was also just curious on cost per employee. Any thoughts there. I know it's been kind of trending roughly flattish, up a little, down a little over the last few quarters? Just curious how this could affect that metric.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. This is Adam. But -- we've had a decrease in headcount or we do sequentially through the second quarter and we've seen attrition really going back into last year through our business. But I think that -- like I mentioned, there's 3 elements of capacity, and we certainly -- we've got plenty. We talk mostly about our service center piece. But we've got equipment capacity to respond to the acceleration in business levels and from a people standpoint, we can do the same.  We've shown that type of flex in our workforce in the past. I mean we've got people that I think we can call back as well. Marty mentioned, our internal truck driving school, that's created about 1/3 of our drivers and sometimes drivers come out of that school, but continue to work on the platform until demand is such that we put them into a full-time driving job.  So there's multiple opportunities. The other lever that we could pull. And we did this going back to looking at those 2021 sequential trends. But as business accelerated really through the second half of 2020 continuing through 2021 as needed, we don't like to do this, but we can use purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our workforce or our fleet.  And so it just kind of depends on the pace at which volume comes on, but we had those big quarter-after-quarter sequential increases during those periods back in the end and that was kind of the final lever to pull. And -- so we certainly can have that. We would rather move our linehaul 100% of our fleet and with our people. But as necessary, we sometimes have to supplement, and that's kind of the source that we could go to on a very short-term basis. It would always be with the idea that we get it back 100% in-sourced as soon as possible if we had to go that route.\nOperator: Next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Adam, you mentioned a couple of times just like the intra-month seasonality of shipments that obviously, we just don't know. I wouldn't normally ask it like a short-term question, but it's obviously an unusual time.  Maybe if it's possible. Can you just like just share like year-over-year tonnage the last couple of days, like what that's trending? I just -- we just want to get a sense of like run rate very recently. And then -- the -- I think yield is down 3%-or-so in July. Any sense what yield ex-fuel is doing in July?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. And that we had had already talked about in the prepared comments, but it's somewhere 6.5% to 7% the revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel surcharge. Obviously, right now, we're getting -- continuing to see fuel that's down. I think July should be the worst.  At this point, we continue to average where we are fuel will be down about 30% again. But in the third quarter of last year was when fuel prices started declining, and then that continued on. So that will be less of a headwind, as we go through the second half of this year. But we're continuing to get core increases, as Marty mentioned earlier, and the key will be to continue to look at whether it's us or others, is there a sequential increase there.  That's what we strive every day, we've got contracts that are turning over. And we're going through those contracts and able to negotiate increases if mix is relatively constant, you should see sequential increases in those yield metrics. But like I mentioned, the last few days, we've been right at around 50,000 shipments per day. Some of that is just the natural growth that happens towards the end of the month. And whether it accelerates from there kind of remains to be seen. I held that 50,000 numbers that I gave this morning assumed that we kind of held that 50,000 constant for the remaining workdays, today through Friday and Monday of next week.  So if there's numbers that when we put them in our queue that are different from what we talked about today, then you can sort of judge from there where things came in. July of last year, was a little over 51,000 and 52,000 shipments per day and I mentioned, August was 50,000 to 51,000. So we're back to where our shipments per day if this kind of 50 were the hold content, and I'm not saying that it does, to where we're closer from a volume standpoint to where we were last year.  And then just sort of getting back to the -- keep trying to bring us back to the big picture, I think that success ain't going to be defined by what we can do next week and next month or next quarter, it's -- what's the market share potential over the long term, and we still feel confident about what our long-term market share potential can be because we still win business by the quality of our service.  Our value proposition is delivering superior service at a fair price and always maintaining network capacity to support our customers' growth. And I think we continue to win share because of the service and capacity advantages that we have in the marketplace, and that will extend beyond what may be happening over the next few weeks.\nScott Group: So Adam, your point there is that others may get maybe a little bit more of the volume day 1, but to the extent that they struggle with this big surge in volume, you'll then get it on a derivative basis, maybe it's not day 1, but it's weeks or months from now. Is that kind of what you're trying to say?\nAdam Satterfield: Exactly. Slow and steady generally wins the rates, and we want to be patient with the things. And certainly, we're looking and having conversations with customers and want to help where we can. But just like in 2021, you got to be careful about opportunity.  You don't want to take on so much so fast that you end up not being able to deliver on the service value that we offer with 99% on time and on a claims ratio of 0.1%. So we want to be methodical about the way we go through this and make sure that we're protecting servicing capacity for our existing shippers without taking on too much of what opportunity may be out there.  And so I think when you go back and you look in prior trends, like I said, we stepped up in the second quarter more so than anyone else. When you look at 2021, when you look at that sequential acceleration, and then we continue to follow on from there where others didn't. So it's always just making sure that you don't over-extend yourself in the short term and just keep that eye on the ball for the long-term vision.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Sorry to say this topic, but I just wanted to kind of basically clean up the commentary on this call, which is the uptick in volume that you see in the last few days, how much of that is because of a cyclical improvement versus flow-through from what's going on at your competitor? Like is it 1 of the 2 of them? Is it both? And kind of can you tell the 2 of those apart?\nAdam Satterfield: It's really hard to try to bifurcate and put your finger on what's driving any type of acceleration there. As I've mentioned, we would expect to see an increase. We're going into the final full week of the month. We would expect to see a normal type of increase. And it's a little bit above where I'd originally forecast this week to be at least, but when I go back to Friday was a bit heavier and then Monday and Tuesday have been a little bit heavier than what I had originally looked at.  And so is that just because we've got more business from an existing customer that's having their own end of month surge? Yes, that's part of it. Is it freight that's coming in, we're -- there's been some freight diversion? Yes, that's a part of it.  So you just can't put your finger on everything when we're doing 50,000 shipments a day, why did we get this 1 particular shipment? But that's why I wanted to point out that really, I think this goes back to, for several weeks, I feel like we've seen some pretty nice trends. We closed out the month of June strong.  I feel like when we go back, even though our number of shipments per day have been around 47,000, we've had some good end-of-month performance. And the trends, the intra-month trends have been pretty good the last couple of months as well. We dropped off some early in the month, which that's typical too, but maybe dropping off a little bit more so than what a week-by-week average would be.  But then we've made up for it as we've progressed through the month. So I've been pleased with our performance so far in July and it looks like at least right now when we project out and carry that trend forward of shipments per day that we're still down in comparison to June. Some of that is July is a 20-workday month and the way the July 4 holiday fell that Monday that we were open was probably half of a normal workday. So if you kind of adjust for that, we had seen better trends.  We have been more in the 48,000-or-so shipments per day range kind of through the month before this recent pickup happened. So it's just not -- I can't put your finger on what completely is driving the change other than you go back and this is somewhat typical to what we would see at the end of a slow period like we've been in since April of last year and then it's just been accelerated over the last few work days from there.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Super quick follow-up. Did you take any short-term cost savings actions in this quarter that may potentially unwind if tonnage really comes back?\nAdam Satterfield: We keep our belts tight every day. So we're always looking at managing our variable cost and controlling discretionary spending where we can and where it makes sense. But that's a philosophy that you can't just sort of take it or leave it. It's a mindset that you have to stay in, in good times and in bad. If you don't have that mindset in the good times, you're not going to be able to switch gears when you really need to.  So I think that we certainly have been able to trim out some cost and I was pleased we ended up with a better operating ratio in the second quarter than what we had initially talked about. So that was good to see. And I think that I mentioned earlier, we're going to have some of those overhead cost categories.  Overhead costs are about 19.5% to 20% of our revenue in total when he split those out and our direct costs are 2.5% to 53% of revenue. We're going to have some cost increases. We're continuing to have depreciation dollars that will increase from the second to the third quarter.  Our general supplies and expenses should be up in the third quarter over the second. And then I would expect that our miscellaneous expenses would be up as well. So those dollar costs will be there. Whether or not we've got some revenue growth to offset them kind of remains to be seen similar to what we were talking about before. So -- but some of those dollars will be increasing from the second to the third.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to focus again on what's going on with Yellow and look out at pricing. I don't think I heard this, but generally, I wouldn't have expected anybody to try to push the GRI through, excluding what's been happening. But do you think there is a likelihood that this occurs now if there is a bankruptcy in the near future?\nKevin Freeman: As I said before, I don't want to speculate what's going to happen but I will say that we took our GRI in January, and we don't foresee having to take another one this year as it relates to transactional business. I mean we're going to manage the same way we would with them or without them.  So I can't speak for the other carriers, but I would say -- maybe some of them do need to firm up their prices with it, and maybe they'll use that as an opportunity. Who knows. But we've got a good handle on our cost, and we had that before YRC and we'll have it after. So I don't see us considering a GRI on transactional business.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Marty, that makes sense. So you're not expecting it, but you wouldn't be surprised if maybe others tried because you're not exactly at your level. I wanted to, Adam, jump on something you mentioned with sort of slow and steady wins the race and freight coming back with people not being able to handle it. But even if people handle it, won't there be cases of freight not being what people think and it's just needing to find proper homes within a given network?\nAdam Satterfield: Typically, that plays out exactly as you described. where it may find a temporary home, but then ultimately, and in some cases, people have just got to get their freight moved and they may go to the next closest carrier from a price standpoint. And just to keep their supply chain moving. But ultimately, if they want value in their supply chain, that freight will find a home at Old Dominion.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the performance you've seen if there's been any differentiating trends between maybe your more retail consumer customers and then those that are more maybe industrial-focused?  And then same thing, if you're hearing from your customers, kind of their expectations as you go into the back half of this year, thoughts on inventory levels where they stand today? Just any kind of bigger picture color would be helpful.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We saw generally consistent performance in the second quarter with the industrial and our retail-related customers. Industrial is 55% to 60% of our business overall. And historically, we look at ISM and industrial production, which I assume has been below 50 or at or below 50, I think, for 9 months now and that generally reconciles with the industry volumes.  And certainly aligns with the second quarter when we were down 14%. But overall, we think that some of the conversations that we've had that we get the sense that inventory levels are normalizing a bit. That's kind of supported my baseline thinking of getting back to some consistency with volumes going into the second half of this year. And that would be back in alignment with what our normal sequential trends are with volumes anyways.  Typically, in the third quarter, our shipments are up about 1.5% to 2% over the second quarter. And then we generally have about a 3.5% decrease in the fourth quarter. So we've been -- there's been a pretty wide gap between our sequential -- actual sequential trends relative to the 10-year average for the past few quarters. So I felt like we were -- in a normalized environment, we're going to get back to closer to those 10-year average trends and then hopefully then get back to seeing real growth once we got into 2024.  But -- so it seems like some of the tea leaves and some of the conversations that we've had with customers would suggest this normalization and then freight actually picking up and moving again, which was the positive that we were looking at and thinking about and planning for in terms of the second half of this year in 2024.  And then obviously, we've had some recent developments that have accelerated things a little further here over the last week-or-so.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Yes. As you look back over the last couple of months and -- but inclusive of the last few days, can you talk a little bit about the drivers of getting back to that normal sequential trend? And by that, I mean specifically, the like-for-like shipments from existing customers versus new customer acquisition versus anything else that you'd like to kind of size up directionally in magnitude as you think about filling that excess capacity over the next several quarters?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Like I said earlier, and we've talked about this on recent calls. From a core contract customer standpoint, we've actually had good trends. And when we look at having a double-digit decrease in volumes that may seem counterintuitive. But certainly, the economy has weighed on many customers and has impacted their trends.  But when we look at our our national account business and the wins that we've had versus losses, we continue to have the good wins and have not really lost any share to speak of with those larger national accounts, but they've just had reduced volumes.  We have lost and have talked about our business levels with third-party logistics companies has been down in recent quarters and that was still negative in the second quarter as well. But that's something where I think that certainly shippers have been looking to save cost and they've been using the 3PLs to find carriers that had a little cheaper price than us maybe and divert some freight away for that reason.  But I think now, just like we've seen in prior cycles, servicing capacity are coming squarely back into focus for many shippers. And so I think that lends itself to how we've won market share over the long term. So there's not necessarily any one piece of business that's changing any more than others. We've got a lot of consistency within our largest accounts, and these are long-term strong relationships that we have between us and our customers.  And so our sales team, our pricing team, they're staying in front of our customers and staying engaged and making sure that they know we're here when they need us. And we're increasingly getting those inbound phone calls and being able to take on some incremental business.  So it's good to see, but we still would like to see the overall macro environment improving, would love to see the ISM going back above 50 and really talking about more of a true improvement in the underlying demand environment versus what the supply situation in the industry might be.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Christopher Kuhn with Benchmark.\nChristopher Kuhn: I just wondering, the West Coast ports had a bit of a pickup in June. Just wondering, I know some of it is indirect if that benefited some of the volumes that you saw and then maybe if it picks up as the year progresses, would that help the\nKevin Freeman: Yes. This is Marty. I read the other day that in June, imports from China to the U.S. fell 24%. Taiwan, it fell 23%, Vietnam 11% and South Korea 6%. So we haven't seen a lot of energy coming from those ports. As you know, we have a division on the East Coast ports and those business levels are down there. So I think the whole global economy is still rather yield, but we're prepared to handle that, too, if it picks up, but we're not seeing any of that movement so far this year in an upward manner.\nOperator: And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor to Marty Freeman for any closing comments.\nKevin Freeman: Yes. I want to thank you all today for your participation, and we appreciate all the questions. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to call us after the call. And I hope you guys have a great day and a good rest of your summer.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Kevin Freeman",
            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. The OD team delivered solid financial results for the second quarter, considering the operating challenges associated with the continued softness in the domestic economy and a decrease in our volumes.  With a 15.2% decrease in revenue during the quarter, our team was focused on improving our yield, managing our variable costs and controlling our discretionary spending. As a result, we were pleased to produce a 72.3% operating ratio and earnings per diluted share of $2.65.  We achieved these results by continuing to execute our long-term strategic plans which has guided us for many years throughout many economic cycles. The plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price, which included on-time service performance of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1% during that second quarter.  Providing this level of superior service strengthens both our value proposition and our relationships with our customers. Delivering superior service also supports our ongoing yield management initiatives. We have improved the quality of our revenue over long term by offering a consistent approach to pricing, which is designed to offset our cost inflation and support our ongoing investments in service center capacity and technology.  We believe that our ability to consistently offer network capacity differentiates us from the others in our industry, which is an additional element of our value proposition that we believe will support our long-term market share initiatives.  Our market share remained relatively consistent during the second quarter despite an environment where overall freight demand was subdued. The year-over-year decrease in our volumes, however, resulted in a loss of operating density. We believe that our long-term improvement in our operating ratio requires consistent increases in both density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. With our commitment to providing superior service as our first priority for our customers, it becomes a challenge to maintain much, less improve, our productivity during the periods with reduced density.  As evidence of this fact, our linehaul latent load factor decreased 3.1% during the second quarter. We were pleased, however, that our platform shipments per hour increased 6.6% and P&D shipments per hour increased 0.5%. These improvements as well as other efforts by our team to manage cost helped us maintain our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue.  Our overhead costs, on the other hand, increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter, as most of these cost categories are fixed. We also believe an increase in aggregate depreciation expense due to the ongoing execution of our capital expenditure plan.  We believe it is critically important to continue to execute on this plan regardless of the short-term economic outlook. We currently have approximately 30% excess capacity within our service center network, which is a little higher than our target range of 25%. We are comfortable with the amount of excess capacity as we remain confident in our ability to win market share over the long term. Finding land and building service centers in the right locations can take considerable time. Therefore, we make every effort to stay ahead of our growth curve with these investments.  We could not have doubled our market share over the past 10 years without our consistent investment in service center capacity as well as our regular investments in our fleet, our technology and training, education and benefits for our OD family of employees.  Our proactive approach to managing all elements of capacity has created a strategic advantage for us in the marketplace, which typically becomes most apparent to shippers in tight capacity environments. We do not always know when an inflection point in the demand environment is going to occur, but we believe we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes when it happens.  Through the disciplined execution of our long-term strategic plan, our team has created one of the strongest records for long-term growth and profitability in the LTL industry. We remain committed to providing superior service at a fair price and maintaining the necessary capacity to support growth, and we believe we are better positioned than any other carrier to produce long-term profitable growth while increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning, and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Yes. There has been no major changes in the pricing environment. I mean we're still getting increases from our contract carriers and there's not anything really crazy going on out there, so -- which is a pleasant surprise in a slower environment. But Again, we're not seeing any changes from the first quarter, and we're still getting increases when we need them. Yes, I haven't really seen any changes at all whatsoever from a transactional basis. But it's just -- I mean if we need it -- as you know, as I've said before on the last call, we're a cost-plus costing model, that's what we base our pricing on and when we go in to discuss pricing, we basically show our customer what our cost is and they understand why we need to increase. We're not having any issues getting it. But no, I'm not seeing any crazy pricing adjustments out there since the first quarter. Yes. Yes, we currently talk to new customers every week. We have over 500 salespeople and part of their job is to bring on new business. So they're out there having discussions about onboarding new customers every week, but -- and as well as existing customers and if the customers have questions about capacity, of course, we answer those.  We show them where we have capacity, our terminal network and so forth. So that -- those are just ongoing discussions. But as far as labor, we have the labor covered. We have a driver training school where we have -- we call them combo drivers.  If we're not utilizing them during slow periods, they go on the dock and then we can bring them back onto a truck as our tonnage and shipments increase. So we feel like we're pretty covered on labor. And for any increases, it might come our way. So I feel confident we can take on whatever comes our way. Yes. We're reading the same thing as you are. So we really don't know what's going on, but we're talking about it within our senior management team every day and how we're going to put forth our plan to handle additional business. But we're not really seeing any major business coming out of that. And just like you, we don't know how that's going to end up. So we don't want to speculate at this time. Well, as you know, we're very disciplined on price, and we're not going to do anything to trash our service by taking on too much freight. So we expect if something were to happen that we would remain disciplined in that manner. And like Adam said, we'd look after our existing customers and we cost out every piece of business that comes through this truck line.  And if it doesn't have the yield that we expect, we just won't take it on. But -- and we also expect if there is a major event happens that we'll gain business probably from other carriers that weren't participating in that event because they may take on too much revenue and trash their service and we'll benefit from that as well. So we've experienced that before and ready for it again. As I said before, I don't want to speculate what's going to happen but I will say that we took our GRI in January, and we don't foresee having to take another one this year as it relates to transactional business. I mean we're going to manage the same way we would with them or without them.  So I can't speak for the other carriers, but I would say -- maybe some of them do need to firm up their prices with it, and maybe they'll use that as an opportunity. Who knows. But we've got a good handle on our cost, and we had that before YRC and we'll have it after. So I don't see us considering a GRI on transactional business. Yes. This is Marty. I read the other day that in June, imports from China to the U.S. fell 24%. Taiwan, it fell 23%, Vietnam 11% and South Korea 6%. So we haven't seen a lot of energy coming from those ports.

So I think the whole global economy is still rather yield, but we're prepared to handle that, too, if it picks up, but we're not seeing any of that movement so far this year in an upward manner. Yes.

            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue results for the second quarter reflect a 14.1% decrease in LTL tons per day and 1.1% decrease in LTL revenue per hundredweight. Our yield metrics were affected by the significant decrease in the price of diesel fuel during the quarter as LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 7.6% reflecting our consistent approach to managing yield.  On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the second quarter decreased 2.0% when compared to the first quarter 2023, with LTL tons per day decreasing 1.8% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 0.3%.  For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 9.8% in revenue per day, an increase of 6.8% in tons per day and an increase of 7.2% in shipments per day.  Our shipments per day on average have been relatively consistent since December of last year. We had previously communicated our expectation for volumes to remain consistent through the second quarter despite the sequential growth that we have historically achieved in this period. Our baseline thinking was for volumes to remain consistent through the third quarter as well, although we have noticed an incremental increase in revenue over the past few workdays.  The change in our revenue on a week-by-week basis so far in July has been relatively consistent with historical averages. As a result, it appears that sequential change in both revenue and shipments per day for July will be the first time this year where we're more closely aligned with our 10-year average sequential change.  While there are still a few work days remaining in July, our revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% to 16% when compared to July 2022, although the timing of the July 4 holiday has skewed this number slightly. If the trend that we've seen over the past few workdays hold steady through the end of the month, we expect  [Technical Difficulty] price of diesel fuel and our purchase transportation cost improved 60 basis points. These changes more than offset the increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue for our drivers, platform employees and fleet technicians that are included in our direct costs.  Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $287.8 million and $703.2 million for the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while capital expenditures were $244.7 million and $479.4 million for those same periods. We utilized $160.5 million and $302.2 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2023, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $43.8 million and $87.8 million for the same period.  We announced this morning that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program that provides us with the authorization to repurchase up to $3 billion of our outstanding stock. This program will begin after the completion of our existing $2 billion repurchase program that was announced in July 2021. While we intend to continue our focus of returning excess capital to our shareholders, our first priority for capital spending will continue to be the strategic investments in capital expenditures that support the long-term profitable growth of our business.  Our effective tax rate was 25.4% and 26.0% for the second quarter of 2023 and 2022, respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the third quarter of 2023.  This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Sure. Yes, we don't want to make any comments specifically on 1 carrier or another. But like I mentioned, we have seen an uptick in business over the past few days, in particular. But really, I think that over the past few weeks, we have started to start seeing a little bit better trend, if you will, and it goes back to maybe beyond that. I think we're at the end of a long, slow cycle.  And we've stayed in front of our customers over the last 1 year, 1.5 years as things have been slower, I guess really going back to April of last year. And typically, when we get to the end of this kind of cycle, we start hearing comments about service issues with other carriers and the need for shippers to start reusing Old Dominion within their supply chain.  And so we've started increasingly having those types of conversations and certainly, some of that has intensified here over the last few weeks. But when we look at things, we look at our success measured over the period of years over the long term is the way that we continue to try to manage our business and we doubled our market share over the last 10 years and I think when we think about the next 10 years of opportunity, we've got a long runway for growth ahead and we want to keep winning market share in the right way for us.  So we'll continue to stay in front of customers for sure and talk about the Old Dominion value proposition and how we can deliver value to their supply chain. So it has driven a little incremental increase. We had been running at about 47,000 shipments a day. We talked a lot about that on last earnings call last quarter. And we typically see a little bit of an increase in waste from beginning of the month to the end of the month. But we've been, the last few days, running closer to 50,000 shipments a day.  It's hard to say one factor versus another what's driving that higher, but it has been a little bit higher than what I had initially forecast probably a month ago. So maybe it's picked up at this point a 1,000, 1,500, 2,000 shipments per day, more so than what we had initially been forecasting for. But I would expect that we feel like we're getting towards the end of the slow cycle and would expect to start seeing business levels start to return to us at the end of the year and certainly as we get into the early part of 2024, it feels like underlying demand -- takes supply in the industry out of the equation, but it feels like demand is starting to improve a little bit and we're having good conversations with customers just like we've been having all year long. But yes, certainly, it feels like things are starting to turn a little bit. Yes. Certainly, that 25% is just a target. And we go through periods where, when you look at the system, on average, it's been below that. 2021 is a good example where we had significant sequential growth that year due to the strength of the economy. And we look and you look back at our trend, we were 1 or 2 carriers that had a double-digit sequential increase, at least public carriers from the first to the second quarter 2021 and then we were the only carrier that followed that up with another increase -- sequential increase from the second to the third quarter.  So we've proven in the past that if you've got the right strategies that we can take on business and pretty significant increases in business because of the way that we try to plan for the long term and build capacity into the system. And certainly, you've always got to be thinking -- in our case, we try to think several years ahead and stay ahead of our growth curve. But that -- the service center capacity is one element of the overall capacity equation. There's still the people component of it and the equipment piece as well. But we try to stay further ahead of the curve with service centers.  In certain markets, we try to stay even further ahead, if you will. But that's always a number that flexes up and down and each service center is different. We've got some service centers that got more capacity than others and -- but that's generally about where we try to stay just from an overall system average. Well, I think the top line is going to be the determining factor here. And when it comes to the top line, obviously, we've shared a little bit about where we are with July, and we'll continue to give our mid-quarter update. So August will be out there as well.  But from a baseline standpoint, what I usually was thinking and I may try to address this in a slightly different manner than what we have in the past. Typically, we see about a 50 basis point increase in the operating ratio from the second to the third quarter.  And I would expect this third quarter we are going to have some increase in some of our -- from an aggregate dollar standpoint in some of the overhead categories. I feel like our total overhead expenses are going to -- the dollars wise are going to be higher than where we were. Some of that will be depreciation. We expect our miscellanies expenses to be a bit higher in our general supplies and expenses as well.  So it will depend on where that top line comes in. I think that we can manage -- continue to manage our direct operating costs, which are more variable in nature consistent as a percent of revenue. And so we would look to try to keep those costs consistent with where we were last year. And that would be a slight improvement, but fairly constant with where we were in the second quarter.  And then it just becomes the leverage that we get on the overhead. So if we've got some dollars higher, if the top line, if the volume environment were to stay flatter like what our base case scenario previously was, then obviously, we would lose a little bit more leverage there. But if we get some incremental improvement and further growth from where we are now, I think that's going to be really the slide, if you will, in terms of where the OR might end up that baseline thinking because of the increase in overhead expenses, I was thinking that we would be slightly worse than the normal seasonality, somewhere between 50 to 100 basis points of an increase over what we just did in the second quarter.  So a lot is just going to depend on how those overhead costs as a percent of revenue move around really dependent on what the top line is doing. Yes, it's more of the core. And I would say, looking through our top 50 customers, the 3PL piece of the business really just performed in line with the company average really in the second quarter. We still had better performance with our core contract business, those that have direct contracts with us. But with revenue down 15%, everyone was pretty much down.  A lot of that, obviously, there's a big decrease in fuel surcharge revenue that had an impact on the second quarter with the average price of fuel being down close to 30%. So that was certainly a headwind that we had to contend with. But that's -- we go back to -- we've had consistent conversations with customers really over the last year. And I think we've been pleased with the trends that we've seen. And certainly, we'd rather be talking about growth and see pure growth going on. So it's been tough to kind of go through the last year or so.  But I think that we've had good customer relationships. We've got long-term customer relationships, people that have gone through supply chain challenges realize the value of Old Dominion and are continuing to increase their business with us. And the demand environment overall with the state of the domestic economy and that has certainly had an impact on our customers' businesses as well.  And so in many accounts that we've kept the contracts have been awarded the same types of customers may just not have the same amount of business that they've had before. And that's kind of what I was alluding to earlier, where I feel like we're getting to the end of that kind of process where it feels like we're seeing stabilization and I go back to just underlying demand for LTL transportation, I felt like things were kind of getting to the point where we were seeing stabilization.  We've had stable trends all year. But I felt like we were getting back to the point where we might start to see our market share -- it's been relatively consistent this year. It's been down slightly, but I felt like we were kind of getting to that end to where things are going to start turning back in our favor.  And some of that just goes to some of the conversations we've had about others in the industry. We're hearing more service failures, and that's generally when the business starts coming back to us. So I feel good about kind of those underlying trends and getting through the back half of this year and being ready for 2024. Well, I think for us, it's all about having a consistent process, and we talk about that a lot. We're trying to have, as Marty mentioned earlier, we have a cost-based process. And we talk about our cost inflation with customers and the need to have a price increase that it's 100 to 150 basis points above our cost inflation every year to support the significant investments that we're making in service center capacity and technologies.  And so I think that's generally understood and it kind of makes sense if you sit across the table and had that conversation. Obviously, a lot goes into that for us managing our cost and trying to keep cost inflation in check, and I was pleased that we're starting to see some of the cost per shipment numbers, they're moderating.  If you take fuel out of the equation, just our core price inflation is starting to trend back to closer to what our expectations were for this year. So I feel like our team has done a phenomenal job with managing our cost and keeping that inflation in check as best we can in a low volume environment. I mean to produce a 7 2 3 in the second quarter with a 14% decrease in tonnage is pretty remarkable in my opinion.  But I think that we just got to stay consistent with our approach. And I think other carriers, they start making similar to what was going on in 2021. If other carriers are closing the pricing gap and are trying to use the environment to take even bigger increases, then I think that bodes well for our market share opportunities. We're typically a little bit more expensive than the other carriers on average, and so we'd be pleased to see that gap close, and that would certainly help support our own pricing initiatives as well.  But the key for us is to focus on us and what we're doing -- having that -- those conversations with customers demonstrating the value that we can add relative to the industry and just looking at what our needs would be to keep driving the cash from operations and the strength of our balance sheet even stronger to support further investments to keep growing the company. Yes. I see if I can try to address those in some sense of order, but to answer your first question from a mix standpoint, not a lot has changed with mix. Our weight per shipments dropped a little bit. We've gotten down to about -- we dropped about 10 pounds. We've gotten down to about 1,525 pound average or so, and it's dropped about 10 pounds or so here recently.  But not a lot is changing. I think some of that is, we are -- seems to be picking up some more of the smaller tariff-based customers that generally got a little bit lower weight per shipment. So that's been good to see, if you will, overall. And whether or not that continues remains to be seen.  And obviously, this is all just kind of developing. But I don't want to get into if we hold this trend steady, hold that trend steady, I mean, generally, August sequentially is up about 0.5% for our shipments per day are up about 0.5% over July. And we'd expect that some of this recent trend, it's possible that if things continue to hold steady like they have, I talked about the impact of July for that, but obviously, that could carry forward a little bit stronger, but we'll just take it 1 step at a time and keep giving the updates out there as they are.  But we were -- last year, in August, we were at about an average of 51,000 shipments per day. So it starts closing the gap, if you will, if we can hold 50,000 steady. But keep in mind and that's what I was alluding to earlier that there's a natural progression that happens from the beginning of the month to the end of the month, and we were already starting to see some trends.  So I don't know that you can't just take that gap from where we've been averaging 47,000 shipments a day really since December of last year and just say, okay, there's this immediate incremental change.  There's been change that's been developing. And you can't disappoint the one specific player to say, this is the reason why. It's been a developing trend, and it's the way history has played out for us. When we get to the end of the cycle, we start winning business from different carriers.  And so with that said, I think that there may be direct freight opportunities, but indirect trade opportunities as well that may come out of if there is an industry event. And I think that's still an if. And we don't know any more than anybody else. But we just are staying engaged with our customers, making sure that they understand the capacity that we have.  And I think everyone knows the service that we can offer and no different than I think 2021 is an example where freight was obviously coming to us very quickly that year, and we stepped up in a very big way through the second and third quarters. And a lot of the conversations that we had with shippers being will be similar conversations that we have now. We protect our existing customers capacity for them and that's how we would manage through if we get into another period where the freight opportunity is accelerating significantly. Yes. Tom, we're always looking for opportunities. And that's why we try to stay so far ahead of the growth curve. We generally are looking at each service center in each region and projecting out 5 years of potential growth to know where we're going to have facilities that start hitting capacity.  And those are the ones that go on our target list for kind of we roll out internally a 2-year capital expenditure plan to expand service center capacity and where we need it. So sometimes an opportunity presents itself that maybe we don't need this particular location, but in year 4, for example, but if it's a good facility, then we would go ahead and take advantage of it.  And again, it gets back to, we've got our long-term market share initiatives and what we think we can achieve over a longer period of time and so we know we're going to keep growing this network. We've been one of a few carriers that have been expanding. Many talk about it, but when you look over the last 10 years and you look at the capacity additions that we've made, the public carriers in total are actually down in terms of the number of service centers in the industry.  So we're going to continue to say that's a big part of our value proposition is, we're consistently investing dollars to be able to support our customers' growth and make sure that we can be there when our customers need us the most and when they've got growth potential but they need an LTL carrier to be able to respond, and we not just be able to respond in the middle of the month when things aren't as busy, but at the end of the month when they're trying to get the freight moved off the dock and deliver to their customers, that's 1 thing that they can rely on OD.  So we'll certainly continue to look for opportunities, and we would be opportunistic in adding facilities if it makes sense within the long-term vision for our network. Yes. This is Adam. But -- we've had a decrease in headcount or we do sequentially through the second quarter and we've seen attrition really going back into last year through our business. But I think that -- like I mentioned, there's 3 elements of capacity, and we certainly -- we've got plenty. We talk mostly about our service center piece. But we've got equipment capacity to respond to the acceleration in business levels and from a people standpoint, we can do the same.  We've shown that type of flex in our workforce in the past. I mean we've got people that I think we can call back as well. Marty mentioned, our internal truck driving school, that's created about 1/3 of our drivers and sometimes drivers come out of that school, but continue to work on the platform until demand is such that we put them into a full-time driving job.  So there's multiple opportunities. The other lever that we could pull. And we did this going back to looking at those 2021 sequential trends. But as business accelerated really through the second half of 2020 continuing through 2021 as needed, we don't like to do this, but we can use purchase transportation to supplement the capacity of our workforce or our fleet.  And so it just kind of depends on the pace at which volume comes on, but we had those big quarter-after-quarter sequential increases during those periods back in the end and that was kind of the final lever to pull. And -- so we certainly can have that. We would rather move our linehaul 100% of our fleet and with our people. But as necessary, we sometimes have to supplement, and that's kind of the source that we could go to on a very short-term basis. It would always be with the idea that we get it back 100% in-sourced as soon as possible if we had to go that route. Yes. And that we had had already talked about in the prepared comments, but it's somewhere 6.5% to 7% the revenue per hundredweight, excluding the fuel surcharge. Obviously, right now, we're getting -- continuing to see fuel that's down. I think July should be the worst.  At this point, we continue to average where we are fuel will be down about 30% again. But in the third quarter of last year was when fuel prices started declining, and then that continued on. So that will be less of a headwind, as we go through the second half of this year. But we're continuing to get core increases, as Marty mentioned earlier, and the key will be to continue to look at whether it's us or others, is there a sequential increase there.  That's what we strive every day, we've got contracts that are turning over. And we're going through those contracts and able to negotiate increases if mix is relatively constant, you should see sequential increases in those yield metrics. But like I mentioned, the last few days, we've been right at around 50,000 shipments per day. Some of that is just the natural growth that happens towards the end of the month. And whether it accelerates from there kind of remains to be seen. I held that 50,000 numbers that I gave this morning assumed that we kind of held that 50,000 constant for the remaining workdays, today through Friday and Monday of next week.  So if there's numbers that when we put them in our queue that are different from what we talked about today, then you can sort of judge from there where things came in. July of last year, was a little over 51,000 and 52,000 shipments per day and I mentioned, August was 50,000 to 51,000. So we're back to where our shipments per day if this kind of 50 were the hold content, and I'm not saying that it does, to where we're closer from a volume standpoint to where we were last year.  And then just sort of getting back to the -- keep trying to bring us back to the big picture, I think that success ain't going to be defined by what we can do next week and next month or next quarter, it's -- what's the market share potential over the long term, and we still feel confident about what our long-term market share potential can be because we still win business by the quality of our service.  Our value proposition is delivering superior service at a fair price and always maintaining network capacity to support our customers' growth. And I think we continue to win share because of the service and capacity advantages that we have in the marketplace, and that will extend beyond what may be happening over the next few weeks. Exactly. Slow and steady generally wins the rates, and we want to be patient with the things. And certainly, we're looking and having conversations with customers and want to help where we can. But just like in 2021, you got to be careful about opportunity.  You don't want to take on so much so fast that you end up not being able to deliver on the service value that we offer with 99% on time and on a claims ratio of 0.1%. So we want to be methodical about the way we go through this and make sure that we're protecting servicing capacity for our existing shippers without taking on too much of what opportunity may be out there.  And so I think when you go back and you look in prior trends, like I said, we stepped up in the second quarter more so than anyone else. When you look at 2021, when you look at that sequential acceleration, and then we continue to follow on from there where others didn't. So it's always just making sure that you don't over-extend yourself in the short term and just keep that eye on the ball for the long-term vision. It's really hard to try to bifurcate and put your finger on what's driving any type of acceleration there. As I've mentioned, we would expect to see an increase. We're going into the final full week of the month. We would expect to see a normal type of increase. And it's a little bit above where I'd originally forecast this week to be at least, but when I go back to Friday was a bit heavier and then Monday and Tuesday have been a little bit heavier than what I had originally looked at.  And so is that just because we've got more business from an existing customer that's having their own end of month surge? Yes, that's part of it. Is it freight that's coming in, we're -- there's been some freight diversion? Yes, that's a part of it.  So you just can't put your finger on everything when we're doing 50,000 shipments a day, why did we get this 1 particular shipment? But that's why I wanted to point out that really, I think this goes back to, for several weeks, I feel like we've seen some pretty nice trends. We closed out the month of June strong.  I feel like when we go back, even though our number of shipments per day have been around 47,000, we've had some good end-of-month performance. And the trends, the intra-month trends have been pretty good the last couple of months as well. We dropped off some early in the month, which that's typical too, but maybe dropping off a little bit more so than what a week-by-week average would be.  But then we've made up for it as we've progressed through the month. So I've been pleased with our performance so far in July and it looks like at least right now when we project out and carry that trend forward of shipments per day that we're still down in comparison to June. Some of that is July is a 20-workday month and the way the July 4 holiday fell that Monday that we were open was probably half of a normal workday. So if you kind of adjust for that, we had seen better trends.  We have been more in the 48,000-or-so shipments per day range kind of through the month before this recent pickup happened. So it's just not -- I can't put your finger on what completely is driving the change other than you go back and this is somewhat typical to what we would see at the end of a slow period like we've been in since April of last year and then it's just been accelerated over the last few work days from there. We keep our belts tight every day. So we're always looking at managing our variable cost and controlling discretionary spending where we can and where it makes sense. But that's a philosophy that you can't just sort of take it or leave it. It's a mindset that you have to stay in, in good times and in bad. If you don't have that mindset in the good times, you're not going to be able to switch gears when you really need to.  So I think that we certainly have been able to trim out some cost and I was pleased we ended up with a better operating ratio in the second quarter than what we had initially talked about. So that was good to see. And I think that I mentioned earlier, we're going to have some of those overhead cost categories.  Overhead costs are about 19.5% to 20% of our revenue in total when he split those out and our direct costs are 2.5% to 53% of revenue. We're going to have some cost increases. We're continuing to have depreciation dollars that will increase from the second to the third quarter.  Our general supplies and expenses should be up in the third quarter over the second. And then I would expect that our miscellaneous expenses would be up as well. So those dollar costs will be there. Whether or not we've got some revenue growth to offset them kind of remains to be seen similar to what we were talking about before. So -- but some of those dollars will be increasing from the second to the third. Typically, that plays out exactly as you described. where it may find a temporary home, but then ultimately, and in some cases, people have just got to get their freight moved and they may go to the next closest carrier from a price standpoint. And just to keep their supply chain moving. But ultimately, if they want value in their supply chain, that freight will find a home at Old Dominion. Yes. We saw generally consistent performance in the second quarter with the industrial and our retail-related customers. Industrial is 55% to 60% of our business overall. And historically, we look at ISM and industrial production, which I assume has been below 50 or at or below 50, I think, for 9 months now and that generally reconciles with the industry volumes.  And certainly aligns with the second quarter when we were down 14%. But overall, we think that some of the conversations that we've had that we get the sense that inventory levels are normalizing a bit. That's kind of supported my baseline thinking of getting back to some consistency with volumes going into the second half of this year. And that would be back in alignment with what our normal sequential trends are with volumes anyways.  Typically, in the third quarter, our shipments are up about 1.5% to 2% over the second quarter. And then we generally have about a 3.5% decrease in the fourth quarter. So we've been -- there's been a pretty wide gap between our sequential -- actual sequential trends relative to the 10-year average for the past few quarters. So I felt like we were -- in a normalized environment, we're going to get back to closer to those 10-year average trends and then hopefully then get back to seeing real growth once we got into 2024.  But -- so it seems like some of the tea leaves and some of the conversations that we've had with customers would suggest this normalization and then freight actually picking up and moving again, which was the positive that we were looking at and thinking about and planning for in terms of the second half of this year in 2024.  And then obviously, we've had some recent developments that have accelerated things a little further here over the last week-or-so. Yes. Like I said earlier, and we've talked about this on recent calls. From a core contract customer standpoint, we've actually had good trends. And when we look at having a double-digit decrease in volumes that may seem counterintuitive. But certainly, the economy has weighed on many customers and has impacted their trends.  But when we look at our our national account business and the wins that we've had versus losses, we continue to have the good wins and have not really lost any share to speak of with those larger national accounts, but they've just had reduced volumes.  We have lost and have talked about our business levels with third-party logistics companies has been down in recent quarters and that was still negative in the second quarter as well. But that's something where I think that certainly shippers have been looking to save cost and they've been using the 3PLs to find carriers that had a little cheaper price than us maybe and divert some freight away for that reason.  But I think now, just like we've seen in prior cycles, servicing capacity are coming squarely back into focus for many shippers. And so I think that lends itself to how we've won market share over the long term. So there's not necessarily any one piece of business that's changing any more than others. We've got a lot of consistency within our largest accounts, and these are long-term strong relationships that we have between us and our customers.  And so our sales team, our pricing team, they're staying in front of our customers and staying engaged and making sure that they know we're here when they need us. And we're increasingly getting those inbound phone calls and being able to take on some incremental business.  So it's good to see, but we still would like to see the overall macro environment improving, would love to see the ISM going back above 50 and really talking about more of a true improvement in the underlying demand environment versus what the supply situation in the industry might be."

Thank you for your cooperation. At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Gantt. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gantt: Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team started this year with first quarter financial results that included revenue of $1.4 billion, an operating ratio of 73.4% and earnings per diluted share of $2.58. These numbers were slightly below our first quarter results from 2022 and reflect the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and the challenging operating environment. We are also coming off a record year in 2022 where revenue and profits were at an all-time high. As we started this year, we were cautiously optimistic that our business levels would start to improve late in the first quarter and accelerate further in the second quarter. While our volumes stabilized during January and February as expected, we have not seen the acceleration in volumes that was originally anticipated. Our shipments per day have remained consistent on a daily basis so far this year, but on a year-over-year basis, shipments in April are trending down double digits. Fortunately, our market share has remained relatively consistent and our yield continues to improve. We believe the stability with our market share during the first quarter reflects the value of our service offering and the success of our long term strategic plan. The guiding principles of this plan have been in place for many years and have helped us produce a strong track record for long term profitable growth throughout the economic cycle. This plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price to our customers, and we remain committed to providing on-time service and claims free service as well. We will continue to focus on delivering a value proposition to our customers while also maintaining a disciplined approach to managing the fundamental aspects of our business. This will include making the best decisions to help us navigate through a challenging environment in the short term while also positioning us for future opportunities to produce long term profitable growth. While we like to measure our success over years, we believe it takes winning on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to add up to long term success. Our consistent focus and successful balance of long term opportunities against short term trends has helped us achieve a 10 year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of 11.4% and 25%, respectively. I want to close my last earnings call as CEO by saying how incredibly proud I am of the entire OD family of employees, all 23,000 of us, and the track record of success that we have produced together. I am encouraged by the prospects that our team has for future growth. Without any doubt, I stand firm in my belief that OD has the strongest team in the industry, the best service in the industry and is better positioned than any LTL carrier to continue to win market share, while also increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning.  And now I will turn things over to Marty for further discussion of the first quarter.\nMarty Freeman: Thank you, Greg, and good morning. I want to, first of all, start by thanking Greg for his leadership and significant contributions to OD over his career, while also recognizing each OD employee for their critical role in our success. Together, we have produced remarkable improvement in our financial and operating results over the long term. And I can assure you that OD's team remains focused on continuing our record of strong profitable growth. With respect to our first quarter, we delivered solid financial results, especially when considering the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and decrease in volumes. Although these factors contributed to the first decrease in quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share since the second quarter of 2020, our market share has remained relatively consistent. As a result, we believe our decrease in volumes was largely due to some shippers simply having fewer shipments than normal due to the economy. Although there have been others that are beginning to emphasize price versus service and choosing lower priced carriers. The operating environment has become more challenging than we anticipated and the expected acceleration in volumes has obviously not occurred. Despite these factors, we have maintained a commitment to our long term strategic plan. We will continue to focus on providing shippers with superior service to support our ability to maintain our price discipline. Our consistent cost based approach to manage yield and account profitability has been critical to our ability to improve our financial position over time, which has helped us support and continued investments in technology and service center capacity. While capacity is not currently an industry issue due to the weakness in industry volumes, we believe this will once again become a critical differentiator for us when the economy improves. We believe our long term consistent investment in service center capacity has been and remains a strategic advantage that supports our long term market share goals. During this period of revenue decline, we will also maintain a disciplined approach to managing our variable cost and discretionary spending to protect our profitability. This starts with a commitment to maximizing the operating efficiency of our fleet and network. Some of our productivity measurements in the first quarter were negatively impacted by the general loss of operating density associated with the decrease in our shipments and weight per shipment. This was evidenced by a 4.9% decrease in our linehaul latent load average and a 1% decrease in our P&D shipments per hour. We improved our platform productivity, however, and generated a 5.8% increase in our platform shipments per hour. We also reduced our reliance on purchase transportation as compared to the first quarter of 2022, which allowed us to improve the overall efficiency of our operations. This contributed to the improvement in our variable cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter. We will also continue to work on improving the efficiency of our operations as we make our way through the balance of this year, which provides an opportunity to generate additional cost savings. While productivity is always a focus, we cannot and we will not allow it to impact our best-in-class service performance. Our team continued to deliver superior service during the first quarter with an on-time service of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. This service performance remains critical to support our yield management strategies. We have said many times before that to produce long term improvement in our operating ratio will continue to require a balance between operating density and yield management, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. As just mentioned, we lost operating density in the quarter in the current environment due to the decline in volumes and the expansion of our network. Our yield has continued to consistently improve, however, and revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 8.6% during the first quarter. We will continue to demonstrate value to our customers by balancing our superior service offering with a consistent cost based approach to our pricing. The resulting value proposition is unmatched in the LTL industry and will continue to support our ability to increase market share over the long term. As we look forward to remaining quarters of this year, we currently anticipate the softer demand environment will continue. The second quarter is generally the period when volumes begin to accelerate, but we have yet to see an inflection towards growth. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes that might occur if and when the economy improves. Until that time comes, we will continue to focus on managing our costs and delivering value to our customers through our value proposition of on-time claims free service at a fair price. Delivering value is a central element of our long term strategic plan and we remain committed to execute on this plan regardless of the economic cycle. As a critical part of this plan, we will also continue to execute our capital expenditure program and most importantly, invest in the training, education and development of our OD family of employees. The economy will eventually recover and we are confident that when it does, our team's execution will allow us to achieve further growth and profitability while also increasing our shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today. Adam will now discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 3.7% in the first quarter of 2023 due to an 11.9% decrease in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by 9.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 0.8% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $2.58 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.9% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 with the LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.4%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a 0.5% decrease in tonnes per day and a 0.2% increase in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in the LTL tonnes per day during the first quarter were as follows. January decreased 1.0% as compared with December, February decreased 0.2% versus January and March increased 0.7% as compared to February. The 10 year average change for the respective months was an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.2% in March. Our shipments per day over these same periods were relatively consistent on a sequential basis and increased slightly each month as we progressed through the first quarter. While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% when compared to April of 2022. Our LTL tonnage per day has also decreased by approximately 15%, while revenue per hundredweight has increased approximately 1% when including fuel surcharges and increased approximately 7.5% excluding fuel surcharges. Our revenue and shipment counts on a daily basis have been relatively consistent in April when compared to March of this year, except for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. As previously mentioned, however, we had expected to see acceleration in business levels by this point in the year based on customer feedback and our historical planning process. While we would like to see our market share continue to increase again, we believe that it's more important to maintain our price discipline during this period of economic weakness, while positioning ourselves to emerge from a slow period with capacity and a better opportunity to produce strong profitable growth over the long term. We have operated in scenarios like this before and we will continue to execute our plan and adjust to this lower than expected volume environment until an inflection point happens and we can shift back into growth mode again. Our first quarter operating ratio increased to 73.4% for the first quarter as the improvements in our direct operating costs did not sufficiently offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our fixed cost categories increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter due to the deleveraging effect associated with the decrease in revenue as well as the timing and significance of certain expenditures. In particular, our depreciation and amortization costs increased 80 basis points and general supplies and expenses increased 30 basis points. Within our direct operating costs, our purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue improved 140 basis points, while our productive labor cost improved 50 basis points. These changes more than offset the 50 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that was primarily due to an increase in our maintenance and repair costs. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $415.4 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $234.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million this year, which is a $100 million decrease from our initial capital expenditure plan. We plan to continue with real estate expansion projects that are already in process and others that we believe will be critical to our long term operating plan. We also plan to continue to purchase new equipment, which we believe will help lower the average age of our fleet and help reduce our maintenance cost per mile. We utilized $141.7 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $44.1 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% and 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the second quarter of 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Maybe just a two parter here, one is the uptick in April that didn't materialize. In your conversations with your customers, do you get a sense that this is just a pause while they figure out what's going on with the banking crisis and other things before they resume and their inventory is in a better situation, or do you think the rebound is kind of completely pushed out maybe to '24? And also maybe as a follow-up, can you help us think about kind of fuel surcharge and how we think about that math through the rest of the year?\nAdam Satterfield: Certainly, it's been difficult to read the tea leaves this year, and we felt like we've had a lot of good conversations with customers and continue to have them. But certainly, it seemed like the whole banking issue was a bit of cold water on the economy overall. I think that it just continues to be a challenging overall and people question in some cases the direction of the economy and continue to be somewhat conservative as a result. But I think our business, we obviously have been talking about probably since the third quarter of last year, an expectation that we would start seeing an uptick, and it didn't happen. Things have stabilized, we continue to be consistent. We continue to have good conversations though. And I would say within our direct business, having conversations with customers, we're seeing an increase in some of these accounts. When I look through our top 50 accounts, business that's not with the 3PL, we're seeing a good increase. We actually saw an increase in revenue with those accounts during the first quarter. Some of our business with 3PLs is suffering a little more. Like we said in our prepared comments, we're seeing some shippers that are prioritizing price over service right now, but you've got a lot of others. And I think that's why we're seeing the increase in our direct business that continue to think strategically about their supply chain, understand the value that we're delivering and know that this environment will turn again. And we helped many of these customers through challenging times and the pandemic and then the supply chain crisis that followed. So I think it's a mixed bag across the board but we continue to stay engaged, we're continuing to have favorable conversations. And it's just a matter of when the economy eventually recovers and we're certainly prepared for when that happens. It's just day in and day out. Our shipments per day have just been pretty consistent, pretty much all through the first quarter, and that's continuing into April.\nRavi Shanker: And the fuel surcharge, is there any color that would be great.\nAdam Satterfield: Certainly, the fuel surcharge, this is the quarter we talked about. It actually happened in March. In March, the average price per gallon was down about 18%. Right now with fuel being $4.10 somewhere in that range, fuel prices are down about 25%. So certainly, we'll see a bigger decrease on a year-over-year basis of fuel surcharges. That's end of the April number that we put out. Already, fuel in April is down about 20%. And so that's driving some of that 15% decrease that we're seeing in our April revenues on a year-over-year basis. But I think the impact is evident in our yield metrics. We're continuing to see good yield increases. As we're going through bids and whatnot, we're continuing to talk about our cost plus increases that are necessary. But when we look at April and kind of where things are, the revenue per hundredweight continues to be solid. And we would expect to see sequential increase in the second quarter over the first quarter. That number should naturally start to trend back closer to what our longer term averages have been from just a core yield increase standpoint, but the revenue per hundredweight with the fuel is reflecting that change now in fuel prices and the fuel surcharge. So that is starting to flatten out, if you will, just like the numbers that we talked about for what we've seen month-to-date for April.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens.\nJack Atkins: So I guess, I'd love to, Adam, get your thoughts on operating ratio progression sequentially. Obviously, this is not a normal second quarter, at least it's not starting off as a normal second quarter in terms of how April is trending. Any way to kind of help us think about the puts and takes in terms of the OR progression first quarter to second quarter relative to normal seasonality?\nAdam Satterfield: This is certainly -- it's definitely not a usual type of quarter, as you said. I mean, with tonnage being down about 15%, it's been since '09, since we've seen that type of change or maybe back to the second quarter of '20 when the pandemic happened and the world shutdown. But it's something that we've been consistently adjusting to. And frankly, we knew the second quarter comparisons were going to be more challenging this year when we looked through the balance of how the quarters would fall. But the buildup in March that we anticipated obviously didn't happen, that's where you start really getting a lot of that growth, really it happened throughout the first quarter. But March is typically a pretty good increase when you look at things on a shipments per day standpoint that should be up 5% or so. Right now, like I mentioned before, we're seeing shipments per day that's just pretty steady on a day in and day out basis coming in at somewhere around 47,000 shipments per day. And granted the April will have the impact, we don't do half day conventions, but we pretty much have about a half a day loss with the Good Friday and the Easter holidays. But if we don't come off of that number -- and I'll tell you, it's not like we're picking up the same 47,000 shipments day in and day out, we're getting increases with some accounts while others were seeing decreases with. It's not as easy as maybe as what that sounds as it's consistent day in and day out. But if we don't see any further growth from there, we should see it in May, just the natural effect of just like the impact of the holidays, recovering from that, a little bit of growth and if we can move forward from there. But overall, for the quarter, if we're still in this environment where there's no sequential increase then we're looking at revenues that might be flattish in the second quarter with the first as compared to we're normally up about 10% on a per day basis. So if that's the scenario that we're in then I think that we're looking at an operating ratio that may be more consistent with the first quarter and could see some slight deterioration from there. I think our challenge will continue to be managing our direct variable cost, that's a productive labor, our operating supplies and expenses and so forth. If we're in the same type of shipments per day environment, managing those costs flat, maybe with some slight improvement as a percent of revenue, those were about 54% of revenue in the first quarter. And then from an overhead standpoint, those costs were about 19.5% in the first quarter. We'll continue to have an increase in the aggregate amount of depreciation expenses and some other dollars of overhead that might increase. So those costs could increase further as a percent of revenue from that 19.5%. But for us, it's certainly challenging. But I can tell you our teams were looking at costs, were looking at productivity, were looking at the size of the fleet and making adjustments on a day by day basis trying to get in and save costs where we can. But like we mentioned before, doing all the right things that position us to come out of this downturn even stronger. And that's when the inflection when it happens when we really outperform for the longest time when we get into these slower macro periods, our market share is generally flatter as we maintain our price discipline. But then when we come out, that's when we really see the outperformance in our volumes versus the industry. So we're going to continue to -- with the same strategic plan that's got us to where we are today and I think that we'll emerge from this thing even stronger.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: One thing I just want to clarify and then I have my actual question. So Adam, your comment about OR may be flattish 1Q to 2Q, is that -- that's assuming that there's none of the seasonal May and June uptick. Is that -- am I understanding that right?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, assuming a little bit just the natural uptick that would happen in the sense of our May volumes should be somewhere -- I mean, where we are today, if they stay at this 47,000 range, it'd be a slight uptick over April just because of April being impacted by that half day that I mentioned for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. But you're correct. Just assuming that we stay in this sort of malaise where we don't see any incremental uptick and frankly, no decline either, but just staying in this flattish on a sequential basis, we certainly hope that there will be an uptick in volumes. We've seen some good trends, good couple of days this week. But I think that we certainly need to be mindful of kind of where we are and the fact that we don't see that positive inflection from an economic standpoint happening. And so I think we do need to talk about kind of where we are today. Obviously, we give our mid-quarter update. So if the inflection happens and we start seeing some growth, we're certainly ready and can handle it. And that's when we can start maybe talking about seeing some incremental improvement, if you will, relative to the first quarter. But right now, it's just things on a day in, day out basis are -- have just been very steady as she goes from a revenue per day and a shipments per day standpoint.\nScott Group: And then when you talk about volume down the most since '09, I guess I just want to understand like the pricing is holding up for you really, really well. At what point does that get tougher, are you seeing any signs of competitive pressure, just given the market continuing to get worse right now from a volume standpoint?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I mean it's certainly -- one, I think the comparison is a little bit tougher and that should get better as we progress through this year, even if our numbers were to stay flatter, the numbers should start to show a little bit of improvement. But it's still a really soft environment out there. And I think that we've demonstrated a lot of value and that's what we continue to talk about with our customers. And our costs continue to go up and we need increases. We've invested a lot in our network over the years, over the last 10 years, about $4.5 billion of capital expenditures to grow our service center network, to be and have capacity where our customers need us and to have the right fleet and the right team to be able to continue to deliver value to our customers. So we've invested a lot and we intend to continue to invest. So I think that, that doesn't change the conversations that we're having with shippers. But in some cases due to the economy and due to internal pressures, there are some shippers that got to look for cheaper price carriers. And we're a premium carrier, premium service and our price is generally a little bit higher than others. And so oftentimes we'll hear feedback though from shippers that are making that short term decision that they're doing it to meet internal thresholds and intend to give the volume back to us. Like I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit more transactional volume loss within our 3PL book of business right now, that's about a third of our overall revenue in the first quarter. 3PLs were down a little worse than the company average revenue change. So that's something that would continue to be mindful of. And that too often flips and kind of ebbs and flows with the economy. But I think for us, it's just got have a plan, and we have one and stay disciplined to it and just keep our focus on delivering service. That comes at a cost. There becomes a fixed element of running our linehaul network and our P&D system to be able to continue to deliver service. And usually, this is when service breakdown occurs in the industry. When you become very focused on mitigating cost and I think we're in a much stronger position than every other carrier. But when you start focusing on trying to mitigate cost in this type of environment when the other carriers have seen worse volume loss than us on average, that's when trailers start getting hailed longer to try to fill them up and on-time service starts declining, claims start increasing, other bad things happen, that really, I think, or at least what we've seen in the past, we see a widening of the gap from a service performance on us versus the industry. So we expect that will play out again. And when the economy starts recovering, it's obviously tough to manage through it on a day-by-day basis. But I think we get right back to our market share gains. I don't think anything has changed in the sense of what we think our long term market share potential can be, what our long term operating ratio goals are. None of that really changes. It just kind of news when the start point begins when we get back into market share growth mode again.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Marty, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, and Adam, you've kind of addressed it in a couple of your answers as well. But customers choosing price over service, have you seen any kind of significant cracks in the pricing dynamic, given just the complete weakness in the volume side? And how would you compare kind of the pricing environment today versus other periods of recessionary volume backdrop?\nGreg Gantt: I've been through this a few times in my 40 years in transportation. And I think the worst I've ever seen was 2009 and we're nowhere near that. But there is some challenging pricing out there as there always is during low freight levels. Most of it we see is transactional mom-and-pop type shippers and inbound customers. So yes, it can be challenging out there but it's not anything we haven't seen before and it's not anything we can't work through and manage through.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: I think I said this on the last call maybe, but if I didn't, congratulations, Greg, on the retirement and the great run you had. I actually want to ask along those lines, I guess, you've seen -- you're retiring, someone on the teams moved to a competitor, there's some degree of change going on, that will take place with the OD team. How do you think that may affect what you're doing at OD, what might be some of the risks around that? Are there risks around that, are there potential things that you say, well, this was my approach obviously tremendously successful, but the next person might tweak things a bit. So I know that's kind of anticipatory. But just thoughts on some of the management things that are -- have taken place or will take place as you retire?\nGreg Gantt: I don't mind addressing that at all. I appreciate the question. But fortunately, Tom, we've got a tremendously strong team here at OD. The folks replacing me have merely as many years in some cases in the industry as I do. They are all 20 plus year veterans, they've been through everything since we started executing this plan many years ago. They've been through the thick and thin and the good times, the bad times, and they know who we are and they know what's made us successful. They understand our plan going forward. And I think we're in a great position to continue to execute on that plan. So Tom, there's always risk. Anytime you lose good people, certainly, there's risk. But I feel extremely good about where we are. We'll make the replacement and continue to move forward. Again, thankfully, we had a plan, a plan to execute on my exit, if you will, and promoted the folks that certainly are capable of continuing to drive our results forward. So again, I feel good about it. I'm not concerned about that far at all. These guys know what to do and, hey, I feel extremely good about it. We got a great team. You can see that in the results. It's not me, it's not just the folks here. But I think everybody truly understands what we're trying to do and how we're supposed to execute and handle customers' business on a daily basis, and that's not going to change just because I'm out the door or any other one person left. Those fundamental things that we know how to do much better than our competitors, that's not going to change any time soon. So I think the basics of blocking and tackling those kind of things without any doubt, we're far superior to all of our competitors, again, that's not going to change. So I think we're in a good spot. And hey, I look forward to a whole lot of success down the road for OD.\nOperator: The next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just let me go back to the comment on the top of the accounts. You did say there were actually some that were improving here. I guess any color that we can maybe read through in vertical or such that that's driving some of that improvement? And I guess, along with that, that stabilization when you kind of think of those larger customers, do you at least -- I know we don't have a view on the inflection, but at least the stabilization may hold? Just any color there.\nAdam Satterfield: It was pretty consistent performance between our retail and industrial customer base during the quarter. The revenue levels were generally about the same for both. But like I mentioned earlier, it's really a lot of the business that we're seeing, there's probably a little bit worse decline with business that's managed by 3PLs. And so that's fairly typical in a softer environment, if you will, and so not wholly unexpected completely. But yes, we've seen just a consistency day in and day out with business levels in terms of the number of shipments per day that we've seen, it's been trending around 47,000 bills a day and we don't necessarily see that inflection point, if you will, happening. Typically, you would start seeing an increase, you'd see an increase in May of about 2.5% to 3% and then a further increase from May to June of 2%. And certainly, we'd like to think that that might happen. But if you go back to when things really started decreasing, it was last year in April. March of last year was the last month where we had a nice sequential increase. Our business in February of last year was up about 5%. It was up another 3% in March. But then we started dropping off and basically have been flat to down for every month thereafter. And our shipments have been pretty consistent, they've increased very, very slightly, less than 1% each month. So pretty much consistent as we made our way through each month of the first quarter, pretty much had been the same in April, again, other than those two days that we consider full days impacted by the holiday, but that's in our normal number. Typically, April would be up about 0.5% over March. And right now, we're down about 2.5% shipments per day. So that's some of that where we've just seen that consistent trend day in and day out. So do we start seeing some increase? Like I mentioned before, May just naturally should show a little bit of growth if we stay at this 47,000 bill level. And do we start growing from there? Do we see 1% or growth in June? I'd like to think that we would. And again, we've had a lot of good conversations. We've had some good hits here lately with customers. But some of those same conversations we were having three months ago where we were positive as well. So I think that right now, we just want to be conservative, if you will, and we're continuing to try to manage our costs down to this lower level of shipments. And I think that will continue to happen as we progress through the years. We focus on productivity. We're a little heavy with our fleet now as well and we're working through some of those challenges. But just trying to get everything balanced as best as we can while we stay in this sort of stable period, if you will. But it's just not really seeing any kind of growth. But I'd say typically, April volumes from a shipments per day standpoint typically are fairly consistent with what our year-to-date average is, and we've seen that over time other than in 2020. And so that's something that we just sort of keep in mind from a planning standpoint. And we always have a plan for -- we have a baseline plan, we've talked about this before that we enter every year with and then we have a bull scenario and a bear scenario. And '21 was more at that bull case scenario and this year is more in the bear. So we start with a plan, if things materialize like this, and that's about at the level where we are and we're executing on that plan.\nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Quick question. When was the last time shipments in 2Q were worse than 1Q? I don't know or I don't think there's ever been a time that that's been the case. But if you can just help me with that? And then when does the drawdown on weights abate, we're at 1,550 now. Are we at the point where we stabilize at these levels? So those two points. And then Adam, historically, you've lost lanes in past downturns to high quality regional players or maybe lower cost. I don't think that's happened maybe up until now. I don't know if that's happening now that maybe explain some of the weakness in April. But if you can talk about kind of what the customers are doing from a trade down effect to some of the regional, maybe equally or as high quality players?\nAdam Satterfield: From a second quarter to first quarter standpoint, other than the second quarter of '20 when the world shutdown, we've not really seen a decrease in shipments. And that too kind of played into our general thinking, even years like 2009, 2016, 2019, weaker years, we still had some marginal improvement in shipments in the second quarter versus the first. And so right now, that's kind of trending flattish. We'll see how things shake out for the remainder of the period. And like I said, maybe we'll get some growth. And certainly, it will be out there as we put our mid quarter update, we'll put the final April update in our 10-Q. And if we see some continued acceleration this week that will be in the number, but we just don't see a big inflection point happening like we did in, say, 2017 that spurred that growth of '17 through '18 and what we saw in the back part of 2020 that continue to accelerate through '21 like it happened. And so we're still waiting for that point but we don't see it kind of on the near term. And so we just managed to kind of where we are. But yes, that's kind of the challenge in what we're seeing. It's partly why I mentioned earlier that our revenues in the second quarter are typically up 9%, 10% and that's why we always get so much margin improvement in the second quarter as well. And so that becomes the challenge as we manage through this particular period. But with respect to your other question on the customer base, I don't know that we're seeing significant loss other than that's some of what's going on underneath, I think, with some of the 3PL business, that they can leverage their carrier relationships and move some freight, and some of this is transactional as well. But they can take advantage of relationships and see who has capacity and who's got a cheaper price and move some business away. But that's some of the feedback where we've heard customers coming to us and saying, look, I need to do this to meet my own call center objectives, if there's an internal mandate to save X dollars that they've got to try to meet in some way. But generally speaking, that freight comes back to us. If we ever lose freight, it's on price, but we generally always gain it back for service quality and capacity down the road. So we're confident that -- but that trend will continue to play out again and that we'll see any of this freight loss eventually come back to us. It's just a matter of -- it seems like that's being pushed further down the road than the inflection point that we thought would happen beginning with this spring.\nAmit Mehrotra: What about weight?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, weight per shipment. I guess you've embedded three questions in one, but -- and my memory was short. Yes, our weight per shipment, it's down a little bit further. I think we're getting to the stabilization point. Right now in April, it's about 1,525 pounds. Historically, we would get down in lower periods to about 1,550 pounds or so. But if you recall, we made some strategic decisions in '21 and exited from some of the spot heavier type shipments, these 8,000, 10,000 pound type loads and that had an effect of really lowering our overall weight per shipment. So despite the weakness, we're not going back and trying to bring in freight that we didn't think fit our network for the long term. So just going along with the economy, we've seen a little further deceleration and that weight per shipment being down to 1,525 pounds. So that's a little bit worse. April is always usually down 0.5% or 1% off of March. Some of that is March builds up at the end of the quarter, but we're down a little bit more. But I feel like that's stabilizing that probably our low watermark in a softer economy will be 1,525, 1,530 pounds maybe. But yes, we think that's getting to a stabilization point or so it seems.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Adam, just kind of curious how you think about headcount going forward here? Obviously, a lack of seasonality might influence this, but you've been bringing it down sequentially the last few quarters. Just want to get a sense maybe how much more room you have in terms of rightsizing that labor force? And maybe is there a line where you feel like you don't necessarily want to go beyond?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, it's continued to drift lower on a sequential basis. The average was down about 3.5% in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But our peak, if you will, for full time headcount was in May of last year. And through normal attrition and just some places making other decisions, if you will, just balancing our number of employees with the freight volumes that exist, we've had to work through those on a case-by-case basis throughout our 255 locations. But I expect that, that will continue to drift a little bit lower as attrition continues to happen from where we are today through the end of June. And we're getting to a point, I think, that if you kind of compare where we are, if we continue to drift maybe 1% or 2% lower as we progress through the second quarter to where the year-over-year change by the end of June maybe in that 9% to 10% type of range, and then that's coming back into balance. We've always talked about the change in headcount typically reconciles with the overall change in shipment count as well. And so you know if we're looking at that, I think by the end of June, that change in shipments on a month-over-month basis, those two numbers may start coming back into payer team with one another. That is the change in full time employees and the change in our shipments on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: You've been pretty open about some of the share and pricing challenges with 3PL business. Can you walk us through a little bit on how that emerges. Are you seeing larger carriers reduce their rates across the board with 3PLs and losing business that way, or is this more targeted dynamic pricing? And just if that cyclical dynamic, which I'm sure has been around before, if that is evolving any differently this cycle than last cycle, we'd love to hear more about it?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think it's hard for us to say. We don't always know the reasons behind. I mean the feedback we get is that someone's cheaper. We don't know necessarily that variance or that reason why. I think that we're obviously one of the first carriers to report and just continue to watch what the others are doing, what their numbers are looking like and hear what the others have to say, I think. Others have said that they've got price discipline but we've seen one carrier's yield flatten out. So I think all we can do is just continue to sort of watch and and see what others are doing, but that doesn't impact what we do. We've got a plan, we stay committed to it, and we know what value we deliver and we just got to stay disciplined, and that's what we'll do. So it's never good to kind of live through it in a moment and we've done this time and time again. But like I said, it's not totally unexpected to see some of that business just given the softness in the economic environment and cost challenges that people are facing in general to be looking at ways they might be able to save on price in the current term. But what we always say is price doesn't equal cost. We deliver value to our customers. And when you consider total cost of transportation, when you deliver 99% on time and have a claims ratio of 0.1% and you save money by shipping with Old Dominion and that's what our position continues to be, demonstrate value. We\u2019ve got to continue to maintain our service metrics, and we will, that is certainly a focus for us, and we'll manage through this. But like we said before and I think it's played out when you look at our numbers and the long term improvement that we've made with respect to our margins and the cash from operations that we generate and are able to reinvest back in our business on behalf of our customers, we've got to maintain our disciplined approach. And I think that it's proven itself out in the long run and is a key difference why our numbers look a lot different from some of the others.\nBascome Majors: But when you look back to 2019 or 2016, does the rising competitiveness on price and share of the 3PL channel feel different this time? Just curious if this all rhymes or something feels like it's changed here?\nAdam Satterfield: No I wouldn't say it\u2026\nGreg Gantt: It's maybe a little bit different basket, but not wholly and completely. And just to add a little color to what Adam said, generally speaking with our 3PLs, we're not losing contractual business. Some of those contractual accounts maybe down just because the general economy is slower, they may possibly be down but that's not where we're losing. And the transactional stuff, as Adam talked about before, that's where we're seeing a deterioration in our revenue with those specific 3PLs. They all have a large piece of business that's transactional, that customers may ship once twice whatever a week, smaller type accounts and that's where we're seeing the losses from our standpoint. So it's just business that they can price on the fly. And we're never going to be the low cost guy on the fly, if you will. So anyway, that's more of what we've seen. It's not losing business by any stretch.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Greg, good luck in retirement and maybe [West] might be giving you a call soon\u2026\nGreg Gantt: I'm not sure that with me being on this board and that one\u2026\nKen Hoexter: Marty, I just want to clarify, I just want to make sure I heard you right. Did you say this is not abnormal in terms of the part of the cycle on pricing? And then my question for Adam or Greg, I guess, is just the ability to be fluid on cost, right? So you've always talked about more so than peers given the fixed cost structure of the less than truckload market, and OD is focused on keeping people. How do you shift -- how do you think about shifting costs or what moves you make now with volumes down 15%? I know you always want to be prepared and have the 25% capacity available, but what do you think about on the cost and impact OR?\nGreg Gantt: This is not abnormal in this type of environment, economic environment. You have -- some of our competitors, they think offering a more competitive or lower price will keep the customer there. Many times, it does not because the customer will always come back to having their cargo delivered on time and claim free. We've learned that over the years. So it's not abnormal. We choose to tighten our belt and manage our labor. And when the slow times pass, we're in a great position to keep our OR going downwards though. But it's not abnormal to see low prices in any environment with any company. So we've seen it before and it will pass like it always does. And Adam, I'll let you handle the\u2026\nAdam Satterfield: I would only say on the call standpoint, I mean, obviously, we've switched to where our variable costs or the majority of our cost base now, probably 70% or more of our costs now are variable in nature. And obviously, we've got a big fixed cost base and we're seeing the loss leverage with the revenue decline there driving some of that. But some of the increase in those overhead costs in the first quarter also comes from the fact that we're on a little bit of a different schedule with respect to our equipment plan. We were taking delivery in the fourth quarter of equipment, taken delivery in the first quarter, which is unusual and that was part of why we had anticipated a sequential increase in those depreciation costs as a percent of revenue. But given all the challenges from a fleet standpoint, that's driving some of our costs. It's also driving some of the maintenance and repair costs, like I mentioned. We're seeing an increase in cost per mile. Some of that is just due to general inflation related to parts and repairs. But some of it, too, just relates to the fact that we're bringing in equipment. We've -- on a different schedule, we've held equipment through '21 and '22 and our average fleet age has increased as a result. We're -- probably our average fleet age is about five and half years now, we like it to be around four years. And so we'll work on balancing that as we take out some of the older equipment from the fleet and adjusting our fleet, if you will, to the lower shipment levels and that will help from a cost and an efficiency standpoint. But 80% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits and ops supplies and expenses. And linehaul is a big element underneath that. And so that's why we've got to stay disciplined. We mentioned in our prepared comments about our linehaul load factor being down like it is. I can tell you that's a focus, that's a lot of dollars, not only from a labor standpoint, but that's what creates the miles that we run. And so that's -- we can drive some improvement there, that will help us from both labor and fuel, in particular, while we're also making some adjustments on the fleet that will help with both depreciation and maintenance costs. But like I think I said earlier, there's an element that becomes fixed -- about every variable cost is fixed in the short run. And if we want to continue to deliver service and we are, there becomes a fixed element within that linehaul component. And so we've got to be able to do both, frankly. We're not going to lose our focus on giving service but we've got some room for improvement. And that's what our team talks about every week and frankly, every day out in the field is where we can drive some efficiency. That's going to be the biggest self help area. It always has been. And that's the work that we've got cut out for us as we go through the last three quarters of this year. I think I've said before that when we look at our direct operating costs, these variable cost, productive labor and ops, supplies and expenses and so forth, even in slower periods in the past, even in 2009, we were able to generate some improvement in those costs as a percent of revenue on a year-over-year basis. And so the operating loss in '09 being with our fixed overhead cost, and so that's the challenge that continues to be in front of us. And in the second quarter, I mentioned, if we can keep those costs at 54%, they were about 53% in the second quarter of last year. So we're going to have a little bit of headwind there but we've got to continue to work those costs down as we progress through the year and that will be the operating challenge that we face.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nBruce Chan: I just want to come at the volume question from a little bit of a different angle. You've had some competitors that were going through some labor negotiations this year. One is going through a pretty significant change of ops. Do you see any volume coming into the network because of -- or maybe in anticipation of those events? And then, Adam, maybe just a quick housekeeping question, you gave us some good color on the fleet age. How long do you think it's going to be before you're back at that sort of target four years?\nAdam Satterfield: I would say that we should make a lot of progress this year. We've got a fair amount of equipment right now that we've got identified that we want to be able to move out of the system, but that takes a fair amount of time to happen. It's not just an overnight thing where you're selling a used car and you posted on a Web site. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to kind of work through that, but we've got a plan. We've met several times recently talking about kind of the needs there and we'll continue to work through it. So I think that we'll make considerable progress this year as we're still bringing on -- we reduced our CapEx for equipment. But we're still going to be bringing on a fair number of new units and more of the progress will be hanging -- or getting rid of some of these older units that we've been hanging on to. And I'll say we're not out of the woods yet when it comes to parts availability and so forth. We're still finding that there are continuing to be supply chain issues out there. And when we've got equipment that has been down for maintenance, equipment has stayed down for longer periods of time. So we're continuing to kind of manage through those challenges while we're also trying to manage cost. But I think we'll end up by the end of this year making pretty steady progress on working that number much lower than where it was at the end of last year, kind of working both ends of the spectrum, if you will.\nBruce Chan: And then just on the volume side, any discernible share wins from any of those union competitors?\nGreg Gantt: It's kind of hard to say, Bruce. We get reports from our national account folks on a regular basis. And we have wins on business from those folks as well as others. So I don't know that you can really point to contract negotiations or whatever the case as any reason that we're getting business. We haven't really seen that.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Greg C. Gantt for any closing remarks.\nGreg Gantt: Well, thanks, everybody, for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. I hope you have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Marty Freeman, our COO; and Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we'll be glad to take your questions. The OD team started this year with first quarter financial results that included revenue of $1.4 billion, an operating ratio of 73.4% and earnings per diluted share of $2.58. These numbers were slightly below our first quarter results from 2022 and reflect the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and the challenging operating environment. We are also coming off a record year in 2022 where revenue and profits were at an all-time high. As we started this year, we were cautiously optimistic that our business levels would start to improve late in the first quarter and accelerate further in the second quarter. While our volumes stabilized during January and February as expected, we have not seen the acceleration in volumes that was originally anticipated. Our shipments per day have remained consistent on a daily basis so far this year, but on a year-over-year basis, shipments in April are trending down double digits. Fortunately, our market share has remained relatively consistent and our yield continues to improve. We believe the stability with our market share during the first quarter reflects the value of our service offering and the success of our long term strategic plan. The guiding principles of this plan have been in place for many years and have helped us produce a strong track record for long term profitable growth throughout the economic cycle. This plan is centered on our ability to deliver superior service at a fair price to our customers, and we remain committed to providing on-time service and claims free service as well. We will continue to focus on delivering a value proposition to our customers while also maintaining a disciplined approach to managing the fundamental aspects of our business. This will include making the best decisions to help us navigate through a challenging environment in the short term while also positioning us for future opportunities to produce long term profitable growth. While we like to measure our success over years, we believe it takes winning on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to add up to long term success. Our consistent focus and successful balance of long term opportunities against short term trends has helped us achieve a 10 year compound average growth rate in revenue and earnings per diluted share of 11.4% and 25%, respectively. I want to close my last earnings call as CEO by saying how incredibly proud I am of the entire OD family of employees, all 23,000 of us, and the track record of success that we have produced together. I am encouraged by the prospects that our team has for future growth. Without any doubt, I stand firm in my belief that OD has the strongest team in the industry, the best service in the industry and is better positioned than any LTL carrier to continue to win market share, while also increasing shareholder value. Thank you for joining us this morning.  And now I will turn things over to Marty for further discussion of the first quarter. I've been through this a few times in my 40 years in transportation. And I think the worst I've ever seen was 2009 and we're nowhere near that. But there is some challenging pricing out there as there always is during low freight levels. Most of it we see is transactional mom-and-pop type shippers and inbound customers. So yes, it can be challenging out there but it's not anything we haven't seen before and it's not anything we can't work through and manage through. I don't mind addressing that at all. I appreciate the question. But fortunately, Tom, we've got a tremendously strong team here at OD. The folks replacing me have merely as many years in some cases in the industry as I do. They are all 20 plus year veterans, they've been through everything since we started executing this plan many years ago. They've been through the thick and thin and the good times, the bad times, and they know who we are and they know what's made us successful. They understand our plan going forward. And I think we're in a great position to continue to execute on that plan. So Tom, there's always risk. Anytime you lose good people, certainly, there's risk. But I feel extremely good about where we are. We'll make the replacement and continue to move forward. Again, thankfully, we had a plan, a plan to execute on my exit, if you will, and promoted the folks that certainly are capable of continuing to drive our results forward. So again, I feel good about it. I'm not concerned about that far at all. These guys know what to do and, hey, I feel extremely good about it. We got a great team. You can see that in the results. It's not me, it's not just the folks here. But I think everybody truly understands what we're trying to do and how we're supposed to execute and handle customers' business on a daily basis, and that's not going to change just because I'm out the door or any other one person left. Those fundamental things that we know how to do much better than our competitors, that's not going to change any time soon. So I think the basics of blocking and tackling those kind of things without any doubt, we're far superior to all of our competitors, again, that's not going to change. So I think we're in a good spot. And hey, I look forward to a whole lot of success down the road for OD. It's maybe a little bit different basket, but not wholly and completely. And just to add a little color to what Adam said, generally speaking with our 3PLs, we're not losing contractual business. Some of those contractual accounts maybe down just because the general economy is slower, they may possibly be down but that's not where we're losing. And the transactional stuff, as Adam talked about before, that's where we're seeing a deterioration in our revenue with those specific 3PLs. They all have a large piece of business that's transactional, that customers may ship once twice whatever a week, smaller type accounts and that's where we're seeing the losses from our standpoint. So it's just business that they can price on the fly. And we're never going to be the low cost guy on the fly, if you will. So anyway, that's more of what we've seen. It's not losing business by any stretch. I'm not sure that with me being on this board and that one... This is not abnormal in this type of environment, economic environment. You have -- some of our competitors, they think offering a more competitive or lower price will keep the customer there. Many times, it does not because the customer will always come back to having their cargo delivered on time and claim free. We've learned that over the years. So it's not abnormal. We choose to tighten our belt and manage our labor. And when the slow times pass, we're in a great position to keep our OR going downwards though. But it's not abnormal to see low prices in any environment with any company. So we've seen it before and it will pass like it always does. And Adam, I'll let you handle the... It's kind of hard to say, Bruce. We get reports from our national account folks on a regular basis. And we have wins on business from those folks as well as others. So I don't know that you can really point to contract negotiations or whatever the case as any reason that we're getting business. We haven't really seen that. Well, thanks, everybody, for your participation today. We appreciate your questions. Feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. I hope you have a great day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue decreased 3.7% in the first quarter of 2023 due to an 11.9% decrease in LTL tonnage that was partially offset by 9.2% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight. The combination of this decrease in revenue and slight deterioration in our operating ratio contributed to the 0.8% decrease in earnings per diluted share to $2.58 for the quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.9% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2022 with the LTL tons per day decreasing 4.3% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 3.4%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 0.6% in revenue per day, a 0.5% decrease in tonnes per day and a 0.2% increase in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in the LTL tonnes per day during the first quarter were as follows. January decreased 1.0% as compared with December, February decreased 0.2% versus January and March increased 0.7% as compared to February. The 10 year average change for the respective months was an increase of 1.2% in January, an increase of 1.7% in February and an increase of 5.2% in March. Our shipments per day over these same periods were relatively consistent on a sequential basis and increased slightly each month as we progressed through the first quarter. While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has decreased by approximately 15% when compared to April of 2022. Our LTL tonnage per day has also decreased by approximately 15%, while revenue per hundredweight has increased approximately 1% when including fuel surcharges and increased approximately 7.5% excluding fuel surcharges. Our revenue and shipment counts on a daily basis have been relatively consistent in April when compared to March of this year, except for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. As previously mentioned, however, we had expected to see acceleration in business levels by this point in the year based on customer feedback and our historical planning process. While we would like to see our market share continue to increase again, we believe that it's more important to maintain our price discipline during this period of economic weakness, while positioning ourselves to emerge from a slow period with capacity and a better opportunity to produce strong profitable growth over the long term. We have operated in scenarios like this before and we will continue to execute our plan and adjust to this lower than expected volume environment until an inflection point happens and we can shift back into growth mode again. Our first quarter operating ratio increased to 73.4% for the first quarter as the improvements in our direct operating costs did not sufficiently offset the increase in overhead cost as a percent of revenue. Many of our fixed cost categories increased as a percent of revenue during the quarter due to the deleveraging effect associated with the decrease in revenue as well as the timing and significance of certain expenditures. In particular, our depreciation and amortization costs increased 80 basis points and general supplies and expenses increased 30 basis points. Within our direct operating costs, our purchase transportation cost as a percent of revenue improved 140 basis points, while our productive labor cost improved 50 basis points. These changes more than offset the 50 basis point increase in operating supplies and expenses that was primarily due to an increase in our maintenance and repair costs. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $415.4 million for the first quarter and capital expenditures were $234.7 million. We currently anticipate our capital expenditures will be approximately $700 million this year, which is a $100 million decrease from our initial capital expenditure plan. We plan to continue with real estate expansion projects that are already in process and others that we believe will be critical to our long term operating plan. We also plan to continue to purchase new equipment, which we believe will help lower the average age of our fleet and help reduce our maintenance cost per mile. We utilized $141.7 million of cash for our share repurchase program and paid $44.1 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our effective tax rate was 25.8% and 26% for the first quarter of 2023 and 2022 respectively. We currently expect our annual effective tax rate to be 25.6% for the second quarter of 2023. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator, we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Certainly, it's been difficult to read the tea leaves this year, and we felt like we've had a lot of good conversations with customers and continue to have them. But certainly, it seemed like the whole banking issue was a bit of cold water on the economy overall. I think that it just continues to be a challenging overall and people question in some cases the direction of the economy and continue to be somewhat conservative as a result. But I think our business, we obviously have been talking about probably since the third quarter of last year, an expectation that we would start seeing an uptick, and it didn't happen. Things have stabilized, we continue to be consistent. We continue to have good conversations though. And I would say within our direct business, having conversations with customers, we're seeing an increase in some of these accounts. When I look through our top 50 accounts, business that's not with the 3PL, we're seeing a good increase. We actually saw an increase in revenue with those accounts during the first quarter. Some of our business with 3PLs is suffering a little more. Like we said in our prepared comments, we're seeing some shippers that are prioritizing price over service right now, but you've got a lot of others. And I think that's why we're seeing the increase in our direct business that continue to think strategically about their supply chain, understand the value that we're delivering and know that this environment will turn again. And we helped many of these customers through challenging times and the pandemic and then the supply chain crisis that followed. So I think it's a mixed bag across the board but we continue to stay engaged, we're continuing to have favorable conversations. And it's just a matter of when the economy eventually recovers and we're certainly prepared for when that happens. It's just day in and day out. Our shipments per day have just been pretty consistent, pretty much all through the first quarter, and that's continuing into April. Certainly, the fuel surcharge, this is the quarter we talked about. It actually happened in March. In March, the average price per gallon was down about 18%. Right now with fuel being $4.10 somewhere in that range, fuel prices are down about 25%. So certainly, we'll see a bigger decrease on a year-over-year basis of fuel surcharges. That's end of the April number that we put out. Already, fuel in April is down about 20%. And so that's driving some of that 15% decrease that we're seeing in our April revenues on a year-over-year basis. But I think the impact is evident in our yield metrics. We're continuing to see good yield increases. As we're going through bids and whatnot, we're continuing to talk about our cost plus increases that are necessary. But when we look at April and kind of where things are, the revenue per hundredweight continues to be solid. And we would expect to see sequential increase in the second quarter over the first quarter. That number should naturally start to trend back closer to what our longer term averages have been from just a core yield increase standpoint, but the revenue per hundredweight with the fuel is reflecting that change now in fuel prices and the fuel surcharge. So that is starting to flatten out, if you will, just like the numbers that we talked about for what we've seen month-to-date for April. This is certainly -- it's definitely not a usual type of quarter, as you said. I mean, with tonnage being down about 15%, it's been since '09, since we've seen that type of change or maybe back to the second quarter of '20 when the pandemic happened and the world shutdown. But it's something that we've been consistently adjusting to. And frankly, we knew the second quarter comparisons were going to be more challenging this year when we looked through the balance of how the quarters would fall. But the buildup in March that we anticipated obviously didn't happen, that's where you start really getting a lot of that growth, really it happened throughout the first quarter. But March is typically a pretty good increase when you look at things on a shipments per day standpoint that should be up 5% or so. Right now, like I mentioned before, we're seeing shipments per day that's just pretty steady on a day in and day out basis coming in at somewhere around 47,000 shipments per day. And granted the April will have the impact, we don't do half day conventions, but we pretty much have about a half a day loss with the Good Friday and the Easter holidays. But if we don't come off of that number -- and I'll tell you, it's not like we're picking up the same 47,000 shipments day in and day out, we're getting increases with some accounts while others were seeing decreases with. It's not as easy as maybe as what that sounds as it's consistent day in and day out. But if we don't see any further growth from there, we should see it in May, just the natural effect of just like the impact of the holidays, recovering from that, a little bit of growth and if we can move forward from there. But overall, for the quarter, if we're still in this environment where there's no sequential increase then we're looking at revenues that might be flattish in the second quarter with the first as compared to we're normally up about 10% on a per day basis. So if that's the scenario that we're in then I think that we're looking at an operating ratio that may be more consistent with the first quarter and could see some slight deterioration from there. I think our challenge will continue to be managing our direct variable cost, that's a productive labor, our operating supplies and expenses and so forth. If we're in the same type of shipments per day environment, managing those costs flat, maybe with some slight improvement as a percent of revenue, those were about 54% of revenue in the first quarter. And then from an overhead standpoint, those costs were about 19.5% in the first quarter. We'll continue to have an increase in the aggregate amount of depreciation expenses and some other dollars of overhead that might increase. So those costs could increase further as a percent of revenue from that 19.5%. But for us, it's certainly challenging. But I can tell you our teams were looking at costs, were looking at productivity, were looking at the size of the fleet and making adjustments on a day by day basis trying to get in and save costs where we can. But like we mentioned before, doing all the right things that position us to come out of this downturn even stronger. And that's when the inflection when it happens when we really outperform for the longest time when we get into these slower macro periods, our market share is generally flatter as we maintain our price discipline. But then when we come out, that's when we really see the outperformance in our volumes versus the industry. So we're going to continue to -- with the same strategic plan that's got us to where we are today and I think that we'll emerge from this thing even stronger. Well, assuming a little bit just the natural uptick that would happen in the sense of our May volumes should be somewhere -- I mean, where we are today, if they stay at this 47,000 range, it'd be a slight uptick over April just because of April being impacted by that half day that I mentioned for the Good Friday and Easter holidays. But you're correct. Just assuming that we stay in this sort of malaise where we don't see any incremental uptick and frankly, no decline either, but just staying in this flattish on a sequential basis, we certainly hope that there will be an uptick in volumes. We've seen some good trends, good couple of days this week. But I think that we certainly need to be mindful of kind of where we are and the fact that we don't see that positive inflection from an economic standpoint happening. And so I think we do need to talk about kind of where we are today. Obviously, we give our mid-quarter update. So if the inflection happens and we start seeing some growth, we're certainly ready and can handle it. And that's when we can start maybe talking about seeing some incremental improvement, if you will, relative to the first quarter. But right now, it's just things on a day in, day out basis are -- have just been very steady as she goes from a revenue per day and a shipments per day standpoint. Yes, I mean it's certainly -- one, I think the comparison is a little bit tougher and that should get better as we progress through this year, even if our numbers were to stay flatter, the numbers should start to show a little bit of improvement. But it's still a really soft environment out there. And I think that we've demonstrated a lot of value and that's what we continue to talk about with our customers. And our costs continue to go up and we need increases. We've invested a lot in our network over the years, over the last 10 years, about $4.5 billion of capital expenditures to grow our service center network, to be and have capacity where our customers need us and to have the right fleet and the right team to be able to continue to deliver value to our customers. So we've invested a lot and we intend to continue to invest. So I think that, that doesn't change the conversations that we're having with shippers. But in some cases due to the economy and due to internal pressures, there are some shippers that got to look for cheaper price carriers. And we're a premium carrier, premium service and our price is generally a little bit higher than others. And so oftentimes we'll hear feedback though from shippers that are making that short term decision that they're doing it to meet internal thresholds and intend to give the volume back to us. Like I mentioned, we're seeing a little bit more transactional volume loss within our 3PL book of business right now, that's about a third of our overall revenue in the first quarter. 3PLs were down a little worse than the company average revenue change. So that's something that would continue to be mindful of. And that too often flips and kind of ebbs and flows with the economy. But I think for us, it's just got have a plan, and we have one and stay disciplined to it and just keep our focus on delivering service. That comes at a cost. There becomes a fixed element of running our linehaul network and our P&D system to be able to continue to deliver service. And usually, this is when service breakdown occurs in the industry. When you become very focused on mitigating cost and I think we're in a much stronger position than every other carrier. But when you start focusing on trying to mitigate cost in this type of environment when the other carriers have seen worse volume loss than us on average, that's when trailers start getting hailed longer to try to fill them up and on-time service starts declining, claims start increasing, other bad things happen, that really, I think, or at least what we've seen in the past, we see a widening of the gap from a service performance on us versus the industry. So we expect that will play out again. And when the economy starts recovering, it's obviously tough to manage through it on a day-by-day basis. But I think we get right back to our market share gains. I don't think anything has changed in the sense of what we think our long term market share potential can be, what our long term operating ratio goals are. None of that really changes. It just kind of news when the start point begins when we get back into market share growth mode again. It was pretty consistent performance between our retail and industrial customer base during the quarter. The revenue levels were generally about the same for both. But like I mentioned earlier, it's really a lot of the business that we're seeing, there's probably a little bit worse decline with business that's managed by 3PLs. And so that's fairly typical in a softer environment, if you will, and so not wholly unexpected completely. But yes, we've seen just a consistency day in and day out with business levels in terms of the number of shipments per day that we've seen, it's been trending around 47,000 bills a day and we don't necessarily see that inflection point, if you will, happening. Typically, you would start seeing an increase, you'd see an increase in May of about 2.5% to 3% and then a further increase from May to June of 2%. And certainly, we'd like to think that that might happen. But if you go back to when things really started decreasing, it was last year in April. March of last year was the last month where we had a nice sequential increase. Our business in February of last year was up about 5%. It was up another 3% in March. But then we started dropping off and basically have been flat to down for every month thereafter. And our shipments have been pretty consistent, they've increased very, very slightly, less than 1% each month. So pretty much consistent as we made our way through each month of the first quarter, pretty much had been the same in April, again, other than those two days that we consider full days impacted by the holiday, but that's in our normal number. Typically, April would be up about 0.5% over March. And right now, we're down about 2.5% shipments per day. So that's some of that where we've just seen that consistent trend day in and day out. So do we start seeing some increase? Like I mentioned before, May just naturally should show a little bit of growth if we stay at this 47,000 bill level. And do we start growing from there? Do we see 1% or growth in June? I'd like to think that we would. And again, we've had a lot of good conversations. We've had some good hits here lately with customers. But some of those same conversations we were having three months ago where we were positive as well. So I think that right now, we just want to be conservative, if you will, and we're continuing to try to manage our costs down to this lower level of shipments. And I think that will continue to happen as we progress through the years. We focus on productivity. We're a little heavy with our fleet now as well and we're working through some of those challenges. But just trying to get everything balanced as best as we can while we stay in this sort of stable period, if you will. But it's just not really seeing any kind of growth. But I'd say typically, April volumes from a shipments per day standpoint typically are fairly consistent with what our year-to-date average is, and we've seen that over time other than in 2020. And so that's something that we just sort of keep in mind from a planning standpoint. And we always have a plan for -- we have a baseline plan, we've talked about this before that we enter every year with and then we have a bull scenario and a bear scenario. And '21 was more at that bull case scenario and this year is more in the bear. So we start with a plan, if things materialize like this, and that's about at the level where we are and we're executing on that plan. From a second quarter to first quarter standpoint, other than the second quarter of '20 when the world shutdown, we've not really seen a decrease in shipments. And that too kind of played into our general thinking, even years like 2009, 2016, 2019, weaker years, we still had some marginal improvement in shipments in the second quarter versus the first. And so right now, that's kind of trending flattish. We'll see how things shake out for the remainder of the period. And like I said, maybe we'll get some growth. And certainly, it will be out there as we put our mid quarter update, we'll put the final April update in our 10-Q. And if we see some continued acceleration this week that will be in the number, but we just don't see a big inflection point happening like we did in, say, 2017 that spurred that growth of '17 through '18 and what we saw in the back part of 2020 that continue to accelerate through '21 like it happened. And so we're still waiting for that point but we don't see it kind of on the near term. And so we just managed to kind of where we are. But yes, that's kind of the challenge in what we're seeing. It's partly why I mentioned earlier that our revenues in the second quarter are typically up 9%, 10% and that's why we always get so much margin improvement in the second quarter as well. And so that becomes the challenge as we manage through this particular period. But with respect to your other question on the customer base, I don't know that we're seeing significant loss other than that's some of what's going on underneath, I think, with some of the 3PL business, that they can leverage their carrier relationships and move some freight, and some of this is transactional as well. But they can take advantage of relationships and see who has capacity and who's got a cheaper price and move some business away. But that's some of the feedback where we've heard customers coming to us and saying, look, I need to do this to meet my own call center objectives, if there's an internal mandate to save X dollars that they've got to try to meet in some way. But generally speaking, that freight comes back to us. If we ever lose freight, it's on price, but we generally always gain it back for service quality and capacity down the road. So we're confident that -- but that trend will continue to play out again and that we'll see any of this freight loss eventually come back to us. It's just a matter of -- it seems like that's being pushed further down the road than the inflection point that we thought would happen beginning with this spring. Yes, weight per shipment. I guess you've embedded three questions in one, but -- and my memory was short. Yes, our weight per shipment, it's down a little bit further. I think we're getting to the stabilization point. Right now in April, it's about 1,525 pounds. Historically, we would get down in lower periods to about 1,550 pounds or so. But if you recall, we made some strategic decisions in '21 and exited from some of the spot heavier type shipments, these 8,000, 10,000 pound type loads and that had an effect of really lowering our overall weight per shipment. So despite the weakness, we're not going back and trying to bring in freight that we didn't think fit our network for the long term. So just going along with the economy, we've seen a little further deceleration and that weight per shipment being down to 1,525 pounds. So that's a little bit worse. April is always usually down 0.5% or 1% off of March. Some of that is March builds up at the end of the quarter, but we're down a little bit more. But I feel like that's stabilizing that probably our low watermark in a softer economy will be 1,525, 1,530 pounds maybe. But yes, we think that's getting to a stabilization point or so it seems. Yes, it's continued to drift lower on a sequential basis. The average was down about 3.5% in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. But our peak, if you will, for full time headcount was in May of last year. And through normal attrition and just some places making other decisions, if you will, just balancing our number of employees with the freight volumes that exist, we've had to work through those on a case-by-case basis throughout our 255 locations. But I expect that, that will continue to drift a little bit lower as attrition continues to happen from where we are today through the end of June. And we're getting to a point, I think, that if you kind of compare where we are, if we continue to drift maybe 1% or 2% lower as we progress through the second quarter to where the year-over-year change by the end of June maybe in that 9% to 10% type of range, and then that's coming back into balance. We've always talked about the change in headcount typically reconciles with the overall change in shipment count as well. And so you know if we're looking at that, I think by the end of June, that change in shipments on a month-over-month basis, those two numbers may start coming back into payer team with one another. That is the change in full time employees and the change in our shipments on a year-over-year basis. Yes, I think it's hard for us to say. We don't always know the reasons behind. I mean the feedback we get is that someone's cheaper. We don't know necessarily that variance or that reason why. I think that we're obviously one of the first carriers to report and just continue to watch what the others are doing, what their numbers are looking like and hear what the others have to say, I think. Others have said that they've got price discipline but we've seen one carrier's yield flatten out. So I think all we can do is just continue to sort of watch and and see what others are doing, but that doesn't impact what we do. We've got a plan, we stay committed to it, and we know what value we deliver and we just got to stay disciplined, and that's what we'll do. So it's never good to kind of live through it in a moment and we've done this time and time again. But like I said, it's not totally unexpected to see some of that business just given the softness in the economic environment and cost challenges that people are facing in general to be looking at ways they might be able to save on price in the current term. But what we always say is price doesn't equal cost. We deliver value to our customers. And when you consider total cost of transportation, when you deliver 99% on time and have a claims ratio of 0.1% and you save money by shipping with Old Dominion and that's what our position continues to be, demonstrate value. We've got to continue to maintain our service metrics, and we will, that is certainly a focus for us, and we'll manage through this. But like we said before and I think it's played out when you look at our numbers and the long term improvement that we've made with respect to our margins and the cash from operations that we generate and are able to reinvest back in our business on behalf of our customers, we've got to maintain our disciplined approach. And I think that it's proven itself out in the long run and is a key difference why our numbers look a lot different from some of the others. No I wouldn't say it... I would only say on the call standpoint, I mean, obviously, we've switched to where our variable costs or the majority of our cost base now, probably 70% or more of our costs now are variable in nature. And obviously, we've got a big fixed cost base and we're seeing the loss leverage with the revenue decline there driving some of that. But some of the increase in those overhead costs in the first quarter also comes from the fact that we're on a little bit of a different schedule with respect to our equipment plan. We were taking delivery in the fourth quarter of equipment, taken delivery in the first quarter, which is unusual and that was part of why we had anticipated a sequential increase in those depreciation costs as a percent of revenue. But given all the challenges from a fleet standpoint, that's driving some of our costs. It's also driving some of the maintenance and repair costs, like I mentioned. We're seeing an increase in cost per mile. Some of that is just due to general inflation related to parts and repairs. But some of it, too, just relates to the fact that we're bringing in equipment. We've -- on a different schedule, we've held equipment through '21 and '22 and our average fleet age has increased as a result. We're -- probably our average fleet age is about five and half years now, we like it to be around four years. And so we'll work on balancing that as we take out some of the older equipment from the fleet and adjusting our fleet, if you will, to the lower shipment levels and that will help from a cost and an efficiency standpoint. But 80% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits and ops supplies and expenses. And linehaul is a big element underneath that. And so that's why we've got to stay disciplined. We mentioned in our prepared comments about our linehaul load factor being down like it is. I can tell you that's a focus, that's a lot of dollars, not only from a labor standpoint, but that's what creates the miles that we run. And so that's -- we can drive some improvement there, that will help us from both labor and fuel, in particular, while we're also making some adjustments on the fleet that will help with both depreciation and maintenance costs. But like I think I said earlier, there's an element that becomes fixed -- about every variable cost is fixed in the short run. And if we want to continue to deliver service and we are, there becomes a fixed element within that linehaul component. And so we've got to be able to do both, frankly. We're not going to lose our focus on giving service but we've got some room for improvement. And that's what our team talks about every week and frankly, every day out in the field is where we can drive some efficiency. That's going to be the biggest self help area. It always has been. And that's the work that we've got cut out for us as we go through the last three quarters of this year. I think I've said before that when we look at our direct operating costs, these variable cost, productive labor and ops, supplies and expenses and so forth, even in slower periods in the past, even in 2009, we were able to generate some improvement in those costs as a percent of revenue on a year-over-year basis. And so the operating loss in '09 being with our fixed overhead cost, and so that's the challenge that continues to be in front of us. And in the second quarter, I mentioned, if we can keep those costs at 54%, they were about 53% in the second quarter of last year. So we're going to have a little bit of headwind there but we've got to continue to work those costs down as we progress through the year and that will be the operating challenge that we face. I would say that we should make a lot of progress this year. We've got a fair amount of equipment right now that we've got identified that we want to be able to move out of the system, but that takes a fair amount of time to happen. It's not just an overnight thing where you're selling a used car and you posted on a Web site. So it's going to take us a little bit of time to kind of work through that, but we've got a plan. We've met several times recently talking about kind of the needs there and we'll continue to work through it. So I think that we'll make considerable progress this year as we're still bringing on -- we reduced our CapEx for equipment. But we're still going to be bringing on a fair number of new units and more of the progress will be hanging -- or getting rid of some of these older units that we've been hanging on to. And I'll say we're not out of the woods yet when it comes to parts availability and so forth. We're still finding that there are continuing to be supply chain issues out there. And when we've got equipment that has been down for maintenance, equipment has stayed down for longer periods of time. So we're continuing to kind of manage through those challenges while we're also trying to manage cost. But I think we'll end up by the end of this year making pretty steady progress on working that number much lower than where it was at the end of last year, kind of working both ends of the spectrum, if you will."

            "name": "Marty Freeman",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg, and good morning. I want to, first of all, start by thanking Greg for his leadership and significant contributions to OD over his career, while also recognizing each OD employee for their critical role in our success. Together, we have produced remarkable improvement in our financial and operating results over the long term. And I can assure you that OD's team remains focused on continuing our record of strong profitable growth. With respect to our first quarter, we delivered solid financial results, especially when considering the ongoing softness in the domestic economy and decrease in volumes. Although these factors contributed to the first decrease in quarterly revenue and earnings per diluted share since the second quarter of 2020, our market share has remained relatively consistent. As a result, we believe our decrease in volumes was largely due to some shippers simply having fewer shipments than normal due to the economy. Although there have been others that are beginning to emphasize price versus service and choosing lower priced carriers. The operating environment has become more challenging than we anticipated and the expected acceleration in volumes has obviously not occurred. Despite these factors, we have maintained a commitment to our long term strategic plan. We will continue to focus on providing shippers with superior service to support our ability to maintain our price discipline. Our consistent cost based approach to manage yield and account profitability has been critical to our ability to improve our financial position over time, which has helped us support and continued investments in technology and service center capacity. While capacity is not currently an industry issue due to the weakness in industry volumes, we believe this will once again become a critical differentiator for us when the economy improves. We believe our long term consistent investment in service center capacity has been and remains a strategic advantage that supports our long term market share goals. During this period of revenue decline, we will also maintain a disciplined approach to managing our variable cost and discretionary spending to protect our profitability. This starts with a commitment to maximizing the operating efficiency of our fleet and network. Some of our productivity measurements in the first quarter were negatively impacted by the general loss of operating density associated with the decrease in our shipments and weight per shipment. This was evidenced by a 4.9% decrease in our linehaul latent load average and a 1% decrease in our P&D shipments per hour. We improved our platform productivity, however, and generated a 5.8% increase in our platform shipments per hour. We also reduced our reliance on purchase transportation as compared to the first quarter of 2022, which allowed us to improve the overall efficiency of our operations. This contributed to the improvement in our variable cost as a percent of revenue during the first quarter. We will also continue to work on improving the efficiency of our operations as we make our way through the balance of this year, which provides an opportunity to generate additional cost savings. While productivity is always a focus, we cannot and we will not allow it to impact our best-in-class service performance. Our team continued to deliver superior service during the first quarter with an on-time service of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. This service performance remains critical to support our yield management strategies. We have said many times before that to produce long term improvement in our operating ratio will continue to require a balance between operating density and yield management, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. As just mentioned, we lost operating density in the quarter in the current environment due to the decline in volumes and the expansion of our network. Our yield has continued to consistently improve, however, and revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, increased 8.6% during the first quarter. We will continue to demonstrate value to our customers by balancing our superior service offering with a consistent cost based approach to our pricing. The resulting value proposition is unmatched in the LTL industry and will continue to support our ability to increase market share over the long term. As we look forward to remaining quarters of this year, we currently anticipate the softer demand environment will continue. The second quarter is generally the period when volumes begin to accelerate, but we have yet to see an inflection towards growth. Nevertheless, I want to emphasize that we are well positioned to respond to any acceleration in volumes that might occur if and when the economy improves. Until that time comes, we will continue to focus on managing our costs and delivering value to our customers through our value proposition of on-time claims free service at a fair price. Delivering value is a central element of our long term strategic plan and we remain committed to execute on this plan regardless of the economic cycle. As a critical part of this plan, we will also continue to execute our capital expenditure program and most importantly, invest in the training, education and development of our OD family of employees. The economy will eventually recover and we are confident that when it does, our team's execution will allow us to achieve further growth and profitability while also increasing our shareholder value. Thanks for joining us today. Adam will now discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jack Atkins, Director of Finance Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJack Atkins: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the third quarter 2024 conference call for Old Dominion Freight Line. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today and through October 30, 2024, by dialing 1 (877) 344-7529, access code 4016991.

As a final note, before we begin, we welcome your questions today, but ask that you limit yourself to just one question at a time before returning to the queue. At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Marty Freeman, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Marty, please go ahead, sir.\nKevin Freeman: Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am joining the call today from a separate location, therefore, please bear with us when we are taking questions if there are any connectivity issues. Old Dominion's financial results in the third quarter reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. Our revenue and earnings per diluted share both declined on a year-over-year basis during the quarter, although our market share and volume trends remained relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While the operating environment continued to be challenging. Our team did a good job of managing our variable cost and we also continue to control our discretionary spending. The deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue, however, caused many of our cost categories to increase as a percent of revenue. This was the primary driver for the increase in our operating ratio to a 72.7 in the third quarter. We have been pleased with the consistency in our market share this year, which is consistent with our historical experience doing slower parts of the economic cycle. We continue to have strong customer retention trends and we are also winning new business. Our customers simply have had fewer shipments that they contender to us and our average weight per shipment has also remained at historical lows. The stability of our market share continues to be supported by the quality of our service and overall value that we offer to our customers. These are a few of the foundational elements of our long-term strategic plan. The OD family of employees continued to execute on these core principles during the third quarter as our own time service was 99% and our cargo claims ratio was a 0.1%. While we are incredibly proud of these service statistics, we would also like to remind you that superior service means much more than simply picking up and delivering our customers freight on time and claims free. There are plenty of other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier, such as carriers' trustworthiness, ease of doing business, and the quality and responsiveness of customer service representatives. In fact, Mastio & Company measured 28 different service and value related attributes as part of its recent annual survey of shipper and logistic professionals. Mastio published the results of his 2024 study last week and we were honored to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 15 consecutive year. OD finished number one in 23 of the 28 evaluated categories measured by Mastio and maintained a sizable lead against our competition when it comes to the overall quality of service. I would like to congratulate the entire OD family of employees on this remarkable achievement and I would also like to thank this outstanding team for their commitment to our company and our customers. We continue to believe that consistency and quality of our service over the long-term has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and driven our long-term profitable growth. While becoming the best carrier in the business was hard. Remaining the best carrier for 15 straight years is an incredible accomplishment and that is hard to put in perspective. Every member of the OD team has played a part in our success and I can assure you that each of us is incredibly motivated to keep delivering our promises to provide our customers with the highest standard of service. By continuing to provide best in class service to our customers day-after-day and year-after-year, we are also able to maintain our long-term and disciplined approach to pricing. We continue to focus on consistently improving our yields to sufficiently offset our cost inflation and support additional investments in capacity and technology. These ongoing investments have created incremental value for our customers in many ways, which has further enhanced our industry leading value proposition. Our customers have recognized our value proposition over time, which has allowed us to be able to earn more and more of their business. As a result, we have won more market share over the past 10 years than any carrier in our industry. While the economic environment has remained sluggish for much longer than we ever anticipated, we believe we are better positioned than ever to respond to the eventual inflection in demand that will occur as the economy improves. We have the capacity, the fleet and most importantly, the committed team of people to take advantage of an improving economic environment. Our unique company culture and each employee's commitment to excellence gives me tremendous confidence that we can also be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years. This confidence is bolstered by the results of the most recent Mastio study as well as the ongoing conversations we have with our customers. By staying focused on long-term opportunities for additional profitable growth, we remain confident in our ability to create additional value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter in greater detail.\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue totaled $1.47 billion for the third quarter 2024, which was a 3.0% decrease from the prior year. We had one extra workday in the third quarter of this year, so the decrease on a per day basis was 4.5%. These revenue results reflect the 4.8% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by the 1.5% increase in LTL revenue per hundred way. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 1.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2024. With LTL tons per day decreasing 3.2% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 1.0%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.9% in LTL tons per day, and an increase of 2.3% in LTL shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows. July decreased 4.4% as compared to June, August decreased 0.8% as compared to July and September increased 1.7% as compared to August. The 10 year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 2.9% in July, an increase of 0.6% in August, and an increase of 3.5% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will decrease by approximately 11.2% to 11.8% when compared to October 2023, with a decrease of approximately 9.2% to 9.8% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio increased 210 basis points to 72.7% for the third quarter of 2024. As Marty mentioned, the decrease in our revenue had a deleveraging effect on many of our operating expenses during the quarter. This contributed to the 110 basis point increase in our overhead cost as a percent of revenue. In addition, and for the first time this year, our direct operating cost also increased as a percent of revenue when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in cost associated with our group health and dental plans. As a result, our employee benefit cost increased to 38.6% of salaries and wages during the third quarter of 2024 from 37.3% in the same period of the prior year. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $446.5 million for the third quarter and $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $242.8 million and $600.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $187.7 million and $824.8 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while our cash dividends totaled $55.6 million and $168.2 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter, 2024 was 23.4% as compared to 24.08% in the third quarter of 2023. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 24.5% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Eric Morgan of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess I just wanted to start on the near-term. sounds like October tonnage decline is getting a little bit worse relative to September. Is that being driven by, shipment weights coming lower? Kind of has been the trend here recently. And then, how are you thinking about operating ratio into year-end here? That'd be helpful, thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. From a volume standpoint, the year-over-year our tonnage is in October. Take the midpoint of that range that we gave would be down about nine and a half percent. And obviously we've got many days left to finish out this month and so we'll see how the rest of the month finish is why we gave a little bit more of a range than we normally do. But if you take the midpoint of that in October, that's got our sequential change down. Just call it about 3.5%. The 10-year average sequential is a decrease of 3.1% and that's October versus September. So, it's actually encouraging to see what our volume trends so far this month have been. This is the first time that we've been, I would say relatively close to what our normal sequential changes have been in the first month of the quarter. So, we feel pretty good about how volumes are trending and continued strength in our yield performance that we've seen as well. So, we'll continue to watch that. But the year-over-year I think is just skewed a bit by, if you recall last year, we had a competitor that had a cybersecurity issue and we had some temporary freight coming into the system, if you will. So, we picked up some incremental freight there that was a bit unusual and caused outperformance from a seasonality standpoint that obviously is not there right now. But feeling good thus far about the October trend.\nEric Morgan: Thanks. And just the operating ratio side of that, if you wouldn't mind. Appreciate it.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I was going to try to leave that maybe for someone else. Those are two big questions packed into one. So just try to keep questions to one. But just to go ahead and address that because we know it's going to be a question anyways. The normal 3Q to 4Q regression is about a 200 to 250 basis point deterioration, and that's excluding any insurance adjustments. We do an actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter every year. Sometimes those are good guys. Sometimes like last year, I think we had about a 70 basis point headwind when it came to the actuarial adjustment. It was an unfavorable adjustment last year. So, I think when thinking about this fourth quarter, conservatively, I think we probably ought to slide that scale up about 100 basis points. And the reason for that would just be the continued risk from a revenue standpoint and the impact that would have on overhead expenses. We just saw that headwind play out in the third quarter kind of going back to the guidance that we gave at the end of the second quarter call, going into 2Q. Revenue came in softer and as a result our overhead expenses were about 40 basis points higher than kind of what we had anticipated at the end of the second quarter call. And then I think we also have a continued risk with respect to our fringe benefit costs. Those were higher than what the trend has been this year and higher than what they had been for the same period last year in the third quarter. And so, I think there's a continued risk those may stay a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. But both of those things are something that could trend better. I think if we have like I mentioned earlier, the October trend is starting out pretty good from a volume standpoint. So, if we can get our revenues back closer to seasonality, if you will, and obviously we'll give our mid quarter updates, then there can be some favorability there, but just some pluses and minuses. And I think from a conservative standpoint, probably better to just slide that scale up in terms of where things stand right now.\nEric Morgan: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Yeah, thank you, Robert. Hey, gentlemen, good morning. Appreciate the time. You brought up Estes issues that they had last year that sort of grow sort of beyond normal tonnage numbers for you in October of '23. Should we expect then that by November and December the tonnage comps get easier so we're not probably really looking at sort of down as much as we're seeing in October?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I think that's fair. I think the October, is definitely the toughest comp when I go back and look at last year's sequential performance in November versus October, our tonnage was down six tenths of a percent. And our 10-year average there is a 3.1% increase. And then December outperformed. We were down 4.8% in December of '23 versus November of '23. The 10-year average there is 7%. So, I think that this is probably the toughest comp, if you will, of the quarter in October. But depending on how November trends, if we get some acceleration back in the business. And then obviously December is always a tough month for everyone given the holidays and whatnot. But if we can kind of hang on, we had a little bit of outperformance there. So December will be a little bit tougher versus the November. But I think on the whole, as we go through this fourth quarter, this feels like we're finally getting to what we hope is a floor. We're encouraged about how things are trending. It's good to see the sequential performance thus far in October and obviously it got many days to get through this quarter. And 1Q is also tough to think about from a big picture standpoint. We've been underperforming normal sequential trends for about two and a half years now. So, it certainly feels like we're finally coming to the end of a cycle. We've got to go through these tough quarters, but we finally have seen, I think traction with respect to interest rates are declining. We'll have the uncertainty of the election behind us pretty soon. And so hopefully we get back to seeing some growth for our industry for which typically when the industry starts to inflect to the positive, that's when our model shines the brightest and we win the most share. So, we're looking forward to getting through this final quarter here of the year and starting out next year with hopefully some good strength.\nJason Seidl: No, I hope so too out of it. And with the year-over-year comp in October for Estes, did that impact the weight per shipment at all? Could you remind us?\nAdam Satterfield: The weight per shipment last year? It was pretty much right in line with what our normal tenure average would be. So we were, in October last year we were down three tenths of a percent and then pretty much performed about in alignment with what normal weight per shipment would trend. Typically, you'll get a little bit of an increase in weight for shipment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And that's something that actually was a little bit of a surprise for us in the third quarter our weight for shipment ticked down a bit. And July was somewhat consistent. And I'm speaking of this year now, July was pretty consistent, consistent with our 10-year average. But then it dropped further in August, came back a little bit in September. But overall kind of underperformed what the weight would be. But at this point we've actually in October seeing a bit of an increase. So, typically the 10-year average in October, like I just said, is down three tenth. So, if we're seeing a little bit of an increase, that's obviously a good thing for business as well. We're getting more weight per shipment, going to have a little bit higher revenue per shipment as well. And that generally drives improved productivity also. And hopefully that generally has been a sign of hope with respect to the economy as well. So that would be another metric to continue to watch to see if we see things start to pick up for us.\nJason Seidl: Right. Well, listen, I really appreciate the time and color guys.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. I want to follow up maybe on the near-term trend. So, it seems like LTL yield growth has moderated a bit across the industry. I appreciate the tonnage update for October, I guess. Adam, could you share some color on how you see yields shaping up here into the fourth quarter and then more broadly, if the macro remains this week, I guess do you expect to see any irrationality in the market that would make it harder for you guys to keep realizing price increases above inflation or how is your price realization going as you talk to customers? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I was pleased with our yield performance through the third quarter. And it takes having superior service to support what we're able to achieve consistently year in and year out from a yield performance. And so, we're really, really proud of the service metrics we've been able to deliver. And just to repeat, winning that Mastio award for the 15 straight years, hopefully has put to bed some of the faults that that gap between us and our competitors has closed and so really pleased to see that performance with this year's results. But I think at the end of the last call we talked about normal seasonality with respect to our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. And that would have put us in the 4% to 4.5% range for the third quarter. And we came in at the top end of that range and granted we had a little bit lower weight per shipment as just was referencing with Jason. But so that certainly helped the revenue per hundredweight. But to me it just seemed like consistent performance through the quarter and that's what we would continue to expect. Our yield management process is we take a long-term and consistent approach that tries to offset our cost inflation and support continued investments in our network and in our technologies and so forth. So, if normal seasonality plays out for the fourth quarter, that would put that revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel, up in the 3.8% to 4.2% type of range. And we'll continue to watch that as we go through, but we expect to continue to get increases. We're seeing it, we've seen it throughout this year and really throughout the last two and a half years that we've been in this weak economic period and so just continue to execute on that consistent philosophy and we're getting increases as we go through bid renewals and that would be the same expectation as we go through this year and would be the same as we go through next year as well.\nDaniel Imbro: Appreciate all the color. Best of luck, guys.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. I just want to follow up on that last question. So, I think, Adam, your October update is that total yields were negative and I guess you're talking about yield ex-fuel up, call it 4%. So, this drop off in yield is entirely fuel. I know fuel is down, but I just want to make sure that that's right. And then just to ask it sort of directly, like are you seeing more pricing competition, irrational pricing? There's certainly more concern about that in the market right now. Are you guys seeing it or not?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. Just to address, October and we didn't give the exact number, but you can kind of back into it. the revenue per hundredweight with fuel, right now is trending down, but a lot of that is fuel related. Fuel at this point is down about 20% compared to October of last year. So, a bigger drop, if you will, compared to what we just saw in the third quarter and that should moderate as we progress through the fourth quarter. It was about $4.50 a gallon last year in October, but ended up averaging about $4.25 for the full fourth quarter of last year. So that's something that will moderate a bit and anytime looking at one-month trends as well, given some of that disruption that we had last year, you had some mix issues going on and so forth. So, we would still expect to see that sequential trend play out like I just mentioned, and overall yields ex fuel being up in that 3.8% to 4.2% assuming mix stays constant. if we see a continued increase in weight for shipment, that could put some pressure on the reported yields, that revenue per hundredweight, but that would be a good thing. So, that's what we'll continue to watch. But I think that, with respect to the overall environment, we'll have to wait and see what the other carriers report and what their commentary is like. I can only speak for us, but the environment has been pretty stable all things considered this whole year and we've been able to continue to get our increases. And I think that proves the value proposition that we have and what we can offer shippers and being consistent with our approach. So, it hasn't impacted us, hasn't impacted our market share. Our market share has been flattish which as Marty mentioned earlier, it's typically what we see through a slower economic period. And so, I feel like we're well positioned with what we've done, how we've executed, managed our costs, managed our operating ratio through this last couple of years and feel good about our positioning whenever we can turn the page back to having a little bit of economic tailwinds for a change. It feels like we've been running against the wind for a long time now and we're ready to see things start to turn around and give us a little bit of help from an economic standpoint.\nScott Group: Makes sense. Thank you guys.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. Morning. Yeah, I know from a high-level standpoint, hopefully we are bottoming from a trend perspective. I'm just curious, are there any pockets of your customer base, whether it be retail, manufacturing, wholesale or distributor, where maybe you could point to even being some favorable volume or is it pretty much not the case? And then secondly, if we have normal seasonality from October, I think we're kind of running normal September to October. If we run normal seasonality through the balance of this quarter, is there a way to think about where tonnage could shake out in aggregate year-over-year for the quarter? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. From a breakdown of the revenue base, I mean, as you can imagine, we're seeing better performance with our retail related customers and continued weakness with our industrial related customers, which the industrial for us is 55% to 60% of our revenue. So that's certainly showing in our numbers and the decrease that we've seen. But I think ISM has been down for 22, 23 months now. And that's been the challenge that we faced over this last couple year period. But the retail has performed a little bit better. really the one thing that if you look for a bright spot would be our third-party logistics customers. 3PL represents probably a third of our revenue and we actually saw some revenue growth with our 3PL customers in the third quarter. So, to me that's a good trend because we've talked in recent quarters that we feel like there's been some modal shift that has been happening over the, I would say especially last year when that large competitor close their doors. I think people were just trying to find a home for freight and in many cases, many LTL shipments might have ended up in the truckload world. A lot of times we'll see that movement back and forth between modes, especially with the 3PLs. And so now that we're seeing an influx of business coming back in, I think whatever outflow was going, the tide is finally coming back in. And so, if we can see a continuation there, that should mean a good thing as we project out and start thinking about 2025. So that's probably the brightest spot to pick through the different customer base.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks. And then again, just any thoughts on normal volume seasonality from here for the balance of the quarter where that could kind of maybe shake out for the whole quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I mean we're a long way from there. But if we were to hit normal seasonality, that would put tonnage per day down like 6.5% to 7% for the full quarter. If you just look at kind of bigger picture, revenue, revenue per day at seasonality would be at about $1.4 billion. And we've been underperforming seasonality like I mentioned, for the last couple of years. So, if you kind of take that normal rate of underperformance, at least where we were in the third quarter, it'd be down like $1.35 billion. So, it's something to just keep in mind as we progress through the quarter and give our full updates. obviously the revenue per day in October is, it should look the worst. And then hopefully things from a comp standpoint just start looking better overall as we get into November and we'll give our mid quarter update that will help you all clean up your models from there.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Again, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. And our next question today comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning, Adam, you kind of mentioned at the end of one of your answers the uncertainty around the election. And this is a narrative that we've heard just a little bit recently about shippers maybe kind of pausing until there's a little bit more certainty. I know you have a very diverse end market of customers, but is there any way to kind of frame out what may be a temporary pause versus just the ongoing kind of industrial macro headwinds that you've been facing for the last several quarters?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I think that, obviously anytime you have uncertainty and typically when you look in election years, they haven't been the best freight years at least in recent history. And so, I think that there have been plenty of headlines and we've had customer conversations as well where, people are being a bit conservative right now and until they know what, things may look like and what impact to their business, new policy directions may take. So, I think that's something that is temporary, especially right now. But at some point, people have got to get back to looking at their business and how ultimately, they want to figure out how to grow and expand and do the things that creates freight, that will create opportunities for us. So, I think that's something that, once we can get just this level of uncertainty, that's one more thing that has kind of been potentially holding the economy back, at least for the last quarter or so. So, we get past that and start taking interest rate cuts taking effect. I think people will get back as long as we have a healthy consumer and, we're a consumer driven economy and people are buying things, inventory balances get drawn down and there's got to be replenishment at some point. And so, we feel like that inventory scale has been drawn down. And once we sort of re normalize, if you will, we'd expect that we'll be able to pick up quite a bit of freight.\nJonathan Chappell: Thanks, Adam.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, good morning. So Adam and Marty, it sounds like a consistent top line, but fixed costs are starting to run. Is there anything you can or want to do at this point to cut those costs? Maybe shed some excess capacity? Seems like that's bearing down on the industry. And just to clarify your OR comment, was that 300 to 350 basis point sequential deterioration? So, you're talking about a 75 and a half to low 76 type of number for the fourth quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, that's correct, Ken. That was the sequential guidance from the quarter that range. But, we're taking action every day and we keep our belts tight year in and year out in good times and bad. I think that if you don't know how to manage cost, if you don't manage cost in good times, you probably don't know where to start when times are tough. I think that's a lesson I learned years ago. So that's an ongoing focus for us and our team and we stay on top and have metrics from a productivity standpoint that we're always staying on top of. Our team's been very effective this year in that regard, especially when you've got a lack of density in the system. And we've expanded the system a little bit, opening five or six terminals this year. So, in the third quarter especially, we had an improvement in our platform shipments per hour. We had an improvement in our pickup delivery shipments per hour. So, some improvements there in the third quarter. Despite the volume weakness, our load factor from a linehaul standpoint has continued to face some pressure. But again, that's volume weakness and it pretty much was down in alignment with what the decrease in weight per shipment was. So, it's not atypical to see that type of performance. But to us, the most important thing is to keep giving service and running our schedules. And that's why in slower periods it can create a little bit of a cost headwind for us. But, we think it's more important to keep giving service now than ever. And so that certainly has supported the value proposition over time. with respect to our overhead cost. Yeah, those, those have been about $300 million to $305 million each quarter this year. And we look at ways and control discretionary spending. I think that in regards to cutting back on capacity, we want to keep our eye out for the long term. And we still believe in the fact that we've got a long runway for growth ahead. And that was why we expanded and executed on a CapEx plan like we did this year. Probably we'll cut back, would expect, cut back our capital expenditures into next year and grow into some of this capacity that we have. But we will look to continue to add to the network over time just due to the confidence that we have and what our market share potential can be. But probably tighten up our fleet and do some other things like that that will help with cost as we go forward. But the biggest thing will just be getting back to revenue growth. And when we think about you look at historical performance, whenever we do get into an upswing, we've had some significant revenue growth years and it's usually two years coming out of a down cycle. And whether you look at 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018, '21, '22, that's going to be where this investment through the cycle pays the biggest dividends for us. So, if we get back to having a stronger economy and get back to the market share outperformance like we've seen in the past, I feel really good about where our operating ratio is today and where it can get to with respect to those overhead charges scaling back down to where they've been as a percent of revenue, we're about five operating points. Overhead cost as a percent of revenue higher than where we were, say, back in 2022. So, there's a lot of opportunity to get us right back on path to achieve that sub-70 annual operating ratio goal that we still have.\nKen Hoexter: Great, thanks. Appreciate the thoughts.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, morning everyone. Can you share a few more details on your thoughts on this Mastio survey? I mean, you've long said that you're not hearing from your customers, that the others are closing the gap as much to you guys, as much as maybe that the narrative is out there and can we see some of that in the results as well? But is there a risk that if they're not closing up on service, they can maybe get more competitive on price? Or does it just take time for that service gap to close? So what do you think happens from here?\nAdam Satterfield: I think that's a question for the other carriers, and I don't know what their strategies are. I know what we've heard they were, and that's why we were pleased with the results this year. And that sizable gap between our performance and the others was maintained. And so, we're not going to sit around and rest on our laurels, though. We're going to continue to look for ways that we can get better. And like Marty said earlier, there's more than just to service, than just picking up and delivering freight on time. And so, there's 28 different attributes that Mastio measures, and we want to be the best in each of those. And so, we'll keep working hard to deliver solutions for our customers. And so, we've had a, have had a proven strategy that has worked for many, many years. And, we want to keep that model going and keep producing the same type of profitable growth and shareholder value that executing on this same long-term strategic plan has produced for us over time. I think it continues to work in the future. Whatever temporary decisions other carriers make, we've dealt with it for years, and I think it's something we'll continue to be able to work against as we go forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Adam, I wanted to ask about the relationship between truckload and LTL that your comments about 3PLs was pretty interesting. We've historically seen share move back and forth, but I guess through this cycle it seems like maybe more share than normal has moved back to truckload. And obviously the pricing dynamic between LTL and TL is maybe as wide as it's been in terms of the relative price, I guess, does that change anything through the next up cycle or do you think it doesn't really take a significant upturn in truckload to be able to push volume back into LTL? Obviously, you mentioned that you saw a little bit that happening in the third quarter. Just kind of curious how you think about that relationship these days.\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah, I think that obviously last year was very unusual with what happened and helped support the truckload world, gets pretty volatile with respect to the volumes and the pricing and so forth. And I think it's because of how fragmented that industry is. And so that created some freight opportunity. And on the one hand, customers just had to get their freight moved as well. And Yellow was hauling 50,000 shipments per day, picking up and delivering 50,000 shipments per day, and that freight had to go somewhere. It went to a lot of the remaining LTL carriers, but much of that I felt like, went into that truckload world as well. And we've heard people talking about consolidating shipments if they could and using truckload for zone skipping and doing some different things to try to take advantage of that lower rate environment there. But at the end of the day, if a shipment is less than 10,000 pounds, it makes more sense to be in the LTL world. And I think that that freight will come back to us in due time. Those truckload carriers don't love doing multi stops. They can charge a stop off fee for it, but that really makes sense when they're designed to really go from a to b with a full trailer. So, I think that freight does probably swing back into the LTL world maybe a little more aggressively than what we've seen through prior economic cycles. When I look at overall the data that we get on the universe, LTL shipments are down. Tonnage is down about 15% from the peak in the second quarter, 2021. So, some of that was economic loss, but I think some of it is this modal shift that we've seen and heard about as well. So, I think that whenever that kind of wave starts coming back in, I think that'll be something that will be a good opportunity for us, but directly, but then indirectly as well, it usually is going to other competitors, and those competitors end up having service issues with existing customers, and many of those customers come to us as well. So, I think that whenever we see this cycle inflection, I think we've got multiple fronts that should help us from a volume standpoint.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just a quick clarification, did you see any impact from the hurricanes on the network, either yours or some of your customers? And should that start to pick back up here, perhaps in the fourth quarter and then looking into next year, another way to look at pricing, I guess the NMFDA is looking at making some changes to the class system. I think it's going more dimensional based. It's related to the effect in the middle of next year. I don't know if you got any early comments on that in terms of implications for yourselves for the industry and perhaps the shippers as well. Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We definitely had some revenue loss related to the hurricane. And operationally, it presents some challenges as well. We were initially pleased that all of our employees got through, everything okay from everything we understand from a health standpoint as well as property standpoint. Our network was fine as well. I think we were lucky in the sense of none of our properties really suffered any significant damage. We were down for a bit, which is typical when you have big major storms like that move through, but have recovered since nicely. And there will be some ongoing disruption operationally, though, some of the interstate systems in Western North Carolina, that will continue to be impacted perhaps up to a year before some of those roadways are repaired. So that's something that our operating team though does a phenomenal job, our line-haul management team of looking and figuring out how we need to rework the system to make sure that we've got freight that if something has picked up in Eastern North Carolina going to California and any point in between, we get that freight move seamlessly and within our service standards. So pleased with respect to how the team responded to the challenges from those storms that came through. And remind me again, what was the second part of the question?\nBrian Ossenbeck: Yes. It's looking at the NMFDA, we're looking at some changes for the class system mid-2025, just thoughts on that?\nAdam Satterfield: That's, I think, a good opportunity for us. We already -- we've got dimensioners in most of our major service centers, and we're already dimensioning probably 75% of our freight today. And so that's something that we're already set up to be able to effectively accommodate. So, we'll continue to work with customers through those changes that got delayed a little bit into next year, but that's something that we'll be able to handle and may provide another strategic advantage for us against some of our competitors.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ari Rosa with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAriel Rosa: Hi Adam, Marty, Jack, just curious to hear your thoughts on the buyback. It's up quite a bit from last year. You still have a fairly modest dividend at under 1% yield, and it looks like you're obviously directing most of your capital towards the buyback as opposed to the dividend. I'm just curious what the logic is for favoring the buyback over the dividend? And is there any indication that management essentially is saying that they think the share price is undervalued?\nAdam Satterfield: Yeah. Well, the buyback was the first type of capital return program that we started back in 2014, and that was when our cash flow model was changing, and we were generating excess cash, and we still look today for the first use of cash would be for reinvesting in the company with the strong returns on invested capital that we have at 30%. But secondly would be the buybacks, and that was, as I just said, what we started with. And then we implemented the dividend program in 2017 to kind of round out all the respective requests, if you will, and preferences of different shareholders. But the buyback is obviously a tax-efficient means and provides a lot of flexibility with respect to returning capital. When we still feel like we've got quite a bit of investment ahead of us, and we're generally still spending 10% to 15% of our revenues on capital expenditures every year, but having that flexibility on the buyback will allow us to step that CapEx number up meaningfully if we needed to, based on what volume demands were and market share trends continue to be. But yes, we -- in the second quarter was really when we spent the most on the buyback this year. And some of that was just due to the stock weakness. We generally are pretty consistent quarter in and quarter out, but sort of take a grid-based approach with the consistent investment that we make. Buy more when stock's lower and less when it's higher, but consistently returning capital. But then we'll step in as need be when we see some big weakness like we did in the second quarter, and we ended up spending over $500 million in that period. And that was consistent with what we did back in 2022 as well, where the stock was under pressure, and we spent $1.3 billion that year on the buyback program. So that would be what our strategy going forward. We'll always be looking at -- we forecast outward cash flow from operations and what we think the capital needs for CapEx would look like and look at what the fixed dividend is and then that balance becomes somewhat of a target to spend on the buyback program each year, but some years may be less and some years more like what we're seeing this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning, thank you. I was hoping you could maybe shed some light on the potential cyclical freight upside? So just kind of thinking through the dynamics, obviously, with truckload, we've talked about and seeing pricing was really soft, but I think that's largely capacity driven, not so much demand on the LTL front, obviously, where you guys are playing it down, but it also seems to be down from pretty high COVID comps that you throw and obviously, the bankruptcy of Yellow. So, as we kind of think about this eventual up-cycle, what evidence or kind of are you seeing or you think you could see that would suggest that we actually see kind of an inflection or above-average volume growth? Or are we simply just kind of returning to kind of a normal trend line in demand?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think that weight per shipment is generally one of the first things that we would start seeing, and that's something that we've been down at historical lows, with our weight per shipment down below 1,500 pounds now. We've been as high as 1,600 pounds in our past. And so, we start seeing an increase in weight per shipment. Generally, that's orders for our customers' products are picking up. And so, there's more widgets on every shipment, if you will. And then eventually, there will be sufficient quantities to where that turns into multiple shipments, and so you start seeing it go from there. But that's usually the first indicator is on the weight side.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. So, I guess what you're saying is you do believe that you should see some reacceleration here and this isn't just a multiyear normalization pattern?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that, for sure, we've been in a longer slow cycle than any of us ever anticipated. Typically, when we go through a down period, it's three to four quarters and to be into this now for so long is probably somewhat skewed, as you mentioned, by COVID, creating a lot of acceleration. I mean we grew $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and another $1 billion of revenue in 2022. So maybe now things -- we've gone through a longer slow cycle after seeing a big up cycle there. But like I mentioned, I think that we're down. The industry is down about 15% from second quarter of 2021. The industry, if you go back to '09, it was on a pretty consistent growth path from '09 to '21, and ATA continues to suggest that there's growth opportunities for LTL. And we believe that as well. And we've seen the trends developing over time with e-commerce that effect on supply chains. If we continue to see near shoring and reshoring activities, that creates a lot of freight demand and opportunity for LTL. And so, we benefited from that over time and would expect that both the industry and ourselves will benefit from those trends. So, I think we've got to come out of the ditch, and we will, based on all the feedback that we have from customers and continuing those conversations, I think we get right back to some normalization. And then we'll see the industry continue to grow from there, and we'd expect that our market share will continue to grow as well. And we've increased our market share. We were at about 6% share back in 2012. And we're at 12% to 13% today. So, we've been able to significantly increase share and been the biggest market share winner really over the last 10 years. And service is what wins share. You got to have capacity, and there's been a lot of talk about the shift in capacity from the Yellow service centers that have been reallocated. But only about half of those facilities have been reallocated thus far. But once demand recovers, I think that you're going to see a more capacity-constrained industry and our service, winning share again for us into the future. So that's why we're committed to executing on our CapEx programs. And trying to invest ahead of that curve. And we're there right now. We've got about 30% excess capacity. That's more than we typically would have in our service center network. But that's what gives us confidence that once we start growing again, we can see those really strong incremental margins that we've been able to produce in the past and produce a lot of profitable growth. But it's going to take that inflection in the economy before we can get back to seeing those strong revenue growth trends and operating ratio improvement.\nStephanie Moore: I'm sorry, just Adam, real quick, operating days in 4Q, if you don't mind?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, we have 62 days this year versus 61 in 4Q of '23.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Adam, as we think about the profitability of the business as we get into next year, in a world that's been at best seasonal and a lot of times, sub-seasonal from a demand standpoint for quite some time now as you noted earlier. Can you level set what your view of a seasonal margin performance would be in the first quarter and even the second quarter, just so we can check our models? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. The first quarter is typically 100 basis points increase. And -- but again, that's if there's no real major adjustment from an insurance standpoint, the actuarial adjustments that we go through in 4Q to kind of normalizing for that. And then the second quarter is where we get the improvement. And that's where revenue is accelerating generally, and our operating ratio typically improves 400 to 450 basis points in the second quarter versus the first. And obviously, when we get into a period where you have -- not that I'm calling this now, but if we get into an environment, if you go back into a few years like 2017, for example, where if you can get above sequential revenue growth, and it gives more opportunity. To put it to the bottom line, the way our cost structure is split out now in the most recent quarter in the third quarter, our direct cost as a percent of revenue were about 52% and our overhead costs were between 20% and 21%. So, it's all that leverage that we have on those fixed costs when you get into that revenue growth environment that allows that operating ratio to swing generally in outperforming normal seasonality, if you will, when you're in those first year or two of the up cycle.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yeah. Great. Thank you. So, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on kind of where you think pricing bottoms and then if inflation is may be acting differently this cycle? It seems like that's been a source of some pressure on margins. So, if you see shipments stabilize when you go into next year, do you think about we need 4%, we just need to keep getting that 4% in order to stay flat on margin? Again, if backdrop is a stability in shipments, do you get any help on inflation easing? Or is it like -- just how you think about maybe it's like a price cost spread question or would you think about price relative to maybe what you got in prior down cycles? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. That's a good observation, Tom. I mean that variance in revenue per shipment and cost per shipment over time, we've targeted trying to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of spread of price over cost to support the investment in capacity and technology and so forth. And that's effectively reconciled with what our long-term annual operating ratio improvement has been as well. Kind of what I was just saying earlier was that first year of recovery, you get the benefit of the volumes coming in. And so, it helps you from a cost per shipment standpoint, on the -- from an overhead side, you start getting all that leverage. But this year, we had started out, after seeing some inflation on cost per shipment. Our target for this year was to see cost per shipment core, cost for shipment inflation in the 4% to 4.5% range. And I think that's where we'll end up averaging for the year. And so, we're kind of back to normal, if you will. Our longer-term average has been 3.5% to 4%. And so, the volume weakness has kept us tad north of what that longer-term trend has been. But we'll continue to execute on a bid-by-bid basis. I mean our philosophy is to look at each customer as their bids come due and look at what the opportunities are and the profitability of the accounts and try to ask for increases that will offset our cost inflation. And so that -- those are the conversations that we have, and that's what we'd expect to continue to have whatever year the up cycle starts. The benefit and how we usually have really strong performance is all the new customers that are coming on board. And usually, that drives that revenue and yield trend a little bit stronger as well. And so those will be things that we'll look for whenever we do eventually get into that next part of the cycle where we're actually seeing some increases. But I don't think to your question about the floor, we look at every quarter just like we've done this year. As we progress through the year, mix is constant, we're looking for increases because our costs aren't going down. And so, we're looking to get increases, and that's what we'd expect to see sequentially quarter after quarter.\nThomas Wadewitz: And you don't see a reason to think inflation is different kind of next year versus what you saw this year?\nAdam Satterfield: No, I think that we've got the opportunity and again, just looking at it on a per shipment basis, if we can get into some volume recovery, that's going to be the best thing that will happen. I mean long-term operating ratio improvement is produced by two main ingredients: density and yield. So, we've lacked on the density side. We've been consistent with our yield performance the last couple of years, and that is what has supported our margins. But once we can get the contribution from density coming through the network, that should keep some of those costs low. It comes through -- as I was referencing earlier, our team has done a phenomenal job of managing through in a lower density environment, keeping our service metrics high. And keeping those direct costs, I mean, in the first and second quarter, we had improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So, we've done a great job managing through in this down part of the cycle. But that's going to create a lot of opportunity. If you got higher weight per shipment, that's going to be more revenue per shipment performance when the cost to pick up is probably the same. The cost to move across the dock is consistent as well. So those are all those factors that will go in and why we generally see the cost per shipment kind of outperforming the longer-term average, if they will, when we get into those parts of the cycle. And they offset -- we've had tremendous inflation over the last couple of years. 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits. So that's the biggest driver. But as we run an efficient network and can eliminate miles from our system, that's time and that's fuel. But we've had tremendous inflation with the cost of new equipment. Our maintenance and repair cost, on a per mile basis, they've been up significantly. We've managed that a little bit better this year. But insurance cost in our industry, premium costs have been double digits. I mean this is something that all carriers are facing, and we're not immune to it, but we've been fortunate to have operating efficiencies to offset many of these higher inflationary items that we've seen when you go line by line on the income statement.\nThomas Wadewitz: Right. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hey, good morning, guys. Just want to wrap up the weight per shipment discussion here. Marty, you mentioned that you were getting fewer skids per customer. Is your sense that, that's all related to market softness? Are you seeing any pockets of others may be gunning for customer wallet share, especially as they've been improving service? And then maybe this is a little bit in the weeds, but any comments on sales force incentives that may be aimed at more business from existing customers versus new accounts that you can share with us? Thanks.\nKevin Freeman: Sure. Yes. The reduction in weight per shipment is definitely our customers just shipping less boxes on a skid. So, we see that -- as Adam said, we're positive that will pick up in the -- maybe the fourth and first quarter as Christmas comes around and you got quite a bit of holiday shipping coming up. So, we're cautiously optimistic for that. And as far as sales incentives, we incent our reps on a quarterly basis based on revenue growth, operating ratio and service. So, we paid out in the last quarter, and we look to pay out in this quarter. So, they're incented pretty well to increase their business, and that's their main goals. So, I've got confidence in our sales team to go out there and sell our value proposition and gain additional shipments.\nBruce Chan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Thank you very much and Congratulations on the Mastio accolades. I think all the good questions have been asked at this point, but I'd like to drill down a little bit on tonnage. We do follow railroads and some other industries where they say, okay, well, this part of the economy was a little weaker this quarter, this part of the economy a little stronger. I'm assuming that the truckload multi-stop is more of a retail versus an industrial product. But if you look across your customer base, I know your comment was mix is consistent, but some customers ship heavier stuff, some customers ship lighter stuff. Where are you seeing pockets of weaker-than-expected activity in your customer base? Where are you seeing pockets of stronger-than-expected activity?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I don't know that -- we get very granular with how we look at our business and slice it by SIC code that generally just try to group generally together with -- as industrial and retail. But I don't know that we've seen anything that has varied greatly what our expectations would be. I think that like I mentioned earlier, the industrial performance has been weaker. Last year, it was probably holding up a little bit better than some of the -- than what the ISM trend would have indicated. But I think just -- some of that was due to we were continuing to win new customers, and we were getting some of the new customer activity. And we're continuing to get new customers in every month. We look at our reporting and the business that we've won or that we've lost, and we're continuing to win new accounts. And so maybe some of those have been more on the retail side, and that supported why retail has outperformed. But we've got certain commodities that we hold, that obviously are going to stay, a few or hauling food products, those are going to be consistent through the cycle, pharmaceuticals, things of that nature. And so, we've seen pretty consistent performance related to what we'd expect. Probably the thing that has been most positive has been the consistency of our market share. And I've been really pleased that we've not lost really any customer accounts. We've not lost lanes from customers. So, we've been able to keep those relationships intact. And we're primed and ready whenever those customers call and if they've got two shipments per week, once the orders for their products pick up, those two turn into three to four to five to 10 and all of a sudden, instead of making the stock, we're dropping a trailer and getting a full trail load of outbound product from a manufacturing account, that's kind of how this thing will take back off again when we start seeing increased order activity. But it's going to take some time, I think, to get there. And -- but we're primed in position. We've had continued to stay engaged. Our sales team does with our customers and to understand what their needs are. We're in the midst right now of going through. We -- this is the time of the year where we build a very detailed bottoms-up forecast to help develop what our strategic planning process to prepare for next year and what that will look like. And so, we're very engaged with our customers right now to understand what their needs from us will look like as we go into 2025. But like I've said kind of in response to multiple questions, there's -- we're not out of the woods yet, so to speak, but there are some reasons to be optimistic based on what our trends have looked like thus far in October. Being closer to the seasonality with respect to tonnage of October versus September, that's the first time that we've been able to say that for some time and to see an increase in weight per shipment, those are all positive indicators. And for what may come for the rest of this fourth quarter and then we'll see what next year holds.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay, thank you for that answer and that\u2019s my one.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Adam Satterfield for any closing remarks.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our third quarter conference call. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. I am joining the call today from a separate location, therefore, please bear with us when we are taking questions if there are any connectivity issues. Old Dominion's financial results in the third quarter reflect continued softness in the domestic economy. Our revenue and earnings per diluted share both declined on a year-over-year basis during the quarter, although our market share and volume trends remained relatively consistent with the first half of the year. While the operating environment continued to be challenging. Our team did a good job of managing our variable cost and we also continue to control our discretionary spending. The deleveraging effect from the decrease in revenue, however, caused many of our cost categories to increase as a percent of revenue. This was the primary driver for the increase in our operating ratio to a 72.7 in the third quarter. We have been pleased with the consistency in our market share this year, which is consistent with our historical experience doing slower parts of the economic cycle. We continue to have strong customer retention trends and we are also winning new business. Our customers simply have had fewer shipments that they contender to us and our average weight per shipment has also remained at historical lows. The stability of our market share continues to be supported by the quality of our service and overall value that we offer to our customers. These are a few of the foundational elements of our long-term strategic plan. The OD family of employees continued to execute on these core principles during the third quarter as our own time service was 99% and our cargo claims ratio was a 0.1%. While we are incredibly proud of these service statistics, we would also like to remind you that superior service means much more than simply picking up and delivering our customers freight on time and claims free. There are plenty of other attributes that shippers consider when selecting a carrier, such as carriers' trustworthiness, ease of doing business, and the quality and responsiveness of customer service representatives. In fact, Mastio & Company measured 28 different service and value related attributes as part of its recent annual survey of shipper and logistic professionals. Mastio published the results of his 2024 study last week and we were honored to be named the number one national LTL provider for the 15 consecutive year. OD finished number one in 23 of the 28 evaluated categories measured by Mastio and maintained a sizable lead against our competition when it comes to the overall quality of service. I would like to congratulate the entire OD family of employees on this remarkable achievement and I would also like to thank this outstanding team for their commitment to our company and our customers. We continue to believe that consistency and quality of our service over the long-term has differentiated Old Dominion in the marketplace and driven our long-term profitable growth. While becoming the best carrier in the business was hard. Remaining the best carrier for 15 straight years is an incredible accomplishment and that is hard to put in perspective. Every member of the OD team has played a part in our success and I can assure you that each of us is incredibly motivated to keep delivering our promises to provide our customers with the highest standard of service. By continuing to provide best in class service to our customers day-after-day and year-after-year, we are also able to maintain our long-term and disciplined approach to pricing. We continue to focus on consistently improving our yields to sufficiently offset our cost inflation and support additional investments in capacity and technology. These ongoing investments have created incremental value for our customers in many ways, which has further enhanced our industry leading value proposition. Our customers have recognized our value proposition over time, which has allowed us to be able to earn more and more of their business. As a result, we have won more market share over the past 10 years than any carrier in our industry. While the economic environment has remained sluggish for much longer than we ever anticipated, we believe we are better positioned than ever to respond to the eventual inflection in demand that will occur as the economy improves. We have the capacity, the fleet and most importantly, the committed team of people to take advantage of an improving economic environment. Our unique company culture and each employee's commitment to excellence gives me tremendous confidence that we can also be the biggest market share winner over the next 10 years. This confidence is bolstered by the results of the most recent Mastio study as well as the ongoing conversations we have with our customers. By staying focused on long-term opportunities for additional profitable growth, we remain confident in our ability to create additional value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us on the call this morning and now Adam will discuss our third quarter in greater detail. Sure. Yes. The reduction in weight per shipment is definitely our customers just shipping less boxes on a skid. So, we see that -- as Adam said, we're positive that will pick up in the -- maybe the fourth and first quarter as Christmas comes around and you got quite a bit of holiday shipping coming up. So, we're cautiously optimistic for that. And as far as sales incentives, we incent our reps on a quarterly basis based on revenue growth, operating ratio and service. So, we paid out in the last quarter, and we look to pay out in this quarter. So, they're incented pretty well to increase their business, and that's their main goals. So, I've got confidence in our sales team to go out there and sell our value proposition and gain additional shipments."

            "content": "Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue totaled $1.47 billion for the third quarter 2024, which was a 3.0% decrease from the prior year. We had one extra workday in the third quarter of this year, so the decrease on a per day basis was 4.5%. These revenue results reflect the 4.8% decrease in LTL tons per day that was partially offset by the 1.5% increase in LTL revenue per hundred way. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the third quarter decreased 1.9% when compared to the second quarter of 2024. With LTL tons per day decreasing 3.2% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 1.0%. For comparison, the 10 year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 3.6% in revenue per day, an increase of 0.9% in LTL tons per day, and an increase of 2.3% in LTL shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the third quarter were as follows. July decreased 4.4% as compared to June, August decreased 0.8% as compared to July and September increased 1.7% as compared to August. The 10 year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 2.9% in July, an increase of 0.6% in August, and an increase of 3.5% in September. For October, we expect our revenue per day will decrease by approximately 11.2% to 11.8% when compared to October 2023, with a decrease of approximately 9.2% to 9.8% in our LTL tons per day. As usual, we will provide the actual revenue related details for October in our third quarter Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio increased 210 basis points to 72.7% for the third quarter of 2024. As Marty mentioned, the decrease in our revenue had a deleveraging effect on many of our operating expenses during the quarter. This contributed to the 110 basis point increase in our overhead cost as a percent of revenue. In addition, and for the first time this year, our direct operating cost also increased as a percent of revenue when compared to the same quarter of the prior year. The increase in our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue was primarily due to an increase in cost associated with our group health and dental plans. As a result, our employee benefit cost increased to 38.6% of salaries and wages during the third quarter of 2024 from 37.3% in the same period of the prior year. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $446.5 million for the third quarter and $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $242.8 million and $600.4 million for the same periods. We utilized $187.7 million and $824.8 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, while our cash dividends totaled $55.6 million and $168.2 million for the same periods. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter, 2024 was 23.4% as compared to 24.08% in the third quarter of 2023. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be 24.5% for the fourth quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator will be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Yeah. From a volume standpoint, the year-over-year our tonnage is in October. Take the midpoint of that range that we gave would be down about nine and a half percent. And obviously we've got many days left to finish out this month and so we'll see how the rest of the month finish is why we gave a little bit more of a range than we normally do. But if you take the midpoint of that in October, that's got our sequential change down. Just call it about 3.5%. The 10-year average sequential is a decrease of 3.1% and that's October versus September. So, it's actually encouraging to see what our volume trends so far this month have been. This is the first time that we've been, I would say relatively close to what our normal sequential changes have been in the first month of the quarter. So, we feel pretty good about how volumes are trending and continued strength in our yield performance that we've seen as well. So, we'll continue to watch that. But the year-over-year I think is just skewed a bit by, if you recall last year, we had a competitor that had a cybersecurity issue and we had some temporary freight coming into the system, if you will. So, we picked up some incremental freight there that was a bit unusual and caused outperformance from a seasonality standpoint that obviously is not there right now. But feeling good thus far about the October trend. Yeah, I was going to try to leave that maybe for someone else. Those are two big questions packed into one. So just try to keep questions to one. But just to go ahead and address that because we know it's going to be a question anyways. The normal 3Q to 4Q regression is about a 200 to 250 basis point deterioration, and that's excluding any insurance adjustments. We do an actuarial assessment in the fourth quarter every year. Sometimes those are good guys. Sometimes like last year, I think we had about a 70 basis point headwind when it came to the actuarial adjustment. It was an unfavorable adjustment last year. So, I think when thinking about this fourth quarter, conservatively, I think we probably ought to slide that scale up about 100 basis points. And the reason for that would just be the continued risk from a revenue standpoint and the impact that would have on overhead expenses. We just saw that headwind play out in the third quarter kind of going back to the guidance that we gave at the end of the second quarter call, going into 2Q. Revenue came in softer and as a result our overhead expenses were about 40 basis points higher than kind of what we had anticipated at the end of the second quarter call. And then I think we also have a continued risk with respect to our fringe benefit costs. Those were higher than what the trend has been this year and higher than what they had been for the same period last year in the third quarter. And so, I think there's a continued risk those may stay a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. But both of those things are something that could trend better. I think if we have like I mentioned earlier, the October trend is starting out pretty good from a volume standpoint. So, if we can get our revenues back closer to seasonality, if you will, and obviously we'll give our mid quarter updates, then there can be some favorability there, but just some pluses and minuses. And I think from a conservative standpoint, probably better to just slide that scale up in terms of where things stand right now. Yeah, I think that's fair. I think the October, is definitely the toughest comp when I go back and look at last year's sequential performance in November versus October, our tonnage was down six tenths of a percent. And our 10-year average there is a 3.1% increase. And then December outperformed. We were down 4.8% in December of '23 versus November of '23. The 10-year average there is 7%. So, I think that this is probably the toughest comp, if you will, of the quarter in October. But depending on how November trends, if we get some acceleration back in the business. And then obviously December is always a tough month for everyone given the holidays and whatnot. But if we can kind of hang on, we had a little bit of outperformance there. So December will be a little bit tougher versus the November. But I think on the whole, as we go through this fourth quarter, this feels like we're finally getting to what we hope is a floor. We're encouraged about how things are trending. It's good to see the sequential performance thus far in October and obviously it got many days to get through this quarter. And 1Q is also tough to think about from a big picture standpoint. We've been underperforming normal sequential trends for about two and a half years now. So, it certainly feels like we're finally coming to the end of a cycle. We've got to go through these tough quarters, but we finally have seen, I think traction with respect to interest rates are declining. We'll have the uncertainty of the election behind us pretty soon. And so hopefully we get back to seeing some growth for our industry for which typically when the industry starts to inflect to the positive, that's when our model shines the brightest and we win the most share. So, we're looking forward to getting through this final quarter here of the year and starting out next year with hopefully some good strength. The weight per shipment last year? It was pretty much right in line with what our normal tenure average would be. So we were, in October last year we were down three tenths of a percent and then pretty much performed about in alignment with what normal weight per shipment would trend. Typically, you'll get a little bit of an increase in weight for shipment from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And that's something that actually was a little bit of a surprise for us in the third quarter our weight for shipment ticked down a bit. And July was somewhat consistent. And I'm speaking of this year now, July was pretty consistent, consistent with our 10-year average. But then it dropped further in August, came back a little bit in September. But overall kind of underperformed what the weight would be. But at this point we've actually in October seeing a bit of an increase. So, typically the 10-year average in October, like I just said, is down three tenth. So, if we're seeing a little bit of an increase, that's obviously a good thing for business as well. We're getting more weight per shipment, going to have a little bit higher revenue per shipment as well. And that generally drives improved productivity also. And hopefully that generally has been a sign of hope with respect to the economy as well. So that would be another metric to continue to watch to see if we see things start to pick up for us. Yeah, I was pleased with our yield performance through the third quarter. And it takes having superior service to support what we're able to achieve consistently year in and year out from a yield performance. And so, we're really, really proud of the service metrics we've been able to deliver. And just to repeat, winning that Mastio award for the 15 straight years, hopefully has put to bed some of the faults that that gap between us and our competitors has closed and so really pleased to see that performance with this year's results. But I think at the end of the last call we talked about normal seasonality with respect to our revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges. And that would have put us in the 4% to 4.5% range for the third quarter. And we came in at the top end of that range and granted we had a little bit lower weight per shipment as just was referencing with Jason. But so that certainly helped the revenue per hundredweight. But to me it just seemed like consistent performance through the quarter and that's what we would continue to expect. Our yield management process is we take a long-term and consistent approach that tries to offset our cost inflation and support continued investments in our network and in our technologies and so forth. So, if normal seasonality plays out for the fourth quarter, that would put that revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel, up in the 3.8% to 4.2% type of range. And we'll continue to watch that as we go through, but we expect to continue to get increases. We're seeing it, we've seen it throughout this year and really throughout the last two and a half years that we've been in this weak economic period and so just continue to execute on that consistent philosophy and we're getting increases as we go through bid renewals and that would be the same expectation as we go through this year and would be the same as we go through next year as well. Yeah. Just to address, October and we didn't give the exact number, but you can kind of back into it. the revenue per hundredweight with fuel, right now is trending down, but a lot of that is fuel related. Fuel at this point is down about 20% compared to October of last year. So, a bigger drop, if you will, compared to what we just saw in the third quarter and that should moderate as we progress through the fourth quarter. It was about $4.50 a gallon last year in October, but ended up averaging about $4.25 for the full fourth quarter of last year. So that's something that will moderate a bit and anytime looking at one-month trends as well, given some of that disruption that we had last year, you had some mix issues going on and so forth. So, we would still expect to see that sequential trend play out like I just mentioned, and overall yields ex fuel being up in that 3.8% to 4.2% assuming mix stays constant. if we see a continued increase in weight for shipment, that could put some pressure on the reported yields, that revenue per hundredweight, but that would be a good thing. So, that's what we'll continue to watch. But I think that, with respect to the overall environment, we'll have to wait and see what the other carriers report and what their commentary is like. I can only speak for us, but the environment has been pretty stable all things considered this whole year and we've been able to continue to get our increases. And I think that proves the value proposition that we have and what we can offer shippers and being consistent with our approach. So, it hasn't impacted us, hasn't impacted our market share. Our market share has been flattish which as Marty mentioned earlier, it's typically what we see through a slower economic period. And so, I feel like we're well positioned with what we've done, how we've executed, managed our costs, managed our operating ratio through this last couple of years and feel good about our positioning whenever we can turn the page back to having a little bit of economic tailwinds for a change. It feels like we've been running against the wind for a long time now and we're ready to see things start to turn around and give us a little bit of help from an economic standpoint. Yeah. From a breakdown of the revenue base, I mean, as you can imagine, we're seeing better performance with our retail related customers and continued weakness with our industrial related customers, which the industrial for us is 55% to 60% of our revenue. So that's certainly showing in our numbers and the decrease that we've seen. But I think ISM has been down for 22, 23 months now. And that's been the challenge that we faced over this last couple year period. But the retail has performed a little bit better. really the one thing that if you look for a bright spot would be our third-party logistics customers. 3PL represents probably a third of our revenue and we actually saw some revenue growth with our 3PL customers in the third quarter. So, to me that's a good trend because we've talked in recent quarters that we feel like there's been some modal shift that has been happening over the, I would say especially last year when that large competitor close their doors. I think people were just trying to find a home for freight and in many cases, many LTL shipments might have ended up in the truckload world. A lot of times we'll see that movement back and forth between modes, especially with the 3PLs. And so now that we're seeing an influx of business coming back in, I think whatever outflow was going, the tide is finally coming back in. And so, if we can see a continuation there, that should mean a good thing as we project out and start thinking about 2025. So that's probably the brightest spot to pick through the different customer base. Yeah, I mean we're a long way from there. But if we were to hit normal seasonality, that would put tonnage per day down like 6.5% to 7% for the full quarter. If you just look at kind of bigger picture, revenue, revenue per day at seasonality would be at about $1.4 billion. And we've been underperforming seasonality like I mentioned, for the last couple of years. So, if you kind of take that normal rate of underperformance, at least where we were in the third quarter, it'd be down like $1.35 billion. So, it's something to just keep in mind as we progress through the quarter and give our full updates. obviously the revenue per day in October is, it should look the worst. And then hopefully things from a comp standpoint just start looking better overall as we get into November and we'll give our mid quarter update that will help you all clean up your models from there. Yeah, I think that, obviously anytime you have uncertainty and typically when you look in election years, they haven't been the best freight years at least in recent history. And so, I think that there have been plenty of headlines and we've had customer conversations as well where, people are being a bit conservative right now and until they know what, things may look like and what impact to their business, new policy directions may take. So, I think that's something that is temporary, especially right now. But at some point, people have got to get back to looking at their business and how ultimately, they want to figure out how to grow and expand and do the things that creates freight, that will create opportunities for us. So, I think that's something that, once we can get just this level of uncertainty, that's one more thing that has kind of been potentially holding the economy back, at least for the last quarter or so. So, we get past that and start taking interest rate cuts taking effect. I think people will get back as long as we have a healthy consumer and, we're a consumer driven economy and people are buying things, inventory balances get drawn down and there's got to be replenishment at some point. And so, we feel like that inventory scale has been drawn down. And once we sort of re normalize, if you will, we'd expect that we'll be able to pick up quite a bit of freight. Yeah, that's correct, Ken. That was the sequential guidance from the quarter that range. But, we're taking action every day and we keep our belts tight year in and year out in good times and bad. I think that if you don't know how to manage cost, if you don't manage cost in good times, you probably don't know where to start when times are tough. I think that's a lesson I learned years ago. So that's an ongoing focus for us and our team and we stay on top and have metrics from a productivity standpoint that we're always staying on top of. Our team's been very effective this year in that regard, especially when you've got a lack of density in the system. And we've expanded the system a little bit, opening five or six terminals this year. So, in the third quarter especially, we had an improvement in our platform shipments per hour. We had an improvement in our pickup delivery shipments per hour. So, some improvements there in the third quarter. Despite the volume weakness, our load factor from a linehaul standpoint has continued to face some pressure. But again, that's volume weakness and it pretty much was down in alignment with what the decrease in weight per shipment was. So, it's not atypical to see that type of performance. But to us, the most important thing is to keep giving service and running our schedules. And that's why in slower periods it can create a little bit of a cost headwind for us. But, we think it's more important to keep giving service now than ever. And so that certainly has supported the value proposition over time. with respect to our overhead cost. Yeah, those, those have been about $300 million to $305 million each quarter this year. And we look at ways and control discretionary spending. I think that in regards to cutting back on capacity, we want to keep our eye out for the long term. And we still believe in the fact that we've got a long runway for growth ahead. And that was why we expanded and executed on a CapEx plan like we did this year. Probably we'll cut back, would expect, cut back our capital expenditures into next year and grow into some of this capacity that we have. But we will look to continue to add to the network over time just due to the confidence that we have and what our market share potential can be. But probably tighten up our fleet and do some other things like that that will help with cost as we go forward. But the biggest thing will just be getting back to revenue growth. And when we think about you look at historical performance, whenever we do get into an upswing, we've had some significant revenue growth years and it's usually two years coming out of a down cycle. And whether you look at 2010, 2011, 2017, 2018, '21, '22, that's going to be where this investment through the cycle pays the biggest dividends for us. So, if we get back to having a stronger economy and get back to the market share outperformance like we've seen in the past, I feel really good about where our operating ratio is today and where it can get to with respect to those overhead charges scaling back down to where they've been as a percent of revenue, we're about five operating points. Overhead cost as a percent of revenue higher than where we were, say, back in 2022. So, there's a lot of opportunity to get us right back on path to achieve that sub-70 annual operating ratio goal that we still have. I think that's a question for the other carriers, and I don't know what their strategies are. I know what we've heard they were, and that's why we were pleased with the results this year. And that sizable gap between our performance and the others was maintained. And so, we're not going to sit around and rest on our laurels, though. We're going to continue to look for ways that we can get better. And like Marty said earlier, there's more than just to service, than just picking up and delivering freight on time. And so, there's 28 different attributes that Mastio measures, and we want to be the best in each of those. And so, we'll keep working hard to deliver solutions for our customers. And so, we've had a, have had a proven strategy that has worked for many, many years. And, we want to keep that model going and keep producing the same type of profitable growth and shareholder value that executing on this same long-term strategic plan has produced for us over time. I think it continues to work in the future. Whatever temporary decisions other carriers make, we've dealt with it for years, and I think it's something we'll continue to be able to work against as we go forward. Yeah, I think that obviously last year was very unusual with what happened and helped support the truckload world, gets pretty volatile with respect to the volumes and the pricing and so forth. And I think it's because of how fragmented that industry is. And so that created some freight opportunity. And on the one hand, customers just had to get their freight moved as well. And Yellow was hauling 50,000 shipments per day, picking up and delivering 50,000 shipments per day, and that freight had to go somewhere. It went to a lot of the remaining LTL carriers, but much of that I felt like, went into that truckload world as well. And we've heard people talking about consolidating shipments if they could and using truckload for zone skipping and doing some different things to try to take advantage of that lower rate environment there. But at the end of the day, if a shipment is less than 10,000 pounds, it makes more sense to be in the LTL world. And I think that that freight will come back to us in due time. Those truckload carriers don't love doing multi stops. They can charge a stop off fee for it, but that really makes sense when they're designed to really go from a to b with a full trailer. So, I think that freight does probably swing back into the LTL world maybe a little more aggressively than what we've seen through prior economic cycles. When I look at overall the data that we get on the universe, LTL shipments are down. Tonnage is down about 15% from the peak in the second quarter, 2021. So, some of that was economic loss, but I think some of it is this modal shift that we've seen and heard about as well. So, I think that whenever that kind of wave starts coming back in, I think that'll be something that will be a good opportunity for us, but directly, but then indirectly as well, it usually is going to other competitors, and those competitors end up having service issues with existing customers, and many of those customers come to us as well. So, I think that whenever we see this cycle inflection, I think we've got multiple fronts that should help us from a volume standpoint. Yes. We definitely had some revenue loss related to the hurricane. And operationally, it presents some challenges as well. We were initially pleased that all of our employees got through, everything okay from everything we understand from a health standpoint as well as property standpoint. Our network was fine as well. I think we were lucky in the sense of none of our properties really suffered any significant damage. We were down for a bit, which is typical when you have big major storms like that move through, but have recovered since nicely. And there will be some ongoing disruption operationally, though, some of the interstate systems in Western North Carolina, that will continue to be impacted perhaps up to a year before some of those roadways are repaired. So that's something that our operating team though does a phenomenal job, our line-haul management team of looking and figuring out how we need to rework the system to make sure that we've got freight that if something has picked up in Eastern North Carolina going to California and any point in between, we get that freight move seamlessly and within our service standards. So pleased with respect to how the team responded to the challenges from those storms that came through. And remind me again, what was the second part of the question? That's, I think, a good opportunity for us. We already -- we've got dimensioners in most of our major service centers, and we're already dimensioning probably 75% of our freight today. And so that's something that we're already set up to be able to effectively accommodate. So, we'll continue to work with customers through those changes that got delayed a little bit into next year, but that's something that we'll be able to handle and may provide another strategic advantage for us against some of our competitors. Yeah. Well, the buyback was the first type of capital return program that we started back in 2014, and that was when our cash flow model was changing, and we were generating excess cash, and we still look today for the first use of cash would be for reinvesting in the company with the strong returns on invested capital that we have at 30%. But secondly would be the buybacks, and that was, as I just said, what we started with. And then we implemented the dividend program in 2017 to kind of round out all the respective requests, if you will, and preferences of different shareholders. But the buyback is obviously a tax-efficient means and provides a lot of flexibility with respect to returning capital. When we still feel like we've got quite a bit of investment ahead of us, and we're generally still spending 10% to 15% of our revenues on capital expenditures every year, but having that flexibility on the buyback will allow us to step that CapEx number up meaningfully if we needed to, based on what volume demands were and market share trends continue to be. But yes, we -- in the second quarter was really when we spent the most on the buyback this year. And some of that was just due to the stock weakness. We generally are pretty consistent quarter in and quarter out, but sort of take a grid-based approach with the consistent investment that we make. Buy more when stock's lower and less when it's higher, but consistently returning capital. But then we'll step in as need be when we see some big weakness like we did in the second quarter, and we ended up spending over $500 million in that period. And that was consistent with what we did back in 2022 as well, where the stock was under pressure, and we spent $1.3 billion that year on the buyback program. So that would be what our strategy going forward. We'll always be looking at -- we forecast outward cash flow from operations and what we think the capital needs for CapEx would look like and look at what the fixed dividend is and then that balance becomes somewhat of a target to spend on the buyback program each year, but some years may be less and some years more like what we're seeing this year. Yes. I think that weight per shipment is generally one of the first things that we would start seeing, and that's something that we've been down at historical lows, with our weight per shipment down below 1,500 pounds now. We've been as high as 1,600 pounds in our past. And so, we start seeing an increase in weight per shipment. Generally, that's orders for our customers' products are picking up. And so, there's more widgets on every shipment, if you will. And then eventually, there will be sufficient quantities to where that turns into multiple shipments, and so you start seeing it go from there. But that's usually the first indicator is on the weight side. Well, I think that, for sure, we've been in a longer slow cycle than any of us ever anticipated. Typically, when we go through a down period, it's three to four quarters and to be into this now for so long is probably somewhat skewed, as you mentioned, by COVID, creating a lot of acceleration. I mean we grew $1 billion of revenue in 2021 and another $1 billion of revenue in 2022. So maybe now things -- we've gone through a longer slow cycle after seeing a big up cycle there. But like I mentioned, I think that we're down. The industry is down about 15% from second quarter of 2021. The industry, if you go back to '09, it was on a pretty consistent growth path from '09 to '21, and ATA continues to suggest that there's growth opportunities for LTL. And we believe that as well. And we've seen the trends developing over time with e-commerce that effect on supply chains. If we continue to see near shoring and reshoring activities, that creates a lot of freight demand and opportunity for LTL. And so, we benefited from that over time and would expect that both the industry and ourselves will benefit from those trends. So, I think we've got to come out of the ditch, and we will, based on all the feedback that we have from customers and continuing those conversations, I think we get right back to some normalization. And then we'll see the industry continue to grow from there, and we'd expect that our market share will continue to grow as well. And we've increased our market share. We were at about 6% share back in 2012. And we're at 12% to 13% today. So, we've been able to significantly increase share and been the biggest market share winner really over the last 10 years. And service is what wins share. You got to have capacity, and there's been a lot of talk about the shift in capacity from the Yellow service centers that have been reallocated. But only about half of those facilities have been reallocated thus far. But once demand recovers, I think that you're going to see a more capacity-constrained industry and our service, winning share again for us into the future. So that's why we're committed to executing on our CapEx programs. And trying to invest ahead of that curve. And we're there right now. We've got about 30% excess capacity. That's more than we typically would have in our service center network. But that's what gives us confidence that once we start growing again, we can see those really strong incremental margins that we've been able to produce in the past and produce a lot of profitable growth. But it's going to take that inflection in the economy before we can get back to seeing those strong revenue growth trends and operating ratio improvement. Yes, we have 62 days this year versus 61 in 4Q of '23. Yes. The first quarter is typically 100 basis points increase. And -- but again, that's if there's no real major adjustment from an insurance standpoint, the actuarial adjustments that we go through in 4Q to kind of normalizing for that. And then the second quarter is where we get the improvement. And that's where revenue is accelerating generally, and our operating ratio typically improves 400 to 450 basis points in the second quarter versus the first. And obviously, when we get into a period where you have -- not that I'm calling this now, but if we get into an environment, if you go back into a few years like 2017, for example, where if you can get above sequential revenue growth, and it gives more opportunity. To put it to the bottom line, the way our cost structure is split out now in the most recent quarter in the third quarter, our direct cost as a percent of revenue were about 52% and our overhead costs were between 20% and 21%. So, it's all that leverage that we have on those fixed costs when you get into that revenue growth environment that allows that operating ratio to swing generally in outperforming normal seasonality, if you will, when you're in those first year or two of the up cycle. Yes. That's a good observation, Tom. I mean that variance in revenue per shipment and cost per shipment over time, we've targeted trying to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of spread of price over cost to support the investment in capacity and technology and so forth. And that's effectively reconciled with what our long-term annual operating ratio improvement has been as well. Kind of what I was just saying earlier was that first year of recovery, you get the benefit of the volumes coming in. And so, it helps you from a cost per shipment standpoint, on the -- from an overhead side, you start getting all that leverage. But this year, we had started out, after seeing some inflation on cost per shipment. Our target for this year was to see cost per shipment core, cost for shipment inflation in the 4% to 4.5% range. And I think that's where we'll end up averaging for the year. And so, we're kind of back to normal, if you will. Our longer-term average has been 3.5% to 4%. And so, the volume weakness has kept us tad north of what that longer-term trend has been. But we'll continue to execute on a bid-by-bid basis. I mean our philosophy is to look at each customer as their bids come due and look at what the opportunities are and the profitability of the accounts and try to ask for increases that will offset our cost inflation. And so that -- those are the conversations that we have, and that's what we'd expect to continue to have whatever year the up cycle starts. The benefit and how we usually have really strong performance is all the new customers that are coming on board. And usually, that drives that revenue and yield trend a little bit stronger as well. And so those will be things that we'll look for whenever we do eventually get into that next part of the cycle where we're actually seeing some increases. But I don't think to your question about the floor, we look at every quarter just like we've done this year. As we progress through the year, mix is constant, we're looking for increases because our costs aren't going down. And so, we're looking to get increases, and that's what we'd expect to see sequentially quarter after quarter. No, I think that we've got the opportunity and again, just looking at it on a per shipment basis, if we can get into some volume recovery, that's going to be the best thing that will happen. I mean long-term operating ratio improvement is produced by two main ingredients: density and yield. So, we've lacked on the density side. We've been consistent with our yield performance the last couple of years, and that is what has supported our margins. But once we can get the contribution from density coming through the network, that should keep some of those costs low. It comes through -- as I was referencing earlier, our team has done a phenomenal job of managing through in a lower density environment, keeping our service metrics high. And keeping those direct costs, I mean, in the first and second quarter, we had improvement in our direct cost as a percent of revenue. So, we've done a great job managing through in this down part of the cycle. But that's going to create a lot of opportunity. If you got higher weight per shipment, that's going to be more revenue per shipment performance when the cost to pick up is probably the same. The cost to move across the dock is consistent as well. So those are all those factors that will go in and why we generally see the cost per shipment kind of outperforming the longer-term average, if they will, when we get into those parts of the cycle. And they offset -- we've had tremendous inflation over the last couple of years. 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits. So that's the biggest driver. But as we run an efficient network and can eliminate miles from our system, that's time and that's fuel. But we've had tremendous inflation with the cost of new equipment. Our maintenance and repair cost, on a per mile basis, they've been up significantly. We've managed that a little bit better this year. But insurance cost in our industry, premium costs have been double digits. I mean this is something that all carriers are facing, and we're not immune to it, but we've been fortunate to have operating efficiencies to offset many of these higher inflationary items that we've seen when you go line by line on the income statement. Yes. I don't know that -- we get very granular with how we look at our business and slice it by SIC code that generally just try to group generally together with -- as industrial and retail. But I don't know that we've seen anything that has varied greatly what our expectations would be. I think that like I mentioned earlier, the industrial performance has been weaker. Last year, it was probably holding up a little bit better than some of the -- than what the ISM trend would have indicated. But I think just -- some of that was due to we were continuing to win new customers, and we were getting some of the new customer activity. And we're continuing to get new customers in every month. We look at our reporting and the business that we've won or that we've lost, and we're continuing to win new accounts. And so maybe some of those have been more on the retail side, and that supported why retail has outperformed. But we've got certain commodities that we hold, that obviously are going to stay, a few or hauling food products, those are going to be consistent through the cycle, pharmaceuticals, things of that nature. And so, we've seen pretty consistent performance related to what we'd expect. Probably the thing that has been most positive has been the consistency of our market share. And I've been really pleased that we've not lost really any customer accounts. We've not lost lanes from customers. So, we've been able to keep those relationships intact. And we're primed and ready whenever those customers call and if they've got two shipments per week, once the orders for their products pick up, those two turn into three to four to five to 10 and all of a sudden, instead of making the stock, we're dropping a trailer and getting a full trail load of outbound product from a manufacturing account, that's kind of how this thing will take back off again when we start seeing increased order activity. But it's going to take some time, I think, to get there. And -- but we're primed in position. We've had continued to stay engaged. Our sales team does with our customers and to understand what their needs are. We're in the midst right now of going through. We -- this is the time of the year where we build a very detailed bottoms-up forecast to help develop what our strategic planning process to prepare for next year and what that will look like. And so, we're very engaged with our customers right now to understand what their needs from us will look like as we go into 2025. But like I've said kind of in response to multiple questions, there's -- we're not out of the woods yet, so to speak, but there are some reasons to be optimistic based on what our trends have looked like thus far in October. Being closer to the seasonality with respect to tonnage of October versus September, that's the first time that we've been able to say that for some time and to see an increase in weight per shipment, those are all positive indicators. And for what may come for the rest of this fourth quarter and then we'll see what next year holds. Well, thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions, and feel free to give us a call if you have anything further. Thanks, and have a great day."

Marty, please go ahead, sir.\nMarty Freeman: Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's second quarter results represent our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings per diluted share despite the ongoing sluggish in the domestic economy. These results were made possible by the hard work and dedication of the OD family of employees who continue to execute our long-term strategic plan during the second quarter. I'd like to congratulate our outstanding team for maintaining our commitment to providing superior customer service at a fair price as well as our disciplined approach to managing yield, our laser focus on operating efficiencies and controlling our discretionary spending. Delivering superior service at a fair price is the cornerstone of our business model and our unmatched value proposition has continued to differentiate old Dominion Freight Line from our competition. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter we once again provided an on time service level of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%.\nMastio: Our strong track record of industry leading service also means our customers view us as a trusted partner, which supports our consistent cost based approach to pricing. Our long-term yield management strategy is designed to help offset our cost inflation while also supporting further investments in the capacity and technology that our customers expect. We have been one of the only LTL carriers to constantly and consistently invest in new capacity over the past 10 years, which has supported our ability to almost double our market share over the same period. We are committed to constantly investing ahead of our anticipated growth curve, which is another differentiating quality for old dominion and what has been and what we believe will continue to be a capacity constrained industry. Over the past 10 years, we have invested over $2 billion in our service center network and we plan to invest another $350 million on real estate this year. These investments have positioned us to grow with our customers over time through the ups and downs of the economic cycle, which hasn't been the case with most of our competitors. Maintaining excess capacity in our service center network, which is approximately 30% at the end of the second quarter, does create some short-term cost headwinds during periods with slower demand, but we are confident that the capacity will be critical to support our customers when the economic environment starts to improve and business levels reaccelerate. With all that said, our network investments are not being made simply to handle the overflow during stronger periods of economic activity. Instead, as we look into the future, we believe demand for service sensitive LTF capacity will continue to grow. We believe that the combination of our best-in-class service and disciplined investments in network capacity position us to capture even more of the growing market in the years ahead. Over the last decade, Old Dominion Freight Line has won more market share than any other LTL carrier by consistently executing our strategic plan and remaining focused on long-term opportunities instead of short-term challenges. While we continue to wait on a recovery in the domestic economy, we believe the investments in our network, our technology, and most importantly, our people will continue to drive value to our customers. As a result, we believe we are the best positioned carrier in our industry to win market share over the long-term, while further enhancing shareholder value. Thank you today for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail.

Thank you today for joining us this morning and now Adam will discuss our second quarter financial results in greater detail. Now, Adam?\nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 of $1.5 billion was a 6.1% increase from the prior year. The increase in revenue was due to a 4.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 1.9% increase in LTL tons per day. Our operating ratio improved to 71.9%, which contributed to the 11.3% increase in earnings per diluted share to $1.48 for the core. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the second quarter increased 2.6% when compared to the first quarter of 2024 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.3% and LTL shipments per day increasing 3.2%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 8.7% in revenue per day, an increase of 5.8% in tons per day, and an increase of 6.5% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the second quarter were as follows. April increased 0.4% as compared to March, May increased 0.1% as compared to April, and June increased 1.9% as compared to May. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 0.4% in April, an increase of 2.7% in May and an increase of 2.3% in June. I would like to note, however, that in years when Good Friday occurs in March, as it did this year, the average sequential change in LTL tons per day from March to April is a 2.6% increase. For July, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 4% to 4.5% when compared to July of 2023 assuming the remaining days of the month follow normal historical trends. The growth rate in our revenue per day through the first half of July was relatively consistent with the second quarter. The comparisons have now become a little more difficult, however; as the final week of July last year was when we began to see freight diversion from a large competitor that ultimately filed for bankruptcy. We will provide the actual revenue related details for July and our second quarter. Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 40 basis points to 71.9% for the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to the quality of our revenue growth and continued focus on operating efficiencies. Our team continued to do a great job of managing our direct variable costs during the second quarter, which allowed us to improve these costs as a percent of revenue. Our overhead costs, however, continued to increase as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to minimize discretionary spending. As we have often said before, the two main ingredients to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. While we continue to execute on our yield management initiatives, it will likely take an improvement in the domestic economy before we see sustained momentum in shipping demand that generally leads to incremental market share opportunities and operating density. We remain confident that once we have both of these elements working again in our favor, our team can produce further improvement in our operating ratio and make progress towards our goal of achieving a sub-70 annual OR. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $387.8 million and $811.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $238.1 million and $357.6 million for those same periods. We utilized $551.8 million and $637.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $56.0 million and $112.6 million for the same periods. This year-to-date total for share repurchases includes $40 million that is deferred until the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement, which would be no later than November of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 24.5%, which was lower than originally expected due to the benefit of certain discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for the second quarter 2023 was 25.4%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25% for the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes hi, good morning. Thanks for the update. Hey, I wonder, as you often do, is it possible to get some sense for, given the context of revenue per day and what you're seeing in the economy, how things could look seasonally, 2Q to 3Q in terms of the operating ratio? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, sir. Unfortunately, we're still dealing with an economy that's not contributing too much to us right now with 55% to 60% of our revenue being industrial related. The ISM continues to be below 50, and I think that's 19 out of the past 20 months. So it's hard to say what will happen from a top line basis and as you know, the revenue will dictate a lot of the performance, at least when we go sequentially. But I feel like some things have -- there have been some bright spots to look at in terms of the trend that we saw through June and so far this month in July, from a revenue and a volume standpoint. So we'll see how that continues to play out as we progress through the quarter and as we always do we will give our mid quarter update with the august performance once that is finished. But based on kind of where we are today, normal seasonality is typically about a 50 basis point increase sequentially from the second to the third quarter, and I think that's achievable. It's certainly what the goal would be, and I think that regardless of which way the revenue goes, if we stay kind of flattish like we've seen from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, typically the average sequential change in revenue is about a 3.5% increase from the second to the third quarter. So wherever we fall along that spectrum from a top line basis, I still think that something along the lines of that 50 basis point sequential increase plus or minus of course, we generally give ourselves kind of plus or minus 20 basis points. But I think that's something that's certainly very achievable for the third quarter.\nJordan Alliger: And just as a quick follow up, if I could just on the demand, you mentioned the sub-50 ISM and new orders index as well. I mean, as you sort of look ahead and talk to customers, I mean do you feel that there could be finally some change in that as we move through the year or is it tough to tell still?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think it's still tough to tell. I mean, I feel like things are starting to thaw a little bit. Again, I felt like we had a good performance through June. We finally had some, some good sequential increase there from a volume standpoint. And so a little bit of acceleration and somewhat similar to what we had in the final month of the first quarter with March there, but a nice increase from the May to June period. So it's something that we'll continue to watch. We've got the third quarter here, and then we typically go through the seasonally slower fourth quarter and first quarter. But hopefully some things are building. I think when you look at some of the macroeconomic factors would suggest that maybe some of the things that the Fed would watch would indicate that we may be closer to the interest rate environment may be improving a little bit and seeing some cuts out there that would certainly help from a business standpoint. So it seems like we're coming close to the end of a long, slow cycle, and we'll just have to continue to watch and see what's presented to us. But it certainly feels like we're seeing a little bit more opportunity out there than what we have been seeing.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Imbro: Yes, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Maybe Adam I wanted to ask one on the pricing side. I think the mid quarter update suggested pricing was stable. June actually seemed to have improved a bit. I guess how has pricing continued into July? Are we seeing any changes? And stepping back just from an industry standpoint, demand remains tepid to your point, can the industry support further GRIs and other rate increases in the back half of this year as comparisons get more difficult? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think what we've seen is just a continuation of executing on our long-term yield management philosophy, and we continue to target increases that offset our cost inflation and support the continued investment in capacity and technologies that our customers expect from us. And our yield trend in June and what we're seeing thus far in July is pretty similar from a year-over-year standpoint. If you just sort of look at normal seasonality and revenue per hundredweight, at least excluding fuel, normal sequential would imply that for the full quarter it would be up 4% to 4.5%, that metric, and some of that will be some mix change that we'll go through more so in August and September. If you think last year, following the disruption to the industry, our weight for shipment decreased quite a bit as we moved through August and September last year. Overall for the third quarter of 2023, it was down about 30 pounds versus the second quarter of 2023. So had that reduction in weight for shipment, and I would like to see that at least our weight per shipment has been stable. If that continues to increase further and a reflection, if there is any improvement in the economy, then that just becomes more challenging from a mix standpoint. But so far, what we've seen in July is pretty consistent with where we were in the second quarter, in June in particular. So we'll continue to see how that plays out.\nDaniel Imbro: Thanks so much. Best of luck guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe, Adam, if you could talk a little bit about weight per shipment trends. It's pretty flattish the last couple of quarters and certainly sequentially from 1Q to 2Q, just kind of your general thoughts on how you see that playing out. Obviously that could be part of just a sluggish economy as we're moving forward here. But if we can get a sense of maybe what you're seeing in July if there's any change in that.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, no real change in July, still kind of continuing to bounce around that 1500 pounds mark. And to me I think that's what we've seen. Obviously we saw the unique change that happened last year right at the end of July going into August. And that took our weight down quite a bit like I just mentioned. But it just feels like we've been bouncing along the bottom and I think that's an indicator really where the industrial economy has been as well. So I think that should be one of the first signs and early indicators. If we start seeing some incremental weight on each shipment that we're picking up, that orders might be picking up and that would obviously be good for a lot of measurements. If we can get more weight per shipment, generally that's going to lead to the improvement in operating efficiencies and generally that leads into improved volumes in general if the underlying economy truly is improving. So all things that we are very prepared for in terms of the capacity in our service center network, the capacity of our people and our fleet, we are primed and in position to respond whenever the market does. In fact inflect to the positive.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Adam, just a couple of follow-ups if I can. First, the 4% to 4.5% revenue, any sense of breaking that down between tonnage and then yield? And then I just want to make sure I'm understanding your commentary about the 50 basis points worse, which is normal. Are you saying even if we don't get the full typical 3.5% sequential revenue increase, we can still stay with the normal or degradation and it's not worse. Is that the message that you're giving?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think to answer that question first, yes I think that we're going to go with the 50 basis points being the target. And again, keep in mind, just like we said last quarter, it's put a plus or minus around that. I am not being that specific, anything can happen. But I think that our team is continuing to do a great job with managing cost in this lower volume environment, and we will continue to do so as we progress through the third quarter. And so obviously it's a little bit easier if we've got some revenue contribution, we typically have an increase in certain cost elements as we progress through the quarter. We're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. So we will have incremental depreciation dollars in the third quarter versus the second. We have a wage increase that will go out the 1st of September as well as it always does, so you get one month of that. And so we'll continue to monitor and measure operating efficiencies and we've been seeing some improvements there and have some other offsets as well. Continue to manage every discretionary dollar that's going out the door in managing to the business levels that we're seeing. So we'll continue to do all those things, but certainly hope that we'll see a little bit of incremental revenue improvement and that will make things easier, obviously, but we're going to continue to manage and have that hanging out there as our goal to achieve.\nScott Group: And then any just quick thoughts, record buyback in the quarter, is this this a change in sort of capital returns? Is this a new sort of run rate to think about going forward?\nAdam Satterfield: No, it's no change. I think it's similar. It was a record level, as you say, but you go back a couple of years ago and when our stock performed similar to the big drop that we saw during the second quarter, if you go back to 2022, we spent $1.3 billion in total that year, so had some pretty hefty quarters that was just spread more through the year. But our stock was off 20% to 25% from 52-week highs going back to the last quarter's phone call and earnings call and so as we've done in the past, we stepped in and were more aggressive with our repurchases. Now the stock price has recovered a bit and so be going back more so to kind of our normalized grid based approach to repurchasing shares. But we just stepped in a little bit more aggressively with the cash that we had on the balance sheet and purchased more during that second quarter, including an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well, and which we still got a little bit of about $40 million that was deferred on that agreement, that should settle sometime late third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: The next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This is probably the first up cycle in a while, maybe ever, where it's not just you who has the excess capacity, but a lot of your peers do as well. I think you kind of alluded to that in your prepared remarks as well. Do you get a sense that their approach to having this excess capacity and dealing with the drag on incremental margins is similar to your own or do you feel that they may be going to looking to deploy that capacity a little bit earlier than you guys?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I can't answer for what they're going to do with any measure of any excess capacity any individual carrier has, but with respect to just looking at the industry broadly, I feel like that we're going to be a more capacity constrained industry than we were previously. If you go back, we estimate that shipping volumes are down about 15% from the peak back in 2021. And when you look at the number of service centers that have settled from that bankruptcy proceeding, not all are in operation yet, but probably at least 10% and maybe more capacity will be coming out of the market. So, all those shipments that were being picked up and delivered by that carrier they are LTL shipments. They will come back to the market and our market will recover to the levels where it was previously and I believe will continue to increase further. So that's why we continue to believe and continue to invest ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We don't see anything that has changed with the opportunities that we have for long-term market share opportunities other than perhaps maybe they've gotten stronger. As more shippers look for high quality service carriers, inventory management continues to be an operating focus, especially in a higher interest rate environment, I think it puts the burden on shippers to select high quality carriers and there's none better than old Dominion. So we look at the market generally and believe we've got as strong an opportunity that we've ever had and we think we're better positioned than any other carrier to capitalize on and improve in the industry.\nRavi Shanker: Understood, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Thomas Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nThomas Wadewitz: Yes, good morning. So, Adam, I wanted to see if you could give us, I apologize if I missed this, but I think just like the July tonnage and shipments, I think you talked about revenue terms but not the tonnage and shipments. I don't know if you want to give us like normal seasonality, July versus June or year-over-year, but some kind of framework for thinking about shipments and tonnage in July.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. The breakdown, if you will, of the revenue, it's definitely in flux. I mean, like I mentioned, we were in the first part of this month, we were growing at a similar rate from a revenue per day standpoint is where we were for the second quarter and kind of that 6% range. And obviously the comps have changed pretty considerably, mainly starting this week in particular. And so it's going to cause a little disruption to what the tonnage numbers look, what we're seeing today, we can extrapolate out and we do where we think we'll finish. But I think there's going to be a little flux with respect to what those final volume numbers and yield numbers might look like given the drastic change in business levels and mix that we saw in that last part of the month of July. But at this point, I would say that that in that 4% to 4.5%, I would say that the volumes are probably about flattish and that could be plus or minus, one way around that and that flatness. And then from a yield standpoint, again pretty consistent with what we just saw in the second quarter. And right now it's looking a little bit stronger, but we'll see where those final numbers land and of course we'll put the final details out there. But just from a pure revenue standpoint, though, and just looking at revenue per day, July and October are the months that we see decreases in as we go month-to-month and progress through the year. And what we're seeing from a pure revenue per day standpoint is it's pretty consistent with what normal seasonality would otherwise be, which is a drop off somewhere in kind of the 2.5% type of range and that's pretty consistent with what our five year average has been there. So we'll look to see that we get some recovery back in August, which is normal and then September, as you know, is pretty much our strongest month of the year. So can we see stronger acceleration going into the end of the quarter? I would hope so. We saw strong performance in March, strong performance in June, and if that can repeat, we'll see where we land. But that's kind of the lay of the land and what things are looking like at the moment. And of course, we'll update, as I mentioned earlier, with the final July and then the mid quarter update with our August trends.\nThomas Wadewitz: Okay, yes thank you for that. Just one other quick one on headcount, how are you thinking about headcount sequentially? Are you in kind of a flattish volume environment? Are we modeling headcount down a little bit sequentially or are you kind of keeping it flat and keeping some capacity for when the volume improves?\nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think we're in a good spot from an overall headcount standpoint. At the end of June, we're 150 to 200 people ahead of where we were in September of last year when we were handling 51,000 shipments per day, so we're in a good spot there. It drifted down just normal attrition kind of taking place through the second quarter. And if that continues to occur as we go through the second half of the year, we're always balancing the changes and so forth, generally in alignment with what our shipment counts are and how they're changing. So it'd be something that we continue to watch and deal with. But at this point we're getting closer to where you generally have the seasonally slower parts of the year once we get into 4Q and 1Q, but we're keeping our eye out for what 2025 might look like and you don't wait until it's coming at you. You've got to get ahead of the curve, if you will and that's why this year we invested so much, and we always are investing in our people and restarted our truck driving schools and so forth and it continued to increase the number of employees with their CDLs to be ready for when our customers call on us and they need capacity, we want to be in a position to be able to respond with a yes, we can help you versus trying to play catch-up and be reactive.\nThomas Wadewitz: Great. Thank you for the time.\nOperator:\nJon Chappell:\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good morning. Adam, you know as well as anybody the bear thesis about capacity coming online, whether it's the terminals that were auctioned or the organic growth by some of your peers and what that may be the pricing, sounds like early stages of 3Q pricing has been relatively consistent, but as we think about the anniversarying, the Yellow bankruptcy starting in 4Q most especially from a yield perspective, is there any reason why you wouldn't see typical seasonal trends in yield beyond this summer, whether that relates to capacity or any other factors in the market?\nAdam Satterfield: Like I said earlier, maybe to just elaborate on that, but we're continuing to see good yield performance and that's what we expect. I mean this is something that we work on day by day. Our sales team and our pricing and costing teams are all working together and working with our customers to ultimately provide value to their supply chains. But our yield management philosophy is to attain increases that not necessarily are market driven in a sense of the markets in our favor or not. It's what's our cost inflation looking like? And then what are the continuing needs of our business. And that's been a long-term philosophy that is consistent and has worked for us and so that's what we would continue to expect as we move forward as well. We're negotiating and working every day and would expect that as any contracts are coming due, that we will work through and need to obtain increases on those, so regardless of what other carriers and specific issues or areas or whatnot may be going on, we expect that we'll continue to see a disciplined environment in the industry and that's what we've seen thus far. So we'll just continue to manage through that and keep sort of focusing on what we do and what we can deliver and continue to add value to our customer supply chains.\nJonathan Chappell: Okay. Thank you, Adam.\nOperator: The next question is from Eric Morgan with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask one on cost inflation. Your comp per employee has been up maybe mid-single digits or so for about a year now. Just wondering, as you think about another wage increase later this quarter and as broader inflation measures are trending down a little bit, should we start to see that moderate and maybe how does that factor into the sequential OR outlook for 3Q? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Well, generally speaking, when you look over the longer term, when you look at our cost per shipment, if you will, wage cost per shipment, it's generally going up about 3% to 3.5% and more in line with what the wage increase that we give every year has been. There's been inflation that we've seen in our benefit cost, and we experienced some of that as well in the second quarter. And those fringe benefit costs include multiple factors, some of which are improvements to the overall comp program that we offer to employees and things like paid time off benefits that we've improved over the years and the quality of our group health and dental programs as well. So, I mean, those are incremental changes that we're always having to manage. And maybe there's a little bit more variability in terms of when you're self-insured on the health program, you can have changes in one quarter versus the next that aren\u2019t necessarily going in alignment with what shipment volumes may be changing. But looking over time, that's just something that we would expect will continue to change and reflect the improvements. In terms of the benefit program and comp program that we offer employees. But 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits, so that's generally been the biggest driver of our total cost for shipment inflation. That's averaged 3.5% to 4% over the long-term as well, so that all goes into it. We've had a lot of other incremental inflationary items, things like the cost of our equipment, maintenance costs that have been up double digits on a per mile basis the last few years, insurance costs that is a problem for the industry, that have been up double digits for multiple years in a row. All of those things we contend with and that's why there's got to be an ongoing focus on operating efficiency and discretionary spending, and we're managing our costs day by day in good times and bad. If you wait until it's too late, if you wait until they're bad times, you got to have that focus going every day or you may not even know where to start. So that's something that we're always looking at. How can we offset all those other costs to basically keep our cost inflation in check and then, as you know, the yield management philosophy is we try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread over top of that cost inflation metric. So that keeps our pricing levels in check with the rest of the industry as well. So it all kind of goes into it, but it's a day by day fight to try to keep our cost inflation minimized as best as we can.\nEric Morgan: I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Adam, it's encouraging to hear that some signs of seasonality have stuck with you through July so far and I appreciate the framing of typical 3Q seasonality on both the top line and the margin side. Can we look ahead to 4Q without necessarily blessing whether the market suggests we'll be above or below, but how do you frame seasonality for your business into 4Q both on top line and a margin basis, looking back historically as we try to level set our views? Thank you.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, so as I've said a couple of times, the fourth quarter and the first quarter are seasonally slower periods, if you will. The fourth quarter, from just a pure revenue per day standpoint, it's just a slight drop off. And then you go into the first quarter and revenue is down, maybe down in the fourth quarter 0.5% sequentially versus the third quarter, and then you drop on average about 1.5% going into the first quarter. From an operating ratio standpoint, the fourth quarter is typically about 200 to 250 basis points higher than the third. And a lot of that is the revenue level softening a little bit. We've got three months of that wage increase. And that normal change, if you remember from last year, we always have actuarial assessment of our insurance reserves in the fourth quarter and those adjustments can go one way or the other and I generally view those as a reconciling item to whatever that normal change is. And last year was an unfavorable adjustment to that insurance and claims line. A few years prior they had been favorable adjustments. So kind of throw that out of the window when just looking at what is that normal cost progression change.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great, thanks and good morning. I guess maybe I need to check numbers a little bit. I think we've got a 10-year average in second quarter or to third quarter of a 10 basis point improvement, not a 50 basis point decrease, so I just wanted to double check that. And then as you start to lap the Yellow freight data, last year you went from down upper teens on revenue per day and mid-teens tons per day to kind of much smaller losses. I guess given that backdrop, how should we think about the market kind of tonnage per day growth? I know you've talked a lot about revenue per day, but how do we think about the tons per day shift as we move into the third or into the back half of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter?\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, and I'll come back to that. Let me just address the second quarter to third quarter change. You're right, the pure math is more about a 10 basis point change, but there are a couple of years in there that skew that. In 2023 last year obviously we had a major acceleration in revenue that allowed us to improve the operating ratio 170 basis points from 2Q to 3Q and then 2020 was similar where you had the COVID cliff that happened and then the reacceleration of business levels. So when I just look at more of a normalized kind of progression, that's typically what we'd expect, unless you've got something unusual going on that would drive some change there. With respect to the tonnage question and shipments, obviously as you said, we had the acceleration that was meaningfully happening last year. If you recall, we were at 47,000 shipments per day, really from December of 2022 through July of 2023, and immediately stepped up to about 50,000 in August and then accelerated further to 51,000 in September. So, step function change that would be well above anything that was really happening with the underlying economy, if you will. So, if we can see some type of normal acceleration, if you will, just like from a tonnage standpoint, our 10-year average from July to August is six tenths of a percent increase there and then about a 3.5% increase in September. So we'll see how that goes. But right now, even if we hit those, it would look like you would have a negative change in those volumes. But overall, I think it's just as we look at things sequentially, maybe more so than just a year-over-year, given that challenge is what can we achieve relative to what normal seasonality would be and what we've seen at least so far through July. From a tons per day standpoint, just from a pure quarter, we're typically up about 1% when we gave the numbers earlier, but in the second quarter, that average is just call it 6% and we were up 3% just sort of rounding numbers. So we were up kind of half of what normal seasonality would suggest. So we've got to make up some ground. Like I said earlier, we always lose a little bit of business in July, and that's normal. And so if we can have kind of a little bit of acceleration through August and then see some acceleration into September, we were almost at normal seasonality in the June period. And the same thing with March, you've got to adjust for the Good Friday, but we're about at seasonality in those stronger growth months of the quarter. So if we can make some progress in August and then see some sense of that strong acceleration through the month of September, I think we'll be okay. And we've position ourselves well, whenever we come out of this true economic downturn, where we're operating at a 72, essentially, and 71.9 [ph] I guess I should take credit for every basis point we have in terms of where we've operated. And when I look at the breakdown of our operating ratio in the quarter and where we are from an overhead standpoint relative to our direct variable costs, I'm really pleased with the improvement that we've made with our direct cost performance. And that just gets into the day-to-day management within our operations in the field, primarily. But everyone is contributing to that overall operating ratio. But our overhead costs have increased. They were 20% to 21% of revenue in the most recent quarter. Those costs have been down to around 17% in the past. So once we get some true density coming back into the network, we've built our network and our system to accommodate more than 50,000 shipments a day. So once we get back into 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, whatever that number is, that's where you'll really see the power of operating density in the model. And you move that scale from 20% to 21% back towards 17% that puts us back in with an overall with the 6 handle on it, back where we were in 2022. So I think we're in a great spot and have managed through this downturn very well and has certainly put ourselves in a great position to capitalize on the market when we actually start seeing some economic wins at our back.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks for the time, Adam. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, Adam, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on what end markets or maybe customers are seeing some of that strength at the end of the last two quarters in March and June. Is there anything to read into that? Does it give you any sort of forward looking to the back half of the year or next year? And then just kind of another follow up on competition and extra capacity coming online are you seeing anything as these new facilities come back online, anything that you would call out from either service being disrupted by some of your competitors or are they being a little bit more aggressive to maybe fill some of those doors and pricing more to capacity and not necessarily cost?\nMarty Freeman: Good morning, this is Marty. I'm going to answer your customer question. I'm still heavily involved with a lot of our top customers and the feeling out there is not all doom and gloom. In fact, our top 50 customers are up mid-single digits year-to-date. So we're getting a lot of positive remarks, especially from our larger customers and they as well see some positive things for the rest of the year. So we're very positive of and that those things will continue. And as Adam said earlier, they feel, and I feel if we can see some interest rate drops toward the end of the year, I think we'll really accelerate. So we're looking forward to that and prepared to handle it. So it's not all doom and gloom out there, trust me.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes. And on the competitive side, we've not seen, I don't think, any material change in the sense of, if someone has opened one service center in whatever market, any type of real impact. And as you can see in our yield trends, things continue to be consistent with our performance. That's just something we'll continue to manage through and monitor. But given the cost that went into purchasing many of these facilities, we'd be a little surprised to see someone going out and having to be aggressive to try to fill it up. And at the end of the day, those service centers served the market for a reason. They were in existence. And those particular markets had a customer base that their sales rep called on and there are LTL shipments that are out there. And as I referenced earlier, I mean, the market is down overall and we estimate that it's down about 15% from back from in 2021, but that's something that will recover. Those LTL shipments, those customers will continue to have freight that needs to be moved through an LTL network. And I think that will end up creating opportunity for us, for the industry in general, to refill those facilities, if you will, once they come online. But to me, it creates maybe even more of an opportunity for Old Dominion specifically.\nMarty Freeman: I agree with that. There are still over 130 facilities that haven't been sold. So that's actually less capacity when things pick up than we had when YRC was still in business.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Okay, thanks very much, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on some of your network investments and maybe some of the terminals that have been opened so far this year. So may be if you could give us an update on the new terminal openings or door additions year-to-date thus far? And then an update in terms of your plans for maybe the back half of this year, if there's been any kind of maybe postponement or pause, just given the state of the underlying macro, any color there would be helpful? Thanks.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, we've opened three service centers this year and we're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. The current estimate is to spend about $350 million this year, at least on the real estate component of that program. So our plan is we look at the network. We look at the service centers that we feel like need some measure of capacity. And when we look kind of over the next five years, and what the anticipated growth curve may be and the efficiency of the network comes into play as well, the location of where these facilities are and so that kind of goes into the overall plan. And we're a little bit heavy right now, frankly. It's not unusual when we go through a slower economic environment to get a little ahead of the curve. Our long-term strategy is we like having 20% to 25% excess capacity in the system. We're at about 30% today and that's okay. We're comfortable with that. Now, what that may mean is exactly what you said. There may be facilities that are in process today. We will finish those facilities, and if the demand environment doesn't dictate that we go ahead and open them immediately, we'll finish the construction, we'll start the depreciation and so forth of those facilities. But we'll wait until there's stronger demand to really justify the opening and all the incremental overhead cost that goes along with those facilities once they're operational. Not just the overhead, but there's configurations to the line haul network that has to happen, and generally that negatively impacts load factors. So that's something that these other carriers that are opening multiple facilities will be facing the incremental cost there, which is another reason why we don't anticipate seeing reductions in pricing or any pressures there. But so that's something that just goes into it and we'll continue to look and evaluate, but overall continuing to plan and we'll continue to -- the investments that we make are really just based on what we think the market share opportunities are in each of the respective areas. And so we feel like we've got tremendous opportunity ahead and thus we intend to continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenue revenues every year on total capital expenditures, the real estate, and then obviously on the fleet and the technology side as well to keep pace with our anticipated growth.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBruce Chan: Hey, good morning everyone. Adam I wanted to followup on the seasonality and the macro comments or certainly Marty, given your discussion with customers. But obviously there's a lot of moving parts this year with the geopolitical situation and with the election. There has been some talk on the 3PL side about volume pull forward. So maybe just wondering if you've gotten any indication from customers to that effect or if you think the demand and seasonality conversations seem to be pretty clear right now. Thank you.\nMarty Freeman: Yes. As I said before, about a third of our business is 3PL related and those are basically the top customers that I was referring to. And most of those that come in here are giving us new opportunities to go in with them and handle their business and for the most part, they're super positive. We have a set of 3PLs in here this morning that I've already talked to, and they're super positive and they've got growth opportunities. So, I'm positive as well that we'll see some positive results from these customers and hopefully next year in the geopolitical environment, if we see some change there, I think it will be even more positive. Adam?\nAdam Satterfield: No, I don't really have anything to add. I think that obviously, anytime there's an election year that creates uncertainty and usually puts pressure on the overall shipping environment, and we've seen that this year on top of a slower industrial economy in general. So, I think that's something that will just be one more measure of uncertainty that will soon be put to bed, whatever direction it goes. But I think just broadly speaking, if we start having clarity on some of the macro factors that are impacting business owners and the decisions that they make about expanding their businesses and so forth, and we can make changes from an interest rate environment that helps and helps people and the consumer. We're still a consumer driven economy and so that's so that's something that if we can keep a healthy consumer out there, they're buying things, that creates inventory that's got to be replenished. That's the customer call that comes into OD for a shipment to be picked up, so that will be the opportunity created. So it's something that we'll continue to measure and monitor and so forth. But as Marty mentioned, we're seeing improved performance with our 3PL customers right now. We had a little bit stronger retail related performance in the second quarter. Industrial was okay, but kind of reflects the industrial environment, like the ISM metrics that we talked about earlier. So, but all of that, it's called a cycle for a reason. And it's easy to get called up when you're in the down part of the cycle. We've managed through that. We've been in the down part of the cycle for a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, but it will turn back to the positive at some point and we're in a great position to capitalize when it does.\nBruce Chan: Yes, thanks for that.\nOperator: The next question is from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hey, Marty, hey Adam. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I just wanted to follow up, Marty, to some of your comments. You mentioned that you've been talking to a lot of your big customers and it's not all doom and gloom. I was wondering sort of what areas those customers just spread across the board is this more consumer versus industrial? And the other one would be, we've heard a lot about some business being pulled forward from peak season into the 2Q and I guess the startup 3Q here. I'm wondering if you guys have seen any impacts from that and how should we look at that going forward?\nMarty Freeman: Well, it's all over the board from a product or commodity standpoint. As you see on the news daily, your hospitality and your travel markets are the ones that's really up over the industrial sector. But the commodities and opportunities that we have from these 3PLs and other customers, it's just all over the board. Inventories are all over the board. You hear from some that say, we still have a little inventory from last year and others say our inventory is getting low. So we're going to start ordering product, whether that be domestically or overseas. It's just all over the board. But like I said earlier, I'm still, I'm very positive that things have basically bottomed out and I'm looking forward to better times.\nJason Seidl: Okay. In terms of the pull forward, have you seen any impact?\nAdam Satterfield: We've not really heard any material discussion of any pull forward or whatnot at this point or at least I've not heard anyone, anyone from our sales team or any customer that we've had here in the office that's really spoken to that.\nMarty Freeman: Yes, me either.\nJason Seidl: Okay, perfect. Gentlemen, I appreciate the time as always.\nAdam Satterfield: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: And the final question today is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and thanks for squeezing me in at last here. Marty, bigger picture thought question, and I'm just curious, your view. If I look at the ATA/LTL tonnage index, it's down about 8%. And a year ago, before Yellow, the volumes of the publicly traded LTL carriers were tracking more closely to that. Since Yellow happened, the publicly traded group is showing kind of flat to up 2% tonnage, but the ATA tonnage index is still showing down about 8%. Is there something going on? Why would it diverge so much? And is there something going on maybe where the smaller LTL carriers might be struggling a little bit more than you and some of your larger peers? Can you help me kind of bridge this gap?\nMarty Freeman: Well, I think probably what you saw when YRC went out of business is that, customers were struggling to find ways to move that freight. And some of it went, and not a large portion of it, but some of it went to your smaller freight forwarders, airfreight forwarders, smaller logistic companies and I think that's where some of that has gone. And those guys basically don't have any assets, so they're handling it at a lower rate. And I think some of that business moved to full truckload carriers as the economy started to slow. And as I've said before, when your economy starts to pick back up your -- the LTL industry will benefit from that, even from the full truckload industry because we saw some of that freight move to those full truckload carriers as it relates to stop offs. And once those full truckload carriers begin to get busier and their capacity gets tighter, that freight will move back toward the LTL industry. So I think that type, the business moved a little bit everywhere based on price and so that's how I see it. That's the only way I can explain it.\nJeff Kauffman: So the bigger point I'm going for here is, as you mentioned earlier, you got the PMI down in negative territory. Right now, industrial production is kind of flattish. You're 50%, 60% industrial. When we look at your tonnage growth of 2% and you're nothing chasing any Yellow business, the industry is probably a lot weaker in aggregate than what the five or six publicly traded truckload companies are reporting, that that 2% tonnage growth actually is stronger than the industry appears to be if we look at it through a broader lens, and not just the lens of the publicly traded guys.\nAdam Satterfield: Yes, like you said, I mean, it's hard to know as we don't have access to all the private carriers, if you will. But we think some of that business may have gone there. But I think everyone's just been facing the challenge of the slower economy and so that business, it's hard to trace through. When Yellow did 50,000 shipments per day and you just look at, I did the comparison of looking at second quarter 2023 numbers and most recently compared them to the first quarter of 2024 for at least the publicly traded carriers, which are 65% to 70% of the industry's revenue. But trying to trace through and figure out where all those shipments went and how they're being handled and in what mode are they being handled by is a tough task. But the thing that we take away and what I mentioned earlier is if economically it made sense for those shippers to move their freight within the LTL environment, sharing the cost, leveraging an LTL carriers network, sharing the cost on smaller shipment sizes with other shippers within the environment, all the benefits of moving freight by LTL that exist, which creates, we think, long term opportunity for our industry. Those shipments are going to return and they will be there and available again and so that's why we continue to believe that our industry will be increasing. We'll get back to the levels where we were in 2021 and I believe we'll grow further beyond there and we're in an environment that I think we'll end up with, who knows what the final capacity number will be. But at this point it looks like total industry capacity could be down 10% or maybe even more from where we were at that 2021 period. So you've got more volumes and less capacity overall that exist. And there may still be a little bit of shuffling around with those shipments and ultimately finding a home. Once the market tightens up and everyone gets really busy again, I think that's when you'll see who's really got the best long-term strategy. Who has got the best service, the best value, network capacity, people capacity, equipment capacity. I think when you look at all those factors and who delivers the best value I think the answer is clearly Old Dominion. And so that's why we're excited about what our long-term opportunities are and I think that we will continue to win market share and ultimately create incremental shareholder value.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you for your insight.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks.\nMarty Freeman: Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further and I hope you have a good day and a good rest of your summer. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Adam Satterfield",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the second quarter of 2024 of $1.5 billion was a 6.1% increase from the prior year. The increase in revenue was due to a 4.4% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight and a 1.9% increase in LTL tons per day. Our operating ratio improved to 71.9%, which contributed to the 11.3% increase in earnings per diluted share to $1.48 for the core. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the second quarter increased 2.6% when compared to the first quarter of 2024 with LTL tons per day increasing 3.3% and LTL shipments per day increasing 3.2%. For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes an increase of 8.7% in revenue per day, an increase of 5.8% in tons per day, and an increase of 6.5% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the second quarter were as follows. April increased 0.4% as compared to March, May increased 0.1% as compared to April, and June increased 1.9% as compared to May. The 10-year average change for these respective months is a decrease of 0.4% in April, an increase of 2.7% in May and an increase of 2.3% in June. I would like to note, however, that in years when Good Friday occurs in March, as it did this year, the average sequential change in LTL tons per day from March to April is a 2.6% increase. For July, we expect our revenue per day will increase by approximately 4% to 4.5% when compared to July of 2023 assuming the remaining days of the month follow normal historical trends. The growth rate in our revenue per day through the first half of July was relatively consistent with the second quarter. The comparisons have now become a little more difficult, however; as the final week of July last year was when we began to see freight diversion from a large competitor that ultimately filed for bankruptcy. We will provide the actual revenue related details for July and our second quarter. Form 10-Q. Our operating ratio improved 40 basis points to 71.9% for the second quarter of 2024 due primarily to the quality of our revenue growth and continued focus on operating efficiencies. Our team continued to do a great job of managing our direct variable costs during the second quarter, which allowed us to improve these costs as a percent of revenue. Our overhead costs, however, continued to increase as a percent of revenue despite our best efforts to minimize discretionary spending. As we have often said before, the two main ingredients to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment. While we continue to execute on our yield management initiatives, it will likely take an improvement in the domestic economy before we see sustained momentum in shipping demand that generally leads to incremental market share opportunities and operating density. We remain confident that once we have both of these elements working again in our favor, our team can produce further improvement in our operating ratio and make progress towards our goal of achieving a sub-70 annual OR. Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $387.8 million and $811.7 million for the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while capital expenditures were $238.1 million and $357.6 million for those same periods. We utilized $551.8 million and $637.1 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the second quarter and first half of 2024, respectively, while cash dividends totaled $56.0 million and $112.6 million for the same periods. This year-to-date total for share repurchases includes $40 million that is deferred until the final settlement occurs on our current accelerated share repurchase agreement, which would be no later than November of 2024. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2024 was 24.5%, which was lower than originally expected due to the benefit of certain discrete tax items. The effective tax rate for the second quarter 2023 was 25.4%. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25% for the third quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning. Operator we'll be happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Yes, sir. Unfortunately, we're still dealing with an economy that's not contributing too much to us right now with 55% to 60% of our revenue being industrial related. The ISM continues to be below 50, and I think that's 19 out of the past 20 months. So it's hard to say what will happen from a top line basis and as you know, the revenue will dictate a lot of the performance, at least when we go sequentially. But I feel like some things have -- there have been some bright spots to look at in terms of the trend that we saw through June and so far this month in July, from a revenue and a volume standpoint. So we'll see how that continues to play out as we progress through the quarter and as we always do we will give our mid quarter update with the august performance once that is finished. But based on kind of where we are today, normal seasonality is typically about a 50 basis point increase sequentially from the second to the third quarter, and I think that's achievable. It's certainly what the goal would be, and I think that regardless of which way the revenue goes, if we stay kind of flattish like we've seen from a quarter-to-quarter standpoint, typically the average sequential change in revenue is about a 3.5% increase from the second to the third quarter. So wherever we fall along that spectrum from a top line basis, I still think that something along the lines of that 50 basis point sequential increase plus or minus of course, we generally give ourselves kind of plus or minus 20 basis points. But I think that's something that's certainly very achievable for the third quarter. Well, I think it's still tough to tell. I mean, I feel like things are starting to thaw a little bit. Again, I felt like we had a good performance through June. We finally had some, some good sequential increase there from a volume standpoint. And so a little bit of acceleration and somewhat similar to what we had in the final month of the first quarter with March there, but a nice increase from the May to June period. So it's something that we'll continue to watch. We've got the third quarter here, and then we typically go through the seasonally slower fourth quarter and first quarter. But hopefully some things are building. I think when you look at some of the macroeconomic factors would suggest that maybe some of the things that the Fed would watch would indicate that we may be closer to the interest rate environment may be improving a little bit and seeing some cuts out there that would certainly help from a business standpoint. So it seems like we're coming close to the end of a long, slow cycle, and we'll just have to continue to watch and see what's presented to us. But it certainly feels like we're seeing a little bit more opportunity out there than what we have been seeing. Yes, I think what we've seen is just a continuation of executing on our long-term yield management philosophy, and we continue to target increases that offset our cost inflation and support the continued investment in capacity and technologies that our customers expect from us. And our yield trend in June and what we're seeing thus far in July is pretty similar from a year-over-year standpoint. If you just sort of look at normal seasonality and revenue per hundredweight, at least excluding fuel, normal sequential would imply that for the full quarter it would be up 4% to 4.5%, that metric, and some of that will be some mix change that we'll go through more so in August and September. If you think last year, following the disruption to the industry, our weight for shipment decreased quite a bit as we moved through August and September last year. Overall for the third quarter of 2023, it was down about 30 pounds versus the second quarter of 2023. So had that reduction in weight for shipment, and I would like to see that at least our weight per shipment has been stable. If that continues to increase further and a reflection, if there is any improvement in the economy, then that just becomes more challenging from a mix standpoint. But so far, what we've seen in July is pretty consistent with where we were in the second quarter, in June in particular. So we'll continue to see how that plays out. Yes, no real change in July, still kind of continuing to bounce around that 1500 pounds mark. And to me I think that's what we've seen. Obviously we saw the unique change that happened last year right at the end of July going into August. And that took our weight down quite a bit like I just mentioned. But it just feels like we've been bouncing along the bottom and I think that's an indicator really where the industrial economy has been as well. So I think that should be one of the first signs and early indicators. If we start seeing some incremental weight on each shipment that we're picking up, that orders might be picking up and that would obviously be good for a lot of measurements. If we can get more weight per shipment, generally that's going to lead to the improvement in operating efficiencies and generally that leads into improved volumes in general if the underlying economy truly is improving. So all things that we are very prepared for in terms of the capacity in our service center network, the capacity of our people and our fleet, we are primed and in position to respond whenever the market does. In fact inflect to the positive. Yes, I think to answer that question first, yes I think that we're going to go with the 50 basis points being the target. And again, keep in mind, just like we said last quarter, it's put a plus or minus around that. I am not being that specific, anything can happen. But I think that our team is continuing to do a great job with managing cost in this lower volume environment, and we will continue to do so as we progress through the third quarter. And so obviously it's a little bit easier if we've got some revenue contribution, we typically have an increase in certain cost elements as we progress through the quarter. We're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. So we will have incremental depreciation dollars in the third quarter versus the second. We have a wage increase that will go out the 1st of September as well as it always does, so you get one month of that. And so we'll continue to monitor and measure operating efficiencies and we've been seeing some improvements there and have some other offsets as well. Continue to manage every discretionary dollar that's going out the door in managing to the business levels that we're seeing. So we'll continue to do all those things, but certainly hope that we'll see a little bit of incremental revenue improvement and that will make things easier, obviously, but we're going to continue to manage and have that hanging out there as our goal to achieve. No, it's no change. I think it's similar. It was a record level, as you say, but you go back a couple of years ago and when our stock performed similar to the big drop that we saw during the second quarter, if you go back to 2022, we spent $1.3 billion in total that year, so had some pretty hefty quarters that was just spread more through the year. But our stock was off 20% to 25% from 52-week highs going back to the last quarter's phone call and earnings call and so as we've done in the past, we stepped in and were more aggressive with our repurchases. Now the stock price has recovered a bit and so be going back more so to kind of our normalized grid based approach to repurchasing shares. But we just stepped in a little bit more aggressively with the cash that we had on the balance sheet and purchased more during that second quarter, including an accelerated share repurchase agreement as well, and which we still got a little bit of about $40 million that was deferred on that agreement, that should settle sometime late third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. Yes, I can't answer for what they're going to do with any measure of any excess capacity any individual carrier has, but with respect to just looking at the industry broadly, I feel like that we're going to be a more capacity constrained industry than we were previously. If you go back, we estimate that shipping volumes are down about 15% from the peak back in 2021. And when you look at the number of service centers that have settled from that bankruptcy proceeding, not all are in operation yet, but probably at least 10% and maybe more capacity will be coming out of the market. So, all those shipments that were being picked up and delivered by that carrier they are LTL shipments. They will come back to the market and our market will recover to the levels where it was previously and I believe will continue to increase further. So that's why we continue to believe and continue to invest ahead of our anticipated growth curve. We don't see anything that has changed with the opportunities that we have for long-term market share opportunities other than perhaps maybe they've gotten stronger. As more shippers look for high quality service carriers, inventory management continues to be an operating focus, especially in a higher interest rate environment, I think it puts the burden on shippers to select high quality carriers and there's none better than old Dominion. So we look at the market generally and believe we've got as strong an opportunity that we've ever had and we think we're better positioned than any other carrier to capitalize on and improve in the industry. Yes. The breakdown, if you will, of the revenue, it's definitely in flux. I mean, like I mentioned, we were in the first part of this month, we were growing at a similar rate from a revenue per day standpoint is where we were for the second quarter and kind of that 6% range. And obviously the comps have changed pretty considerably, mainly starting this week in particular. And so it's going to cause a little disruption to what the tonnage numbers look, what we're seeing today, we can extrapolate out and we do where we think we'll finish. But I think there's going to be a little flux with respect to what those final volume numbers and yield numbers might look like given the drastic change in business levels and mix that we saw in that last part of the month of July. But at this point, I would say that that in that 4% to 4.5%, I would say that the volumes are probably about flattish and that could be plus or minus, one way around that and that flatness. And then from a yield standpoint, again pretty consistent with what we just saw in the second quarter. And right now it's looking a little bit stronger, but we'll see where those final numbers land and of course we'll put the final details out there. But just from a pure revenue standpoint, though, and just looking at revenue per day, July and October are the months that we see decreases in as we go month-to-month and progress through the year. And what we're seeing from a pure revenue per day standpoint is it's pretty consistent with what normal seasonality would otherwise be, which is a drop off somewhere in kind of the 2.5% type of range and that's pretty consistent with what our five year average has been there. So we'll look to see that we get some recovery back in August, which is normal and then September, as you know, is pretty much our strongest month of the year. So can we see stronger acceleration going into the end of the quarter? I would hope so. We saw strong performance in March, strong performance in June, and if that can repeat, we'll see where we land. But that's kind of the lay of the land and what things are looking like at the moment. And of course, we'll update, as I mentioned earlier, with the final July and then the mid quarter update with our August trends. Well, I think we're in a good spot from an overall headcount standpoint. At the end of June, we're 150 to 200 people ahead of where we were in September of last year when we were handling 51,000 shipments per day, so we're in a good spot there. It drifted down just normal attrition kind of taking place through the second quarter. And if that continues to occur as we go through the second half of the year, we're always balancing the changes and so forth, generally in alignment with what our shipment counts are and how they're changing. So it'd be something that we continue to watch and deal with. But at this point we're getting closer to where you generally have the seasonally slower parts of the year once we get into 4Q and 1Q, but we're keeping our eye out for what 2025 might look like and you don't wait until it's coming at you. You've got to get ahead of the curve, if you will and that's why this year we invested so much, and we always are investing in our people and restarted our truck driving schools and so forth and it continued to increase the number of employees with their CDLs to be ready for when our customers call on us and they need capacity, we want to be in a position to be able to respond with a yes, we can help you versus trying to play catch-up and be reactive. Like I said earlier, maybe to just elaborate on that, but we're continuing to see good yield performance and that's what we expect. I mean this is something that we work on day by day. Our sales team and our pricing and costing teams are all working together and working with our customers to ultimately provide value to their supply chains. But our yield management philosophy is to attain increases that not necessarily are market driven in a sense of the markets in our favor or not. It's what's our cost inflation looking like? And then what are the continuing needs of our business. And that's been a long-term philosophy that is consistent and has worked for us and so that's what we would continue to expect as we move forward as well. We're negotiating and working every day and would expect that as any contracts are coming due, that we will work through and need to obtain increases on those, so regardless of what other carriers and specific issues or areas or whatnot may be going on, we expect that we'll continue to see a disciplined environment in the industry and that's what we've seen thus far. So we'll just continue to manage through that and keep sort of focusing on what we do and what we can deliver and continue to add value to our customer supply chains. Well, generally speaking, when you look over the longer term, when you look at our cost per shipment, if you will, wage cost per shipment, it's generally going up about 3% to 3.5% and more in line with what the wage increase that we give every year has been. There's been inflation that we've seen in our benefit cost, and we experienced some of that as well in the second quarter. And those fringe benefit costs include multiple factors, some of which are improvements to the overall comp program that we offer to employees and things like paid time off benefits that we've improved over the years and the quality of our group health and dental programs as well. So, I mean, those are incremental changes that we're always having to manage. And maybe there's a little bit more variability in terms of when you're self-insured on the health program, you can have changes in one quarter versus the next that aren't necessarily going in alignment with what shipment volumes may be changing. But looking over time, that's just something that we would expect will continue to change and reflect the improvements. In terms of the benefit program and comp program that we offer employees. But 65% of our costs are salaries, wages and benefits, so that's generally been the biggest driver of our total cost for shipment inflation. That's averaged 3.5% to 4% over the long-term as well, so that all goes into it. We've had a lot of other incremental inflationary items, things like the cost of our equipment, maintenance costs that have been up double digits on a per mile basis the last few years, insurance costs that is a problem for the industry, that have been up double digits for multiple years in a row. All of those things we contend with and that's why there's got to be an ongoing focus on operating efficiency and discretionary spending, and we're managing our costs day by day in good times and bad. If you wait until it's too late, if you wait until they're bad times, you got to have that focus going every day or you may not even know where to start. So that's something that we're always looking at. How can we offset all those other costs to basically keep our cost inflation in check and then, as you know, the yield management philosophy is we try to achieve 100 to 150 basis points of positive spread over top of that cost inflation metric. So that keeps our pricing levels in check with the rest of the industry as well. So it all kind of goes into it, but it's a day by day fight to try to keep our cost inflation minimized as best as we can. Yes, so as I've said a couple of times, the fourth quarter and the first quarter are seasonally slower periods, if you will. The fourth quarter, from just a pure revenue per day standpoint, it's just a slight drop off. And then you go into the first quarter and revenue is down, maybe down in the fourth quarter 0.5% sequentially versus the third quarter, and then you drop on average about 1.5% going into the first quarter. From an operating ratio standpoint, the fourth quarter is typically about 200 to 250 basis points higher than the third. And a lot of that is the revenue level softening a little bit. We've got three months of that wage increase. And that normal change, if you remember from last year, we always have actuarial assessment of our insurance reserves in the fourth quarter and those adjustments can go one way or the other and I generally view those as a reconciling item to whatever that normal change is. And last year was an unfavorable adjustment to that insurance and claims line. A few years prior they had been favorable adjustments. So kind of throw that out of the window when just looking at what is that normal cost progression change. Yes, and I'll come back to that. Let me just address the second quarter to third quarter change. You're right, the pure math is more about a 10 basis point change, but there are a couple of years in there that skew that. In 2023 last year obviously we had a major acceleration in revenue that allowed us to improve the operating ratio 170 basis points from 2Q to 3Q and then 2020 was similar where you had the COVID cliff that happened and then the reacceleration of business levels. So when I just look at more of a normalized kind of progression, that's typically what we'd expect, unless you've got something unusual going on that would drive some change there. With respect to the tonnage question and shipments, obviously as you said, we had the acceleration that was meaningfully happening last year. If you recall, we were at 47,000 shipments per day, really from December of 2022 through July of 2023, and immediately stepped up to about 50,000 in August and then accelerated further to 51,000 in September. So, step function change that would be well above anything that was really happening with the underlying economy, if you will. So, if we can see some type of normal acceleration, if you will, just like from a tonnage standpoint, our 10-year average from July to August is six tenths of a percent increase there and then about a 3.5% increase in September. So we'll see how that goes. But right now, even if we hit those, it would look like you would have a negative change in those volumes. But overall, I think it's just as we look at things sequentially, maybe more so than just a year-over-year, given that challenge is what can we achieve relative to what normal seasonality would be and what we've seen at least so far through July. From a tons per day standpoint, just from a pure quarter, we're typically up about 1% when we gave the numbers earlier, but in the second quarter, that average is just call it 6% and we were up 3% just sort of rounding numbers. So we were up kind of half of what normal seasonality would suggest. So we've got to make up some ground. Like I said earlier, we always lose a little bit of business in July, and that's normal. And so if we can have kind of a little bit of acceleration through August and then see some acceleration into September, we were almost at normal seasonality in the June period. And the same thing with March, you've got to adjust for the Good Friday, but we're about at seasonality in those stronger growth months of the quarter. So if we can make some progress in August and then see some sense of that strong acceleration through the month of September, I think we'll be okay. And we've position ourselves well, whenever we come out of this true economic downturn, where we're operating at a 72, essentially, and 71.9 [ph] I guess I should take credit for every basis point we have in terms of where we've operated. And when I look at the breakdown of our operating ratio in the quarter and where we are from an overhead standpoint relative to our direct variable costs, I'm really pleased with the improvement that we've made with our direct cost performance. And that just gets into the day-to-day management within our operations in the field, primarily. But everyone is contributing to that overall operating ratio. But our overhead costs have increased. They were 20% to 21% of revenue in the most recent quarter. Those costs have been down to around 17% in the past. So once we get some true density coming back into the network, we've built our network and our system to accommodate more than 50,000 shipments a day. So once we get back into 50,000, 55,000, 60,000, whatever that number is, that's where you'll really see the power of operating density in the model. And you move that scale from 20% to 21% back towards 17% that puts us back in with an overall with the 6 handle on it, back where we were in 2022. So I think we're in a great spot and have managed through this downturn very well and has certainly put ourselves in a great position to capitalize on the market when we actually start seeing some economic wins at our back. Yes. And on the competitive side, we've not seen, I don't think, any material change in the sense of, if someone has opened one service center in whatever market, any type of real impact. And as you can see in our yield trends, things continue to be consistent with our performance. That's just something we'll continue to manage through and monitor. But given the cost that went into purchasing many of these facilities, we'd be a little surprised to see someone going out and having to be aggressive to try to fill it up. And at the end of the day, those service centers served the market for a reason. They were in existence. And those particular markets had a customer base that their sales rep called on and there are LTL shipments that are out there. And as I referenced earlier, I mean, the market is down overall and we estimate that it's down about 15% from back from in 2021, but that's something that will recover. Those LTL shipments, those customers will continue to have freight that needs to be moved through an LTL network. And I think that will end up creating opportunity for us, for the industry in general, to refill those facilities, if you will, once they come online. But to me, it creates maybe even more of an opportunity for Old Dominion specifically. Yes, we've opened three service centers this year and we're continuing to execute on our CapEx plan. The current estimate is to spend about $350 million this year, at least on the real estate component of that program. So our plan is we look at the network. We look at the service centers that we feel like need some measure of capacity. And when we look kind of over the next five years, and what the anticipated growth curve may be and the efficiency of the network comes into play as well, the location of where these facilities are and so that kind of goes into the overall plan. And we're a little bit heavy right now, frankly. It's not unusual when we go through a slower economic environment to get a little ahead of the curve. Our long-term strategy is we like having 20% to 25% excess capacity in the system. We're at about 30% today and that's okay. We're comfortable with that. Now, what that may mean is exactly what you said. There may be facilities that are in process today. We will finish those facilities, and if the demand environment doesn't dictate that we go ahead and open them immediately, we'll finish the construction, we'll start the depreciation and so forth of those facilities. But we'll wait until there's stronger demand to really justify the opening and all the incremental overhead cost that goes along with those facilities once they're operational. Not just the overhead, but there's configurations to the line haul network that has to happen, and generally that negatively impacts load factors. So that's something that these other carriers that are opening multiple facilities will be facing the incremental cost there, which is another reason why we don't anticipate seeing reductions in pricing or any pressures there. But so that's something that just goes into it and we'll continue to look and evaluate, but overall continuing to plan and we'll continue to -- the investments that we make are really just based on what we think the market share opportunities are in each of the respective areas. And so we feel like we've got tremendous opportunity ahead and thus we intend to continue to spend 10% to 15% of our revenue revenues every year on total capital expenditures, the real estate, and then obviously on the fleet and the technology side as well to keep pace with our anticipated growth. No, I don't really have anything to add. I think that obviously, anytime there's an election year that creates uncertainty and usually puts pressure on the overall shipping environment, and we've seen that this year on top of a slower industrial economy in general. So, I think that's something that will just be one more measure of uncertainty that will soon be put to bed, whatever direction it goes. But I think just broadly speaking, if we start having clarity on some of the macro factors that are impacting business owners and the decisions that they make about expanding their businesses and so forth, and we can make changes from an interest rate environment that helps and helps people and the consumer. We're still a consumer driven economy and so that's so that's something that if we can keep a healthy consumer out there, they're buying things, that creates inventory that's got to be replenished. That's the customer call that comes into OD for a shipment to be picked up, so that will be the opportunity created. So it's something that we'll continue to measure and monitor and so forth. But as Marty mentioned, we're seeing improved performance with our 3PL customers right now. We had a little bit stronger retail related performance in the second quarter. Industrial was okay, but kind of reflects the industrial environment, like the ISM metrics that we talked about earlier. So, but all of that, it's called a cycle for a reason. And it's easy to get called up when you're in the down part of the cycle. We've managed through that. We've been in the down part of the cycle for a lot longer than I had originally anticipated, but it will turn back to the positive at some point and we're in a great position to capitalize when it does. We've not really heard any material discussion of any pull forward or whatnot at this point or at least I've not heard anyone, anyone from our sales team or any customer that we've had here in the office that's really spoken to that. Thanks, Jason. Yes, like you said, I mean, it's hard to know as we don't have access to all the private carriers, if you will. But we think some of that business may have gone there. But I think everyone's just been facing the challenge of the slower economy and so that business, it's hard to trace through. When Yellow did 50,000 shipments per day and you just look at, I did the comparison of looking at second quarter 2023 numbers and most recently compared them to the first quarter of 2024 for at least the publicly traded carriers, which are 65% to 70% of the industry's revenue. But trying to trace through and figure out where all those shipments went and how they're being handled and in what mode are they being handled by is a tough task. But the thing that we take away and what I mentioned earlier is if economically it made sense for those shippers to move their freight within the LTL environment, sharing the cost, leveraging an LTL carriers network, sharing the cost on smaller shipment sizes with other shippers within the environment, all the benefits of moving freight by LTL that exist, which creates, we think, long term opportunity for our industry. Those shipments are going to return and they will be there and available again and so that's why we continue to believe that our industry will be increasing. We'll get back to the levels where we were in 2021 and I believe we'll grow further beyond there and we're in an environment that I think we'll end up with, who knows what the final capacity number will be. But at this point it looks like total industry capacity could be down 10% or maybe even more from where we were at that 2021 period. So you've got more volumes and less capacity overall that exist. And there may still be a little bit of shuffling around with those shipments and ultimately finding a home. Once the market tightens up and everyone gets really busy again, I think that's when you'll see who's really got the best long-term strategy. Who has got the best service, the best value, network capacity, people capacity, equipment capacity. I think when you look at all those factors and who delivers the best value I think the answer is clearly Old Dominion. And so that's why we're excited about what our long-term opportunities are and I think that we will continue to win market share and ultimately create incremental shareholder value."

            "content": "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. After some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's second quarter results represent our third consecutive quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue and earnings per diluted share despite the ongoing sluggish in the domestic economy. These results were made possible by the hard work and dedication of the OD family of employees who continue to execute our long-term strategic plan during the second quarter. I'd like to congratulate our outstanding team for maintaining our commitment to providing superior customer service at a fair price as well as our disciplined approach to managing yield, our laser focus on operating efficiencies and controlling our discretionary spending. Delivering superior service at a fair price is the cornerstone of our business model and our unmatched value proposition has continued to differentiate old Dominion Freight Line from our competition. I'm pleased to report that during the second quarter we once again provided an on time service level of 99% and a cargo claims ratio of 0.1%. Good morning, this is Marty. I'm going to answer your customer question. I'm still heavily involved with a lot of our top customers and the feeling out there is not all doom and gloom. In fact, our top 50 customers are up mid-single digits year-to-date. So we're getting a lot of positive remarks, especially from our larger customers and they as well see some positive things for the rest of the year. So we're very positive of and that those things will continue. And as Adam said earlier, they feel, and I feel if we can see some interest rate drops toward the end of the year, I think we'll really accelerate. So we're looking forward to that and prepared to handle it. So it's not all doom and gloom out there, trust me. I agree with that. There are still over 130 facilities that haven't been sold. So that's actually less capacity when things pick up than we had when YRC was still in business. Yes. As I said before, about a third of our business is 3PL related and those are basically the top customers that I was referring to. And most of those that come in here are giving us new opportunities to go in with them and handle their business and for the most part, they're super positive. We have a set of 3PLs in here this morning that I've already talked to, and they're super positive and they've got growth opportunities. So, I'm positive as well that we'll see some positive results from these customers and hopefully next year in the geopolitical environment, if we see some change there, I think it will be even more positive. Adam? Well, it's all over the board from a product or commodity standpoint. As you see on the news daily, your hospitality and your travel markets are the ones that's really up over the industrial sector. But the commodities and opportunities that we have from these 3PLs and other customers, it's just all over the board. Inventories are all over the board. You hear from some that say, we still have a little inventory from last year and others say our inventory is getting low. So we're going to start ordering product, whether that be domestically or overseas. It's just all over the board. But like I said earlier, I'm still, I'm very positive that things have basically bottomed out and I'm looking forward to better times. Yes, me either. Well, I think probably what you saw when YRC went out of business is that, customers were struggling to find ways to move that freight. And some of it went, and not a large portion of it, but some of it went to your smaller freight forwarders, airfreight forwarders, smaller logistic companies and I think that's where some of that has gone. And those guys basically don't have any assets, so they're handling it at a lower rate. And I think some of that business moved to full truckload carriers as the economy started to slow. And as I've said before, when your economy starts to pick back up your -- the LTL industry will benefit from that, even from the full truckload industry because we saw some of that freight move to those full truckload carriers as it relates to stop offs. And once those full truckload carriers begin to get busier and their capacity gets tighter, that freight will move back toward the LTL industry. So I think that type, the business moved a little bit everywhere based on price and so that's how I see it. That's the only way I can explain it. Thank you all for your participation today. We appreciate your questions and please feel free to give us a call if you have anything further and I hope you have a good day and a good rest of your summer. Thanks."

Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Jack Atkins, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nJack Atkins: Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2024 Conference Call for Old Dominion Freight Line. Today's call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today and through May 1, 2024, by dialing 1 (877) 344-7529, access code 5260631.

As a final note before we begin, we welcome your questions today but ask that you limit yourselves to one question at a time before returning to the queue. Thank you for your cooperation.\n At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Mr. Marty Freeman, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer, for opening remarks. Marty, please go ahead, sir. \nKevin Freeman: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call this morning. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's financial results improved during the first quarter of 2024 despite the continued softness in the domestic economy.\n While the improvement in our results was modest, we produced year-over-year increases in both revenue and earnings per diluted share for the second straight quarter. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.34 also represents a new company record for the first quarter. To produce these results, our OD family of employees continued to execute on long-term strategic plan that helped create one of the strongest records of growth and profitability in the LTL industry.\n This was evidenced by our team's ability to once again deliver 99% on-time service and a 0.1 cargo claims ratio for the first quarter. Consistently delivering superior service at a fair price is the central element of our strategic plan, and we have created a best-in-class value proposition as a result. This value proposition continues to create opportunities for us to win market share over the long term and has also helped strengthen our customer relationships.\n Our customer retention trends have remained steady over the past 2 years despite a domestic economy that has been sluggish for longer than we originally anticipated. Our customers have had fewer shipments to give us as a result of the slower economic environment, but we are strongly positioned to respond to their needs when demand eventually improves.\n Demand can quickly -- can very quickly change in the LTL industry and the OD team has experience in dealing with these challenges that rapid growth can present. This is why we focus so intently on our long-term market share initiatives and make decisions to help us achieve these goals despite the cost implications that may impact us at the short term.\n Our capital expenditure program is a prime example of this, as we have invested $757.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2023 and expect to spend approximately $750 million this year to stay ahead of our growth curve. The resulting depreciation has recreated some short-term cost headwinds that slightly impacted our first quarter operating ratio, but we have improved our fleet and also have approximately 30% excess capacity in our service center network to support future growth.\n The LTL industry has seen significant disruption over the past 9 months, but we believe the strategic advantages that we have allowed us to outgrow our industry for decades and will continue. Other carriers may be able to add service centers or purchase more equipment, but what has differentiated us from other carriers is not so easy to duplicate, which is our culture and our OD family spirit.\n Our people are the most important element of our strategic plan and our entire OD family of employees is committed to a culture of excellence. We invest significantly in our employees to help ensure that we are regularly educating and training our team. We have trained most 1/3 of our current drivers through our internal OD truck driving training program, and we intend to keep using this program to produce safe and qualified drivers.\n We also continue to invest in our management and sales training programs, which we believe will help produce the next generation of OD leaders. These are additional examples of decisions that create short-term costs, but are more willing to incur these costs to be prepared for our future. Our consistent investments in our people, our service and our network are the key reasons why we have one more market share than any other carrier over the past 10 years. Having each of these elements in place is also why we continue to believe that we are the best positioned company in the LTL industry to benefit from an improving economy.\n Delivering superior service is ultimately what wins market share in our industry. And I can assure you that everyone on OD's team is more committed than ever to deliver superior service to our customers and ultimately add value to our supply chains.\n We also have the financial strength and consistent returns to support investments needed to help achieve our long-term vision for profitable growth. As we continue to execute on a proven plan to achieve this vision, we believe we can drive further improvement in shareholder value.\n Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. \nAdam Satterfield: Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, which was a 1.2% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight was partially offset by the 3.2% decrease in LTL tons per day.\n Our quarterly operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% as compared to last year, while our earnings per diluted share increased 3.9% to $1.34. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.0% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day decreasing 5.5% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 5.2%.\n For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 1.3% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.0% in tons per day and a decrease of 0.3% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January decreased 3.9% as compared to December. February increased 1.9% from January, and March increased 2.4% as compared to February.\n The 10-year average change for these respective months is an increase of 0.8% in January, an increase of 1.5% in February and an increase of 4.8% in March. Please remember, however, that Good Friday was in March this year, and the average sequential change for March when that is the case, is an increase of 2.5%.\n While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 5.5% to 6% when compared to April of 2023. Our LTL tonnage per day has increased by approximately 2% to 2.5%, while LTL revenue per hundredweight has increased by approximately 4%. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, has increased approximately 4.5%, which is trending lower than our growth rate in the first quarter.\n We want to be clear that the slowdown in this metric does not represent any change in our pricing philosophy or a change in the overall pricing environment. Certain mix changes are impacting this metric in April as the change in our LTL revenue per shipment is more comparable with the first quarter.\n Nevertheless, we will continue with our long-term consistent approach of targeting yield improvements that exceed our cost inflation and support our capital expenditure program, and we believe we can achieve those initiatives this year. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q as usual.\n Our operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% for the first quarter of 2024, as the impact from the increase in our overhead cost more than offset the improvement rather than our direct costs. Many of our fixed overhead costs increased as a percent of revenue due to the flatness in revenue and the significance of our capital expenditures over the past year. This is most evidenced by the 50 basis point increase in our depreciation cost as a percent of revenue.\n We are pleased, however, that the improvement in yield and ongoing focus on operating efficiencies helped us improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue by approximately 100 basis points. This change included improvements in our operating supplies and expenses that offset a slight increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue.\n Our team continued to efficiently manage our variable costs while also delivering best-in-class service standards, which is not easy to do in an environment with lower operating density. We continued to believe that the keys to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment.\n Once we have those factors working in our favor again, we are confident in our ability to produce further improvement in our operating ratio and we'll continue to work towards our goal of producing a sub-70% annual operating ratio.\n Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $423.9 million for the first quarter, while capital expenditures were $119.5 million. We utilized $85.3 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the first quarter, while cash dividends totaled $56.6 million.\n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 25.6% as compared to 25.8% for the first quarter of 2023. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.4% for the second quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning.\n Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. \nRavi Shanker: So great summary of where we got to this point. Is 2Q the quarter where kind of we see the best of what this industry looks like in a post yellow environment, and if tonnage picks up and you have 2024 pricing that comes in, kind of how do we expect 2Q to trend versus seasonality? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think that's a difficult one to answer. It's obviously dependent on the top line. Typically, the second quarter is when we see the big acceleration in revenue and historically speaking, the 10-year average increase in revenue from the first to the second quarter is 8.7%. And we're not starting out with that type of growth in April. Things still feel good to us, and we're finally seeing some year-over-year revenue growth, but it's not quite at the levels of getting back to seasonality.\n We have been encouraged that we've seen our volumes increasing really into February, into March and have essentially increased thus far into April, but again, not at what those normal seasonal levels are.\n So to kind of frame up the second quarter operating ratio guidance, it's going to be very dependent on what the top line does. If you think about last year at this point in time, we were at a point where we weren't looking at any sequential revenue growth, and we were targeting margins to be flat. If we were able to grow at what the normal seasonal levels would be on the top line, that would be that 8.7%, sequential growth would be about 12% year-over-year growth.\n So obviously, we're ways away from that. Where we are at this sort of 6%, I would say we probably are somewhere in the middle of that sliding scale. If we were to stay at 6% year-over-year growth, then I would probably put us somewhere at a target of maybe about 150 basis points of improvement from the first quarter.\n So like always, the second quarter is going to be dependent upon how much acceleration we see. And we're not -- while we're encouraged by some things, we're not ready to make the call to say that things are definitely accelerating and that we can hit some of those sequential points as we go through May and June. But obviously, hopefully, we'll continue to see some acceleration there, and that will create operating density for us and will allow us to improve our margin from the first quarter to the second. \nOperator: The next question comes from Daniel Imbro of Stephens. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Grant on for Daniel. There was a comment in the release around some recent developments that suggest overall demand for your services may be improving. Could you maybe just provide a little more context around what that comment was referring to? Is it more a weight per shipment comment that is maybe impacting some of your yield metrics April that you discussed earlier? And maybe if you could also just provide a bit of an update on the underlying demand environment. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I would say right now, underlying domain has felt relatively consistent, but it does feel like things are improving a bit. And obviously, like I just mentioned, we've seen some sequential acceleration obviously, January, we see pretty good with winter weather, and we saw the impact of that. But we increased from there through February and then saw again some of the sequential improvement in shipments through March and thus far into April.\n But I feel like there are several factors that are starting to turn. We've been at -- and a long slow cycle for going back to April '22. And maybe to borrow a line from Taylor Swift is that over now, we're kind of waiting to see, but we saw ISM inflect back above 50% for the first time.\n Like you mentioned, our weight per shipment has increased again. We saw a little bit of a change from January to February. It dropped a little bit, but then it came back in March and at this point through April, we're up a little bit higher. So you sort of balance that with conversations that we've had from customers and we look at our national account reporting on wins and losses.\n There's a lot of good things that feel like they're developing. And if history repeats itself, usually a couple of months after that ISM reflect -- or inflects to the positive, we start seeing some improvement in our industrial activity as well. And that's something that will steal on our retail outperformed our industrial business in the first quarter.\n So if that's something that we can start seeing some recovery there, all of those things and factors hopefully will be increasing the demand for LTL service. And we're certainly in a position to take advantage of that opportunity as it presents itself. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. \nJordan Alliger: Just curious if you could talk to a little bit more the yield side of the equation, perhaps a little more color around mix, core pricing you're seeing as your contracts come up? And I guess, broadly, is this any way -- is the yield deceleration -- I don't know, is it tied in some way to more intense competition out there given industry spare capacity? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. That's why we wanted to be clear with the comments earlier that we don't see this in any way as being a reflection on the overall environment. And certainly, there is no change with respect to what our yield management initiatives are. We continue to target trying to achieve yield improvement that ultimately leads to our revenue per shipment outperforming our cost per shipment.\n That's something we've been able to achieve and we've targeted 100 to 150 basis points in the past. And obviously, with the weakness in the volume environment over the past year, we weren't able to achieve that positive spread in 2023, but we kept on investing and that's created more costs, and we're continuing to invest this year.\n I do think we're getting close back to this point and perhaps it will inflect back in the second quarter to where we do see a positive spread, probably not to that full 100 to 150 basis point delta. But I do think that we can see our revenue per shipment now going back above what our cost per shipment change would otherwise be.\n But we're continuing to work through contracts as they're coming due. We're winning some new business. Sometimes that can come on board when you look at things on a hundredweight basis, that number can skew and be skewed by multiple factors, be it the weight per shipment, the length of haul, which has been decreasing, the class of freight as well.\n There's multiple things that can move that number around and the year-over-year growth is just a little bit slower in April than where we were in the first quarter. But our revenue per shipment overall is what matters the most, and that's performing pretty consistent with where we were in the first quarter, at least from a core basis, it's a little bit higher right now, including the fuel.\n But on a core basis, looking at revenue per shipment ex fuel, pretty close to where we were in the first quarter. So -- and I still feel good about the environment and certainly seeing the activity that we've had internally and the increases that we continue to achieve, we feel good about things and especially the line of sight to seeing some positive spread once again of rev per ship outperforming the cost per ship. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. \nBascome Majors: I think your long-term shareholders can be happy with the discipline you've held through this 2-year protracted down cycle on sticking to your guidance and strategy and waiting to really monetize the capacity in the better part of the cycle in the future here, especially with all the changes in the competitive landscape and capacity moving around at some of your peers.\n But as you look forward and wait for that inflection, are there things you are looking for in that the market may have changed and the strategy does require a tweak here or there? I'm just curious internally what you're watching for to see that things may have shifted in some way, shape or form in the way that customers are viewing OD. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think certainly, time will tell and it's something that we continue to watch. And the business levels, our market share trends. All of those are pretty much have been in line with what we would have otherwise expected when we go through a slower economic environment. It's something where our market share is generally flattish and a little hard to track market share right now with the disruption post Yellow's closure.\n And maybe the way I look at it is slightly different than the way some of you do. But if I compare at least what we have from a fourth quarter reporting where all the other carriers have reported, it looks like we're in really good shape with -- if you compare back to the second quarter, so kind of before and after that event.\n And we've gained some market share relative to the other public carriers combined. And the largest carrier in the space has gained the most shipments again, second quarter to the fourth quarter, not looking at just a year-over-year percent change but pre-event, post event they have, and then there's one other carrier that's grown about the same as us, just a little bit higher shipments per day.\n And then all of the other public carriers are pretty flat when you look otherwise. And so a lot of what we have seen historically is similar types of trends. And then when the economy starts inflecting back to the positive, that's the time when OD's model shines the brightest, and we think that will happen once again.\n Once we get some economic recovery, if you will, some real economic improvement where we've been running against the wind for the past 2 years, we get some tailwind from the economy, I think you will see that volume growth come through our network and we'll be able to leverage that improvement in operating density to drive that with improved operating ratio.\n So we don't believe at this point that anything will be any different. Like Marty said earlier, we're really pleased with our customer retention trends. The way that we've seen business levels change over the past 1.5 years, and it's been slower. We're in place and ready to respond to our customers' needs when they see their businesses [ inflecting ] back to the positive.\n So all the things are in place. We just need a little bit more improvement in the underlying freight demand environment to capitalize on it and certainly feel like we're closer to that event changing and that inflection point, and there have been some green shoots that if you're looking at things from a glass half full kind of standpoint, which I typically do, that you can read through and see some potential opportunity for perhaps later this year.\n And so we're definitely in place. We feel like all the pieces are there. And we said it earlier, anyone can go out and you can buy terminals, you can buy equipment. But the thing that differentiates us the most is our people and our culture. And those are things that cannot be duplicated, certainly not in any short period of time. And I think the commitment that we have from each of our employees to excellence and delivering superior service for our customers is what will allow OD's model to continue to shine into the future and allow us to achieve our long-term market share initiatives. \nOperator: The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra of Deutsche Bank. \nAmit Mehrotra: Adam, I just wanted to go back to the OR comment on the second quarter. I mean, it's -- if I just look at revenue per day, I assume it should accelerate given maybe easier comps rest of the quarter. So you're growing maybe revenue mid- to high single digits in the second quarter. And so the implied incrementals on that are like 25% to 30% to get to OR in 2Q? And I would just imagine with all the pricing that's been taken in the industry and the front-end loaded nature of the cost, like we could do better than that. I don't know if that's a fair view or not, but I'd love to get your opinion on that.\n And then maybe more higher level on the OR, you've got, I think, right now, probably 18% of your revenue is direct cost, if I'm doing my calculations right, and it's been as low as maybe 16%, so you got a couple of hundred basis points there. And then there's obviously leverage on mix and variable costs. Can you just talk about kind of the levers to improve margins over the next couple of years if we do get a recovery because there is this view that there's not much more to go when you're already doing a 72, 73 OR. \nAdam Satterfield: Well, if you remember, we have done a 69.6 and a 69.1 in the second and third quarters of 2022 when we had more revenue growth going on and felt like we had room to go from there. So nothing's changed with respect to where we feel like we can take the operating ratio long term, which is part of the reason why we repeated the goal of being able to achieve a sub-70 annual operating ratio.\n But there's a few things to try to unpack from that question. And I would say that when we're initially in the upswing, get into the environment where we start seeing revenue growth again, eventually, when you get into it, that's periods of higher incremental margins for us, but you got to get to the point where you've got enough revenue to kind of recover some of the fixed overhead costs that -- and the growth, improvement or increase rather in some of the other variable costs that go along with preparing for growth.\n And we've already instituted some of those costs. For example, we've added about 500 people since September of last year. We were averaging 51,000 shipments per day in September last year, and now we're at about 48,000. So we've tried to continue to do all the things to get ahead of anticipated growth, and we're having to manage all of those costs, and we do.\n We manage the efficiency of all elements of our operation and trying to manage and match all of those costs with our revenue trends. But I would say that the uncertainty for the second quarter is just whether or not revenue will continue to accelerate or what we end up seeing if we continue to improve from here, that's going to be an improvement in operating density, and that will drive further improvement in our direct cost performance.\n If you pull our operating ratio in the first quarter apart, I think you may have said it in the inverse, but our direct cost, which are all the costs associated with moving freight, most of which are variable, we're about 53% of revenue. Our overhead costs, which are more fixed in nature, is between 20% to 21% of revenue.\n So those costs are somewhere around $300 million, a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. That $300 million is going to be there in the second quarter and it's probably going to be closer to $305 million, plus or minus. So you've kind of got that base cost to bounce around. But on -- and those being at 20% to 21% to one of your other points, yes, that's been as low as 16% in the past when you're really leveraging up, in particular, all the investments that we've made in capital expenditures and driving improvement there.\n On the direct cost side, though, that 53% just as late as the third quarter of last year, those costs were around 51%. And that was still in a tough operating environment. So we definitely have got further room for improvement from a direct cost basis. And then obviously, there's a lot of leverage there on the overhead side. And those factors are what gives us confidence that we can get the operating ratio back to sub-70.\n But we're not going to make decisions that would help cost in the short run that may jeopardize the opportunity in the long run. The reason we've been able to outgrow our competitors in strong growth periods like 2018, 2021, where our tonnage growth can be 1,000 basis points or more higher than the industry is because of the decisions we make in tougher times.\n We've got the financial strength to be able to invest in service center growth to be able to invest in our equipment to invest in employees and do all the things to be ready for that growth. And that's why oftentimes in those strongest growth periods, we're growing double-digit volumes and a lot of our competitors are flattish in those periods. So all those same strategic advantages, the pre-investment ahead of the growth curve, all of those continue to be in place, and we'll get the most leverage on them when we get into a real accelerating and growth environment again. \nAmit Mehrotra: But Adam, if I could just quickly follow up on that for a second because the strategy seems to be we're going to sit around and wait for somebody to get screw up, and that's when the market share opportunity is going to come. And that maybe have been the case in the last 10 or 15 years, but what's plan B? Like what happens if no national player screws up because everybody is focused on service and they actually deliver, what is the plan of action then? \nAdam Satterfield: Look, we're not just sitting back doing nothing. We're fighting every day to get better and working with each one of our customer accounts to make sure that we're in there. We're having conversations about how we're going to be able to grow with them. But we also don't have to feel the need to go out and try to chase volume, which many of competitors have done in the past, and then they get their network full and they're unable to grow.\n So the point that I was making earlier about there's not been as much growth when you look at what has happened sequentially over the last couple of quarters from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.\n I mean, when you look, I see that our share has improved from second quarter to fourth quarter, from third quarter to fourth quarter as well. So we're doing this in an environment that is not creating a lot of freight activity. I think that when we get out of this environment, I think that the time to challenge our model would be if we're in an environment where there is robust economic growth, and we're not able to achieve anything, but we are a long ways from there. \nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Morgan of Barclays. \nEric Morgan: I wanted to follow up on the demand environment and in particular, how you would characterize the depth of this to your slumping volumes because obviously, the industry is underperformed industrial production quite a bit since early '22. But if we benchmark 2019 and try to kind of look through the pandemic, both are kind of somewhat flat.\n So just curious if we think we've overcorrected and could see a bit of a catch-up on the upside, if there is some macro improvement? Or if you think maybe we're more an equilibrium now and should see more of kind of industrial production type growth from here? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I mean certainly in the past 2 years have felt more like 2009 recession. When you look back last year and see double-digit tonnage in some periods and overall for the year, we were down 9%. It was a very tough operating environment. But again, we continue to try to power through it and position ourselves for future market share opportunities.\n And I think that's what we've done, managing all of our other incremental costs along the way to keep producing what is by far and away the best operating ratio in our industry. And so I think that when you get back to an environment where transportation in general, the truckload market, in particular, has been incredibly weak.\n And I think there has been some spillover of volumes that have gone into that industry, just given the overall weakness there and players that are willing to move freight take some maybe large heavy-weighted LTL shipments for cost or less than their cost to operate just to kind of keep the trucks rolling. That's been another challenge, if you will, that we've had to contend with.\n But that will all change as the economy improves, just like we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that our industry will be tight once again. I continue to believe that despite some other carriers adding service centers that we will be a capacity challenged industry in the future as well.\n And ultimately, all of the service centers and door capacities that existed with Yellow, not 100% of that is going to come back into the market, as we've already seen with the process that it's played out over the last 9 months.\n So those are all things that we think will end up creating opportunities for us, again, and I think that once we have that tailwind coming at us from an overall industry demand standpoint that we'll be able to capitalize and be able to significantly grow our volumes like we've been able to do in the past and then leverage that growth through the operating ratio.\n And if you look back in any period in past, when we've lost the operating ratio in any given year or period and go back to 2009 and look at that, we lost -- the operating ratio deteriorated 270 basis points that year. Once we get the power of leverage in the model, we more than recover anything that we've lost. In that example, in 2010, when things really were robust again, we were able to improve the OR by 360 basis points.\n So I feel like though from getting to the improvement cycle that it feels similar to 2017, where things are kind of on the edge of getting ready to start showing improvement again. And hopefully, we'll continue to see some growth as we go through the middle part of the year, some year-over-year growth and further sequential improvement and then things really start taking off and we'll go from there.\n But that's -- the good thing about our mid-quarter updates is we're going to give it to you as we go along. So you'll see the final April results we'll put in our 10-Q, the final May results from a revenue standpoint will publish. And you'll know it is developing versus me having to look through the crystal ball and predict when we're going to see the big inflection in revenue coming. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bruce Chan of Stifel. \nJ. Bruce Chan: Jack, congrats and Adam, I didn't take you for a Swiftie, but maybe if I can borrow a line from her as well, just a question about the tortured pricing department here. We've heard from a couple of shippers that there's one last push going on for lower rates, especially some of those that may be negotiated in the first quarter of '23. And kind of felt like they missed a little bit of the ride there. Have you seen any of that? And specifically, have you seen any pull forward in bid activity early in the year? Any extra color on the pricing trends for this year, certainly helpful. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I've got a teenage daughter, so I can't help but hear certain types of music in the house. But on the pricing front, we've not really seen any material change in activity or bid activity. And for us, it's pretty consistent through the year in terms of how bids come in. And so pretty much just business as usual there. And again, like we said earlier, continuing to get the same types of increases on a core basis that we've seen in the past. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Adam [ Rusckowski ] on for Ken Hoexter. The team and Jack, I hope the other side is treating you well. So why don't you get back to the excess capacity comment you noted about 30%. Could you remind us of the current capacity expansion plan maybe in the near term or over the next couple of years? And then average headcount was up slightly sequentially. How should we think about the headcount run rate for the balance of the year? And maybe could this serve as a potential cost lever? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. From a headcount standpoint, I mentioned that we've added about 500 people since September of last year. So I feel like we're in good shape there. The other thing is that we are running our truck driving schools. And so some of the people that we pulled from a platform position and put them into a truck in the fall to respond to that sequential acceleration in business, we've been able to backfill those platforms roles with the hiring, but also have trained more drivers to have those employees and drivers and ready reserve, if you will, to respond to an increase in demand if it continues to accelerate from here. So it's pretty much in balance right now with the change in full-time employees with shipments.\n And that's something that generally is balanced over the long term. But I feel like we try to get a little bit ahead of it, but we're cautiously optimistic about and has been for the last quarter. So that was why we went ahead and tried to invest there in that employee growth, but we'll continue to watch and we're a little bit ahead of it.\n We've got different levers that we can pull if volumes are accelerating to where you don't have to hire on a one-for-one basis with growth. But we're in a good spot. May be kind of flattish from here. But depending on we see further acceleration coming through, say, now to anticipate through September, then that might require some further hiring. But no real immediate need at this point to do anything in a material way. I feel like our employee count is pretty well balanced with the volumes that we're seeing. Maybe Marty will address the service center capacity. \nKevin Freeman: Yes. From a capacity standpoint, we always try to maintain at least 25%. And with the 30% that we have now, some of that comes from what we started as a -- enlarging some of our docs that we had experienced some tight door pressure in which we keep a door pressure report going on a monthly basis. But some of those things are finishing up from expansions in 2022, that's the reason for the 30%.\n But we always try to keep excess capacity because we're confident this economy is going to turn for us and if not this year, beginning in next year. So there's nothing worse than getting an influx and promises from customers for additional business and not having enough capacity to handle it. So that's why we try to keep that 25% to 30% at all times. \nOperator: The next question comes from Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. \nJoseph Lawrence Hafling: This is Joe Hafling on for Stephanie. I hate to ask again on the capacity question, but you've mentioned a couple of times how you think that the strategy of the past would continue to work and the environment itself will become tight. But with sort of all the rest of the national players essentially copying the Old Dominion playbook and trying to keep a 20% to 30% excess capacity figure themselves, how are you thinking about keeping incremental capacity or adding incremental capacity?\n And do you think that the industry overall today with everybody trying to be like Old Dominion, does that lead to the industry just having excess capacity more than there ever was in the prior decade? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I think that at the end of the day, capacity is not what wins business. It allows you to achieve market share initiatives. So having capacity doesn't necessarily mean that anyone is going to be able to grow, it just gives the ability to grow. Service is ultimately what wins share and relationships in this business as well.\n And I think that we've been able to strengthen our customer relationships over time, our sales and our pricing teams, the relationships that they formed with our customers, the consistency of our business practices, the consistency of our yield management practices as well. All that goes into forming strong bonds between us and our customers.\n And so we continue to look at ways that we can add further value to our customers' supply chains. And we look for ways that we can continue to execute on a continuous improvement process, which is a central element of our foundation for success. So we've got a better service product than anyone else in our industry. We're proud that we've won the Mastio Quality Award for 14 years in a row and the service gap between us and the others actually got wider in last year's analysis.\n So that's something that we remain focused on and keep trying to do things that our customers are asking from us and to be able to deliver that superior service at a fair price to our customers as well. So the competition that is trying to emulate us, I guess that's one to say about imitation being the most sincere form of flattery.\n We'll continue to watch and see what they're doing, but it's something that people have been trying to emulate for years, and we're not sitting still to let someone try to come up and catch us. We're working hard every day to get better to make sure that, that service gap and the overall value gap that we add continues to get wider. \nJoseph Lawrence Hafling: Great. And then maybe just on that point, have you heard any maybe anecdotes from customers lately on any service issues? Or is the environment just still too weak right now, so that's really become an issue? \nAdam Satterfield: I haven't heard anything out of the ordinary, things that we wouldn't normally hear. But the reporting -- we've had some improvement in our -- the national account reporting that we get with wins and losses. And service issues are starting to increase, I would just say, generally. We're starting to see those start to pick up. So just something that's kind of on the press pace of one other item that's kind of changing in our favor. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. \nJason Seidl: A couple of quick questions here. Number one, when we're thinking about sort of either the tonnage or market share, it seems that pre-pandemic, it was more of a just-in-time supply chain, and that shifted a little bit to just in case now. It seems like we're probably moving back a little bit more towards the JIT. Is this something that just sort of favors your operational model and service standards? And if it does, should we expect you to sort of get back to sort of the old ways of Old Dominion of sort of being the market share leader? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes, I think so, Jason, I agree with you. And I felt like post-pandemic, we were going to stay in more of an adjusting case type of inventory management style. But once things get tight and you start managing cost, you have to look at all elements and managing tighter inventory is one way for shippers to improve their overall bottom line.\n And so we've seen that trend kind of work its way back to the JIT. And we've had anecdotal feedback from customers that have come in and visited us as well that may have had elevated inventory levels that they have now worked through. So hopefully, that will be a good thing for us.\n And it generally is, obviously, if you're managing tighter inventory, you've got to rely on a shipper that can deliver on time and without damage. If you don't have excess inventory sitting around, you can't afford to have a shipment come in that's completely damaged and you've got to deal with a return and reorder type of situation.\n And so that has supported our ability to win market share over time. It's something that we think will continue to allow us to win market share as we go forward and it works both with our industrial and our retail customers. But on the retail side, with the on-demand and in full programs that many retailers have put in place to manage their inventory, that's a tremendous opportunity for continued growth in our business as well.\n And we're able to meet the expectations of those retailers and take the vendor-controlled freight and make sure that we hit those delivery windows, and we're doing at 99% of the time and without any type of damage. So we're minimizing in some cases, millions of dollars of chargebacks for retail-related customers that are delivering into those big box retailers with those on-time and full programs in place.\n So a lot of good opportunity when we look down the long-term curve, and it's why we're so confident in our ability to keep winning market share into the future. I feel like we continue to have a long runway for growth. And that's what dictates and determines our capital expenditure program. We look at where we see growth coming from, a lot of that is based on customer conversations that we're having for how their business levels are going to be changing into the future as well and that dictates how we continue to expand out our network.\n So as long as we have line of sight into the next 5 years of growth, and that's generally what we're kind of pre-investing for, we will continue to invest the money into our real estate program and further expand the service center network. But it's all grounded on a line of sight in the market share opportunities. It's not just a build it and hope they come. \nJason Seidl: Right. That makes sense. And if I can just follow up with a clarification something. You talked about your growth rates month-to-date in April. But did I miss -- did you guys give how that compares to historical averages? \nAdam Satterfield: In terms on a sequential standpoint or... \nJason Seidl: Yes, because I think you mentioned the sequential gain in tonnage in April, but I don't know if I missed the historical average comp. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. So far, I mean, obviously, we're not completely done, but we're somewhere around 48,000 shipments per day. So just up slightly from where we were in March. And we'll see hopefully, that will increase a little bit that average count, if you will. But when we look at what normal seasonality, the 10-year average is a 0.4% increase from March into April for shipments.\n But recall that we had a Good Friday is in there in March this year. So in years where that is the case, it would be a 2% increase from March to April. So right now, trending lower than that 2% growth, but when you look back at kind of what we were able to achieve in February and March, again, consistent growth.\n And on the tonnage side, we saw just call it 2% sequential growth from January to February and then about 2.5% from February to March, demonstrating a little bit of pickup in weight per shipment there that kind of help that metric. And that metric was essentially in alignment with the 10-year average or rather the adjusted average that reflects Good Friday being in March.\n So it's good to see that we're finally seeing month-over-month improvement there versus I've mentioned before from April of '22 through December, we were kind of in a declining environment and then just flat from December at 47,000 shipments per day, December '22, all the way to August when we had the big industry event and that acceleration that we saw pretty much a step function change that happened on an immediate basis. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. \nBrian Ossenbeck: So Adam, I just wanted to ask a little bit more about how you view the truckload market here. I know in the past, you said you thought some other freight moved over. I think you mentioned it earlier. But how much of that went over I guess, with the disruption with Yellow, do you still think that can come back to LTL and tighten it up?\n So is that kind of above and beyond what you normally see from a cyclical perspective? And maybe on a related topic, are you seeing anything interesting in terms of April shipping weight per shipment? Is that sort of a leading indicator that you're watching to see for early signs of stabilization improvement? \nKevin Freeman: Yes, this is Marty. I agree with Adam that some of this Yellow freight did move over to full truckload carriers in the form of stop-offs where they take 3 or 4 shipments along with a 75% load and charge a couple of hundred bucks to do stock offs. They don't really like to do that nor do their drivers like to do it, but I do believe this moved over there because of the slowness in the truckload market this year and last year.\n And I also agree that this will move back to LTL carriers once the truckload market picks back up. So -- and I suspect that will happen at the same time the LTL market starts to flourish again. So that will come straight back to the LTL market. \nBrian Ossenbeck: Any thoughts on weight per shipment and how that's trending and how we should expect that throughout the rest of the year? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. We hope to see it continue to increase. That's typically an indicator of an improving economy as well. Like I mentioned, an increase from February to March, it's increased a little bit from March thus far into April as well. So that's something that we're probably on the low end of the scale in terms of how that metric changes.\n It got a little skewed, if you will, with post Yellow and some of the incremental freight that we saw there. But historically speaking, in a strong demand environment, we've been closer to 1,600 pounds as an overall average. We're still down around 1,515 pounds and so we definitely have got some room to grow there.\n And that, too, creates and that's part of the leverage that you get from an operating ratio standpoint is weight continues to increase, you're getting more revenue per shipment, and that will help overall offset and kind of close that gap that we've seen with cost per shipment over the past years. The call relatively speaking, is -- should be very similar, but you're just getting more weight and more revenue per load, if you will. \nOperator: The next question comes from Tom Wadewitz of UBS. \nThomas Wadewitz: I wanted to -- it seems to me like the -- I guess, the freight environment improvement is a key catalyst for what you're going to see on the tonnage side and give you a chance to benefit from the capacity and service you can offer. What have you seen in terms of industrial customers versus the kind of retail and consumer customers where there's any kind of difference in behavior or trend or optimism.\n And I guess related maybe more to the retail side. It's been surprising that container imports have been pretty strong for a number of months. And yet the domestic freight environment seems like it's still pretty soft. So I don't know if you have any thoughts on what might be going on there if there's some inventory. But I guess any color on differences in customer segments or maybe why the imports aren't translating to domestic activity so much. \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. Overall, the retail continued to reflect -- or the industrial rather reflect the weakness that we've seen in the industrial economy. And in the first quarter, we had 1% revenue growth, but it was actually a slight decrease when you look at just our industrial-related accounts group together. So a little bit better performance on the retail side to offset that in the first quarter.\n But again, hopefully, that's something now that we've seen ISM trend back above 50%, it had been below 50% for 16 months. I mean just this long, incredibly slow environment that we've been slugging through. But generally speaking, that indicates that improvement in that industrial environment, if we can stay above 50%, it should be coming, and that could be sort of in that May time frame.\n So it's something that we'll continue to watch. But the retail continues to perform. We've also seen an improvement in the business that's managed by third-party logistics companies. And that's kind of in the early stages as well, but seeing some improvement there. I think is a good sign. Oftentimes, the 3PLs that have the systems, they're able to identify some of those top-off shipments that Marty was referencing earlier by being able to look through their entire inventory of capacity versus shipments.\n And so if we're starting to see some growth there again with those and maybe some of that type of truck versus LTL swing might start reversing course. But again, I think it's just a lot of things are kind of in the early stages that we got to keep watch on and I don't want to get overly caught up in and -- but keep our fingers on the pulse, if you will, and continue to watch the trends and see if it manifests into increased LTL demand overall for which I think that we will more than be able to win our share. \nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research. \nScott Group: So Adam, I know we're at the hour, there have been a lot of questions on price already, but -- so some of this may be repetitive. But like obviously, this these LTL stocks are getting hit pretty hard today, but the April yield numbers, they are what they are. But I just want to make sure, are you -- it doesn't feel like it, but are you in any way communicating any kind of change in the underlying pricing environment here, the competitive dynamic? I know you don't share pricing renewals every quarter like some of the other LTLs but maybe this quarter could be helpful. Are they slowing? Is it -- what's changing in your mind? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. And again, to repeat, nothing is changing with respect to the core contract increases that we're achieving and that we're targeting. We continue to target cost plus increases, and we're getting those. It's just a little bit different in the mix of freight that we're seeing. We've seen a little bit of a decrease in length of haul.\n Some change in increase in weight per shipment, like I mentioned, all those factors kind of lead to a lower revenue per hundredweight. So just looking at things on a pure per hundredweight basis, it's gone from, just call it, 6.5% growth in the first quarter to 4.5% excluding fuel so far in April.\n But we've said before, hundredweight can move around quickly, and that's why internally, we focus more on revenue per shipment than anything. That's what we pick up every day, our shipments, and that's what we've got to figure out what's the cost to pick up a shipment. What's the cost of line haul a shipment, cross-docket. Everything that we do is driven on a per shipment basis.\n And I mean I think we can get back to having a positive spread of revenue per shipment versus our cost per shipment performance. So that will continue to be the initiative. I don't see anything changing with respect to the pricing environment and nothing changing that we've seen as we've gone through renewals and bids and so forth with respect to the other carriers in the industry.\n And obviously, we'll see with their reports when they come out. But we've not seen anything change in that regard. It's just some mix changes that are impacting our revenue per hundredweight metrics thus far into April. \nScott Group: But just so I'm clear, I don't think you guys talked about revenue per shipment accelerating with this mix shift or maybe it is, I just didn't hear that. \nAdam Satterfield: No, but it's staying consistent with where we were. The rev per shipment performance in April thus far is pretty consistent with what we just had in the first quarter. We were up 3.8% revenue per shipment in the first quarter, excluding the fuel surcharge. \nScott Group: Okay. And then just one more question. You talked about like just the power of leverage. Now if I take what you're saying about Q2, you're sort of saying mid-single-digit plus sort of top line growth and flattish OR, right? So historically, we get mid-single-digit top line, and we see real OR improvement. How come -- maybe it's just a timing issue, how come you're not suggesting we see that the power of that leverage right away in Q2? \nAdam Satterfield: Well, I think that's something that obviously depending on how much volume growth we actually see in the quarter or not sequentially. We've invested significantly in many factors that we detailed earlier that create short-term costs. So if we can see some further improvement and if weight and shipments really accelerate kind of from here forward, and obviously, there's a lot of leverage that would therefore come from that.\n But that's something that if we're -- if we continue to grow revenue, it's kind of a 6% year-over-year rate like we saw in April, then we tried to give a factor of, okay, maybe we'll only see 150 basis points of sequential improvement, which would still be a year-over-year improvement where we were in the second quarter last year.\n But I think it's just going to move on a sliding scale, if you will, based on how much revenue comes in. And typically, like I mentioned, the revenue growth is between 8.5% and 9% to 8.7% from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we're just not there yet. And hopefully, we see further sequential improvement in May and June. And obviously, we give those -- we'll give the update for May, with our mid-quarter update as we go along.\n But the improvement that we see in the operating ratio is typically 350 to 400 basis points of improvement. A lot of that improvement comes by way of the direct costs. It's mainly the salaries, wages and benefits and are op supplies and expenses, and that's coming from the improvement in operating density and taking advantage of all that incremental freight that's moving through the system.\n So if all those things do develop, then obviously, we can produce further improvement in those direct costs. And like I mentioned earlier, from a headcount standpoint, I feel good about where we are. So it's not like we've got to scale up even more in terms of our hiring practices. But we'll probably be working more hours and doing things like that with the existing workforce. So there's opportunity to scale there. But like any other period, it's just going to be top line dependent for how much growth do we see and how much of that incremental growth will be able to put to the bottom line. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Kauffman: And Jack, congratulations, really looking forward to working with you in this role. A lot's been asked, so I just want to take a step back. It's been a weird couple of years, right? We had COVID, big up, big down, inflation. We've had inventory destocking. We've had the Yellow closure. We've had a lot of growth in private fleets. All of this, I think, makes it difficult to predict what's going to happen with business.\n But eventually, we do anniversary all these impacts and things start to resemble what might be considered a more normal operating environment. When do you think we get back to that? And where is your vision most foggy relative to what it would be without these oddities that have occurred? \nAdam Satterfield: Yes. I don't have my Carnac the Magnificent happier handy to be able to predict on when things are going to change, but that's probably the most buzziest thing is when will the inflection point happen. We -- obviously, it's called a cycle for a reason, and we will get back into a robust demand environment at some point. And when we do, we will be able to take advantage of that.\n And we've built the company up. We've been growing our company for years and continue to believe that we've got a lot of growth opportunity as we look out into the future. So obviously, we put on a lot of growth. We're able to grow our revenues, $1 billion in each of 2021 and 2022 and then ran into the slowdown in the economy.\n So we've been making our way through that very well, very proud of the operating ratio that we were able to produce last year in a challenging environment. And we're still in an environment that we're not out of the woods yet, if you will. We still had in the first quarter, a 3% reduction in tons per day and essentially had a flat operating ratio, but we're able to produce positive earnings per share as well.\n So I feel good about the base level of operations where we are today and being able to build on what we've established. So there's a long runway for growth out there when it comes to a top line standpoint that we believe for our business. And we've got further room to improve our operating ratio as well. And so that will allow us to achieve our vision of achieving long-term profitable growth that drives an increase in shareholder value.\n So all those same elements are in place. There may be some different logos that have been moving around on service centers and different customers, given all the disruption that's taken place over the last 6 to 9 months. But OD stands ready, and we'll continue to add value to our customer supply chains and we feel like we'll be able to drive significant growth in our business as we go forward. \nJeffrey Kauffman: As funny as you were talking about the service centers, I was just thinking you can add all the service centers you want, but that doesn't make your service or your culture equivalent. \nAdam Satterfield: And that's a great observation. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Marty Freeman for any closing remarks. \nKevin Freeman: Yes. I'd like to thank all of you today for your participation, and we really appreciate your questions. If you have anything further, please feel free to give us a call, and we'll be glad to answer it. And I hope you have a good rest of the week. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call this morning. With me on the call today is Adam Satterfield, our CFO. And after some brief remarks, we will be glad to take your questions. Old Dominion's financial results improved during the first quarter of 2024 despite the continued softness in the domestic economy.\n While the improvement in our results was modest, we produced year-over-year increases in both revenue and earnings per diluted share for the second straight quarter. Our earnings per diluted share of $1.34 also represents a new company record for the first quarter. To produce these results, our OD family of employees continued to execute on long-term strategic plan that helped create one of the strongest records of growth and profitability in the LTL industry.\n This was evidenced by our team's ability to once again deliver 99% on-time service and a 0.1 cargo claims ratio for the first quarter. Consistently delivering superior service at a fair price is the central element of our strategic plan, and we have created a best-in-class value proposition as a result. This value proposition continues to create opportunities for us to win market share over the long term and has also helped strengthen our customer relationships.\n Our customer retention trends have remained steady over the past 2 years despite a domestic economy that has been sluggish for longer than we originally anticipated. Our customers have had fewer shipments to give us as a result of the slower economic environment, but we are strongly positioned to respond to their needs when demand eventually improves.\n Demand can quickly -- can very quickly change in the LTL industry and the OD team has experience in dealing with these challenges that rapid growth can present. This is why we focus so intently on our long-term market share initiatives and make decisions to help us achieve these goals despite the cost implications that may impact us at the short term.\n Our capital expenditure program is a prime example of this, as we have invested $757.3 million in total capital expenditures in 2023 and expect to spend approximately $750 million this year to stay ahead of our growth curve. The resulting depreciation has recreated some short-term cost headwinds that slightly impacted our first quarter operating ratio, but we have improved our fleet and also have approximately 30% excess capacity in our service center network to support future growth.\n The LTL industry has seen significant disruption over the past 9 months, but we believe the strategic advantages that we have allowed us to outgrow our industry for decades and will continue. Other carriers may be able to add service centers or purchase more equipment, but what has differentiated us from other carriers is not so easy to duplicate, which is our culture and our OD family spirit.\n Our people are the most important element of our strategic plan and our entire OD family of employees is committed to a culture of excellence. We invest significantly in our employees to help ensure that we are regularly educating and training our team. We have trained most 1/3 of our current drivers through our internal OD truck driving training program, and we intend to keep using this program to produce safe and qualified drivers.\n We also continue to invest in our management and sales training programs, which we believe will help produce the next generation of OD leaders. These are additional examples of decisions that create short-term costs, but are more willing to incur these costs to be prepared for our future. Our consistent investments in our people, our service and our network are the key reasons why we have one more market share than any other carrier over the past 10 years. Having each of these elements in place is also why we continue to believe that we are the best positioned company in the LTL industry to benefit from an improving economy.\n Delivering superior service is ultimately what wins market share in our industry. And I can assure you that everyone on OD's team is more committed than ever to deliver superior service to our customers and ultimately add value to our supply chains.\n We also have the financial strength and consistent returns to support investments needed to help achieve our long-term vision for profitable growth. As we continue to execute on a proven plan to achieve this vision, we believe we can drive further improvement in shareholder value.\n Thank you for joining us this morning. And now Adam will discuss our first quarter financial results in greater detail. Yes. From a capacity standpoint, we always try to maintain at least 25%. And with the 30% that we have now, some of that comes from what we started as a -- enlarging some of our docs that we had experienced some tight door pressure in which we keep a door pressure report going on a monthly basis. But some of those things are finishing up from expansions in 2022, that's the reason for the 30%.\n But we always try to keep excess capacity because we're confident this economy is going to turn for us and if not this year, beginning in next year. So there's nothing worse than getting an influx and promises from customers for additional business and not having enough capacity to handle it. So that's why we try to keep that 25% to 30% at all times. Yes, this is Marty. I agree with Adam that some of this Yellow freight did move over to full truckload carriers in the form of stop-offs where they take 3 or 4 shipments along with a 75% load and charge a couple of hundred bucks to do stock offs. They don't really like to do that nor do their drivers like to do it, but I do believe this moved over there because of the slowness in the truckload market this year and last year.\n And I also agree that this will move back to LTL carriers once the truckload market picks back up. So -- and I suspect that will happen at the same time the LTL market starts to flourish again. So that will come straight back to the LTL market. Yes. I'd like to thank all of you today for your participation, and we really appreciate your questions. If you have anything further, please feel free to give us a call, and we'll be glad to answer it. And I hope you have a good rest of the week. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Marty, and good morning. Old Dominion's revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was $1.5 billion, which was a 1.2% increase from the prior year. This slight increase in revenue was primarily due to a 4.1% increase in LTL revenue per hundredweight was partially offset by the 3.2% decrease in LTL tons per day.\n Our quarterly operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% as compared to last year, while our earnings per diluted share increased 3.9% to $1.34. On a sequential basis, our revenue per day for the first quarter decreased 7.0% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023 with LTL tons per day decreasing 5.5% and LTL shipments per day decreasing 5.2%.\n For comparison, the 10-year average sequential change for these metrics includes a decrease of 1.3% in revenue per day, a decrease of 1.0% in tons per day and a decrease of 0.3% in shipments per day. The monthly sequential changes in LTL tons per day during the first quarter were as follows: January decreased 3.9% as compared to December. February increased 1.9% from January, and March increased 2.4% as compared to February.\n The 10-year average change for these respective months is an increase of 0.8% in January, an increase of 1.5% in February and an increase of 4.8% in March. Please remember, however, that Good Friday was in March this year, and the average sequential change for March when that is the case, is an increase of 2.5%.\n While there are still a few work days remaining in April, our month-to-date revenue per day has increased by approximately 5.5% to 6% when compared to April of 2023. Our LTL tonnage per day has increased by approximately 2% to 2.5%, while LTL revenue per hundredweight has increased by approximately 4%. Our LTL revenue per hundredweight, excluding fuel surcharges, has increased approximately 4.5%, which is trending lower than our growth rate in the first quarter.\n We want to be clear that the slowdown in this metric does not represent any change in our pricing philosophy or a change in the overall pricing environment. Certain mix changes are impacting this metric in April as the change in our LTL revenue per shipment is more comparable with the first quarter.\n Nevertheless, we will continue with our long-term consistent approach of targeting yield improvements that exceed our cost inflation and support our capital expenditure program, and we believe we can achieve those initiatives this year. We will provide the actual revenue-related details for April in our first quarter Form 10-Q as usual.\n Our operating ratio increased 10 basis points to 73.5% for the first quarter of 2024, as the impact from the increase in our overhead cost more than offset the improvement rather than our direct costs. Many of our fixed overhead costs increased as a percent of revenue due to the flatness in revenue and the significance of our capital expenditures over the past year. This is most evidenced by the 50 basis point increase in our depreciation cost as a percent of revenue.\n We are pleased, however, that the improvement in yield and ongoing focus on operating efficiencies helped us improve our direct operating cost as a percent of revenue by approximately 100 basis points. This change included improvements in our operating supplies and expenses that offset a slight increase in salaries, wages and benefits as a percent of revenue.\n Our team continued to efficiently manage our variable costs while also delivering best-in-class service standards, which is not easy to do in an environment with lower operating density. We continued to believe that the keys to long-term operating ratio improvement are the combination of density and yield, both of which generally require a favorable macroeconomic environment.\n Once we have those factors working in our favor again, we are confident in our ability to produce further improvement in our operating ratio and we'll continue to work towards our goal of producing a sub-70% annual operating ratio.\n Old Dominion's cash flow from operations totaled $423.9 million for the first quarter, while capital expenditures were $119.5 million. We utilized $85.3 million of cash for our share repurchase program during the first quarter, while cash dividends totaled $56.6 million.\n Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2024 was 25.6% as compared to 25.8% for the first quarter of 2023. We currently anticipate our effective tax rate to be 25.4% for the second quarter. This concludes our prepared remarks this morning.\n Operator, we're happy to open the floor for questions at this time. Yes. I think that's a difficult one to answer. It's obviously dependent on the top line. Typically, the second quarter is when we see the big acceleration in revenue and historically speaking, the 10-year average increase in revenue from the first to the second quarter is 8.7%. And we're not starting out with that type of growth in April. Things still feel good to us, and we're finally seeing some year-over-year revenue growth, but it's not quite at the levels of getting back to seasonality.\n We have been encouraged that we've seen our volumes increasing really into February, into March and have essentially increased thus far into April, but again, not at what those normal seasonal levels are.\n So to kind of frame up the second quarter operating ratio guidance, it's going to be very dependent on what the top line does. If you think about last year at this point in time, we were at a point where we weren't looking at any sequential revenue growth, and we were targeting margins to be flat. If we were able to grow at what the normal seasonal levels would be on the top line, that would be that 8.7%, sequential growth would be about 12% year-over-year growth.\n So obviously, we're ways away from that. Where we are at this sort of 6%, I would say we probably are somewhere in the middle of that sliding scale. If we were to stay at 6% year-over-year growth, then I would probably put us somewhere at a target of maybe about 150 basis points of improvement from the first quarter.\n So like always, the second quarter is going to be dependent upon how much acceleration we see. And we're not -- while we're encouraged by some things, we're not ready to make the call to say that things are definitely accelerating and that we can hit some of those sequential points as we go through May and June. But obviously, hopefully, we'll continue to see some acceleration there, and that will create operating density for us and will allow us to improve our margin from the first quarter to the second. Yes, I would say right now, underlying domain has felt relatively consistent, but it does feel like things are improving a bit. And obviously, like I just mentioned, we've seen some sequential acceleration obviously, January, we see pretty good with winter weather, and we saw the impact of that. But we increased from there through February and then saw again some of the sequential improvement in shipments through March and thus far into April.\n But I feel like there are several factors that are starting to turn. We've been at -- and a long slow cycle for going back to April '22. And maybe to borrow a line from Taylor Swift is that over now, we're kind of waiting to see, but we saw ISM inflect back above 50% for the first time.\n Like you mentioned, our weight per shipment has increased again. We saw a little bit of a change from January to February. It dropped a little bit, but then it came back in March and at this point through April, we're up a little bit higher. So you sort of balance that with conversations that we've had from customers and we look at our national account reporting on wins and losses.\n There's a lot of good things that feel like they're developing. And if history repeats itself, usually a couple of months after that ISM reflect -- or inflects to the positive, we start seeing some improvement in our industrial activity as well. And that's something that will steal on our retail outperformed our industrial business in the first quarter.\n So if that's something that we can start seeing some recovery there, all of those things and factors hopefully will be increasing the demand for LTL service. And we're certainly in a position to take advantage of that opportunity as it presents itself. Yes. That's why we wanted to be clear with the comments earlier that we don't see this in any way as being a reflection on the overall environment. And certainly, there is no change with respect to what our yield management initiatives are. We continue to target trying to achieve yield improvement that ultimately leads to our revenue per shipment outperforming our cost per shipment.\n That's something we've been able to achieve and we've targeted 100 to 150 basis points in the past. And obviously, with the weakness in the volume environment over the past year, we weren't able to achieve that positive spread in 2023, but we kept on investing and that's created more costs, and we're continuing to invest this year.\n I do think we're getting close back to this point and perhaps it will inflect back in the second quarter to where we do see a positive spread, probably not to that full 100 to 150 basis point delta. But I do think that we can see our revenue per shipment now going back above what our cost per shipment change would otherwise be.\n But we're continuing to work through contracts as they're coming due. We're winning some new business. Sometimes that can come on board when you look at things on a hundredweight basis, that number can skew and be skewed by multiple factors, be it the weight per shipment, the length of haul, which has been decreasing, the class of freight as well.\n There's multiple things that can move that number around and the year-over-year growth is just a little bit slower in April than where we were in the first quarter. But our revenue per shipment overall is what matters the most, and that's performing pretty consistent with where we were in the first quarter, at least from a core basis, it's a little bit higher right now, including the fuel.\n But on a core basis, looking at revenue per shipment ex fuel, pretty close to where we were in the first quarter. So -- and I still feel good about the environment and certainly seeing the activity that we've had internally and the increases that we continue to achieve, we feel good about things and especially the line of sight to seeing some positive spread once again of rev per ship outperforming the cost per ship. Yes. I think certainly, time will tell and it's something that we continue to watch. And the business levels, our market share trends. All of those are pretty much have been in line with what we would have otherwise expected when we go through a slower economic environment. It's something where our market share is generally flattish and a little hard to track market share right now with the disruption post Yellow's closure.\n And maybe the way I look at it is slightly different than the way some of you do. But if I compare at least what we have from a fourth quarter reporting where all the other carriers have reported, it looks like we're in really good shape with -- if you compare back to the second quarter, so kind of before and after that event.\n And we've gained some market share relative to the other public carriers combined. And the largest carrier in the space has gained the most shipments again, second quarter to the fourth quarter, not looking at just a year-over-year percent change but pre-event, post event they have, and then there's one other carrier that's grown about the same as us, just a little bit higher shipments per day.\n And then all of the other public carriers are pretty flat when you look otherwise. And so a lot of what we have seen historically is similar types of trends. And then when the economy starts inflecting back to the positive, that's the time when OD's model shines the brightest, and we think that will happen once again.\n Once we get some economic recovery, if you will, some real economic improvement where we've been running against the wind for the past 2 years, we get some tailwind from the economy, I think you will see that volume growth come through our network and we'll be able to leverage that improvement in operating density to drive that with improved operating ratio.\n So we don't believe at this point that anything will be any different. Like Marty said earlier, we're really pleased with our customer retention trends. The way that we've seen business levels change over the past 1.5 years, and it's been slower. We're in place and ready to respond to our customers' needs when they see their businesses [ inflecting ] back to the positive.\n So all the things are in place. We just need a little bit more improvement in the underlying freight demand environment to capitalize on it and certainly feel like we're closer to that event changing and that inflection point, and there have been some green shoots that if you're looking at things from a glass half full kind of standpoint, which I typically do, that you can read through and see some potential opportunity for perhaps later this year.\n And so we're definitely in place. We feel like all the pieces are there. And we said it earlier, anyone can go out and you can buy terminals, you can buy equipment. But the thing that differentiates us the most is our people and our culture. And those are things that cannot be duplicated, certainly not in any short period of time. And I think the commitment that we have from each of our employees to excellence and delivering superior service for our customers is what will allow OD's model to continue to shine into the future and allow us to achieve our long-term market share initiatives. Well, if you remember, we have done a 69.6 and a 69.1 in the second and third quarters of 2022 when we had more revenue growth going on and felt like we had room to go from there. So nothing's changed with respect to where we feel like we can take the operating ratio long term, which is part of the reason why we repeated the goal of being able to achieve a sub-70 annual operating ratio.\n But there's a few things to try to unpack from that question. And I would say that when we're initially in the upswing, get into the environment where we start seeing revenue growth again, eventually, when you get into it, that's periods of higher incremental margins for us, but you got to get to the point where you've got enough revenue to kind of recover some of the fixed overhead costs that -- and the growth, improvement or increase rather in some of the other variable costs that go along with preparing for growth.\n And we've already instituted some of those costs. For example, we've added about 500 people since September of last year. We were averaging 51,000 shipments per day in September last year, and now we're at about 48,000. So we've tried to continue to do all the things to get ahead of anticipated growth, and we're having to manage all of those costs, and we do.\n We manage the efficiency of all elements of our operation and trying to manage and match all of those costs with our revenue trends. But I would say that the uncertainty for the second quarter is just whether or not revenue will continue to accelerate or what we end up seeing if we continue to improve from here, that's going to be an improvement in operating density, and that will drive further improvement in our direct cost performance.\n If you pull our operating ratio in the first quarter apart, I think you may have said it in the inverse, but our direct cost, which are all the costs associated with moving freight, most of which are variable, we're about 53% of revenue. Our overhead costs, which are more fixed in nature, is between 20% to 21% of revenue.\n So those costs are somewhere around $300 million, a little bit higher than that in the first quarter. That $300 million is going to be there in the second quarter and it's probably going to be closer to $305 million, plus or minus. So you've kind of got that base cost to bounce around. But on -- and those being at 20% to 21% to one of your other points, yes, that's been as low as 16% in the past when you're really leveraging up, in particular, all the investments that we've made in capital expenditures and driving improvement there.\n On the direct cost side, though, that 53% just as late as the third quarter of last year, those costs were around 51%. And that was still in a tough operating environment. So we definitely have got further room for improvement from a direct cost basis. And then obviously, there's a lot of leverage there on the overhead side. And those factors are what gives us confidence that we can get the operating ratio back to sub-70.\n But we're not going to make decisions that would help cost in the short run that may jeopardize the opportunity in the long run. The reason we've been able to outgrow our competitors in strong growth periods like 2018, 2021, where our tonnage growth can be 1,000 basis points or more higher than the industry is because of the decisions we make in tougher times.\n We've got the financial strength to be able to invest in service center growth to be able to invest in our equipment to invest in employees and do all the things to be ready for that growth. And that's why oftentimes in those strongest growth periods, we're growing double-digit volumes and a lot of our competitors are flattish in those periods. So all those same strategic advantages, the pre-investment ahead of the growth curve, all of those continue to be in place, and we'll get the most leverage on them when we get into a real accelerating and growth environment again. Look, we're not just sitting back doing nothing. We're fighting every day to get better and working with each one of our customer accounts to make sure that we're in there. We're having conversations about how we're going to be able to grow with them. But we also don't have to feel the need to go out and try to chase volume, which many of competitors have done in the past, and then they get their network full and they're unable to grow.\n So the point that I was making earlier about there's not been as much growth when you look at what has happened sequentially over the last couple of quarters from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.\n I mean, when you look, I see that our share has improved from second quarter to fourth quarter, from third quarter to fourth quarter as well. So we're doing this in an environment that is not creating a lot of freight activity. I think that when we get out of this environment, I think that the time to challenge our model would be if we're in an environment where there is robust economic growth, and we're not able to achieve anything, but we are a long ways from there. Yes. I mean certainly in the past 2 years have felt more like 2009 recession. When you look back last year and see double-digit tonnage in some periods and overall for the year, we were down 9%. It was a very tough operating environment. But again, we continue to try to power through it and position ourselves for future market share opportunities.\n And I think that's what we've done, managing all of our other incremental costs along the way to keep producing what is by far and away the best operating ratio in our industry. And so I think that when you get back to an environment where transportation in general, the truckload market, in particular, has been incredibly weak.\n And I think there has been some spillover of volumes that have gone into that industry, just given the overall weakness there and players that are willing to move freight take some maybe large heavy-weighted LTL shipments for cost or less than their cost to operate just to kind of keep the trucks rolling. That's been another challenge, if you will, that we've had to contend with.\n But that will all change as the economy improves, just like we've seen in prior cycles. And I think that our industry will be tight once again. I continue to believe that despite some other carriers adding service centers that we will be a capacity challenged industry in the future as well.\n And ultimately, all of the service centers and door capacities that existed with Yellow, not 100% of that is going to come back into the market, as we've already seen with the process that it's played out over the last 9 months.\n So those are all things that we think will end up creating opportunities for us, again, and I think that once we have that tailwind coming at us from an overall industry demand standpoint that we'll be able to capitalize and be able to significantly grow our volumes like we've been able to do in the past and then leverage that growth through the operating ratio.\n And if you look back in any period in past, when we've lost the operating ratio in any given year or period and go back to 2009 and look at that, we lost -- the operating ratio deteriorated 270 basis points that year. Once we get the power of leverage in the model, we more than recover anything that we've lost. In that example, in 2010, when things really were robust again, we were able to improve the OR by 360 basis points.\n So I feel like though from getting to the improvement cycle that it feels similar to 2017, where things are kind of on the edge of getting ready to start showing improvement again. And hopefully, we'll continue to see some growth as we go through the middle part of the year, some year-over-year growth and further sequential improvement and then things really start taking off and we'll go from there.\n But that's -- the good thing about our mid-quarter updates is we're going to give it to you as we go along. So you'll see the final April results we'll put in our 10-Q, the final May results from a revenue standpoint will publish. And you'll know it is developing versus me having to look through the crystal ball and predict when we're going to see the big inflection in revenue coming. Yes. I've got a teenage daughter, so I can't help but hear certain types of music in the house. But on the pricing front, we've not really seen any material change in activity or bid activity. And for us, it's pretty consistent through the year in terms of how bids come in. And so pretty much just business as usual there. And again, like we said earlier, continuing to get the same types of increases on a core basis that we've seen in the past. Yes. From a headcount standpoint, I mentioned that we've added about 500 people since September of last year. So I feel like we're in good shape there. The other thing is that we are running our truck driving schools. And so some of the people that we pulled from a platform position and put them into a truck in the fall to respond to that sequential acceleration in business, we've been able to backfill those platforms roles with the hiring, but also have trained more drivers to have those employees and drivers and ready reserve, if you will, to respond to an increase in demand if it continues to accelerate from here. So it's pretty much in balance right now with the change in full-time employees with shipments.\n And that's something that generally is balanced over the long term. But I feel like we try to get a little bit ahead of it, but we're cautiously optimistic about and has been for the last quarter. So that was why we went ahead and tried to invest there in that employee growth, but we'll continue to watch and we're a little bit ahead of it.\n We've got different levers that we can pull if volumes are accelerating to where you don't have to hire on a one-for-one basis with growth. But we're in a good spot. May be kind of flattish from here. But depending on we see further acceleration coming through, say, now to anticipate through September, then that might require some further hiring. But no real immediate need at this point to do anything in a material way. I feel like our employee count is pretty well balanced with the volumes that we're seeing. Maybe Marty will address the service center capacity. Yes. I think that at the end of the day, capacity is not what wins business. It allows you to achieve market share initiatives. So having capacity doesn't necessarily mean that anyone is going to be able to grow, it just gives the ability to grow. Service is ultimately what wins share and relationships in this business as well.\n And I think that we've been able to strengthen our customer relationships over time, our sales and our pricing teams, the relationships that they formed with our customers, the consistency of our business practices, the consistency of our yield management practices as well. All that goes into forming strong bonds between us and our customers.\n And so we continue to look at ways that we can add further value to our customers' supply chains. And we look for ways that we can continue to execute on a continuous improvement process, which is a central element of our foundation for success. So we've got a better service product than anyone else in our industry. We're proud that we've won the Mastio Quality Award for 14 years in a row and the service gap between us and the others actually got wider in last year's analysis.\n So that's something that we remain focused on and keep trying to do things that our customers are asking from us and to be able to deliver that superior service at a fair price to our customers as well. So the competition that is trying to emulate us, I guess that's one to say about imitation being the most sincere form of flattery.\n We'll continue to watch and see what they're doing, but it's something that people have been trying to emulate for years, and we're not sitting still to let someone try to come up and catch us. We're working hard every day to get better to make sure that, that service gap and the overall value gap that we add continues to get wider. I haven't heard anything out of the ordinary, things that we wouldn't normally hear. But the reporting -- we've had some improvement in our -- the national account reporting that we get with wins and losses. And service issues are starting to increase, I would just say, generally. We're starting to see those start to pick up. So just something that's kind of on the press pace of one other item that's kind of changing in our favor. Yes, I think so, Jason, I agree with you. And I felt like post-pandemic, we were going to stay in more of an adjusting case type of inventory management style. But once things get tight and you start managing cost, you have to look at all elements and managing tighter inventory is one way for shippers to improve their overall bottom line.\n And so we've seen that trend kind of work its way back to the JIT. And we've had anecdotal feedback from customers that have come in and visited us as well that may have had elevated inventory levels that they have now worked through. So hopefully, that will be a good thing for us.\n And it generally is, obviously, if you're managing tighter inventory, you've got to rely on a shipper that can deliver on time and without damage. If you don't have excess inventory sitting around, you can't afford to have a shipment come in that's completely damaged and you've got to deal with a return and reorder type of situation.\n And so that has supported our ability to win market share over time. It's something that we think will continue to allow us to win market share as we go forward and it works both with our industrial and our retail customers. But on the retail side, with the on-demand and in full programs that many retailers have put in place to manage their inventory, that's a tremendous opportunity for continued growth in our business as well.\n And we're able to meet the expectations of those retailers and take the vendor-controlled freight and make sure that we hit those delivery windows, and we're doing at 99% of the time and without any type of damage. So we're minimizing in some cases, millions of dollars of chargebacks for retail-related customers that are delivering into those big box retailers with those on-time and full programs in place.\n So a lot of good opportunity when we look down the long-term curve, and it's why we're so confident in our ability to keep winning market share into the future. I feel like we continue to have a long runway for growth. And that's what dictates and determines our capital expenditure program. We look at where we see growth coming from, a lot of that is based on customer conversations that we're having for how their business levels are going to be changing into the future as well and that dictates how we continue to expand out our network.\n So as long as we have line of sight into the next 5 years of growth, and that's generally what we're kind of pre-investing for, we will continue to invest the money into our real estate program and further expand the service center network. But it's all grounded on a line of sight in the market share opportunities. It's not just a build it and hope they come. In terms on a sequential standpoint or... Yes. So far, I mean, obviously, we're not completely done, but we're somewhere around 48,000 shipments per day. So just up slightly from where we were in March. And we'll see hopefully, that will increase a little bit that average count, if you will. But when we look at what normal seasonality, the 10-year average is a 0.4% increase from March into April for shipments.\n But recall that we had a Good Friday is in there in March this year. So in years where that is the case, it would be a 2% increase from March to April. So right now, trending lower than that 2% growth, but when you look back at kind of what we were able to achieve in February and March, again, consistent growth.\n And on the tonnage side, we saw just call it 2% sequential growth from January to February and then about 2.5% from February to March, demonstrating a little bit of pickup in weight per shipment there that kind of help that metric. And that metric was essentially in alignment with the 10-year average or rather the adjusted average that reflects Good Friday being in March.\n So it's good to see that we're finally seeing month-over-month improvement there versus I've mentioned before from April of '22 through December, we were kind of in a declining environment and then just flat from December at 47,000 shipments per day, December '22, all the way to August when we had the big industry event and that acceleration that we saw pretty much a step function change that happened on an immediate basis. Yes. We hope to see it continue to increase. That's typically an indicator of an improving economy as well. Like I mentioned, an increase from February to March, it's increased a little bit from March thus far into April as well. So that's something that we're probably on the low end of the scale in terms of how that metric changes.\n It got a little skewed, if you will, with post Yellow and some of the incremental freight that we saw there. But historically speaking, in a strong demand environment, we've been closer to 1,600 pounds as an overall average. We're still down around 1,515 pounds and so we definitely have got some room to grow there.\n And that, too, creates and that's part of the leverage that you get from an operating ratio standpoint is weight continues to increase, you're getting more revenue per shipment, and that will help overall offset and kind of close that gap that we've seen with cost per shipment over the past years. The call relatively speaking, is -- should be very similar, but you're just getting more weight and more revenue per load, if you will. Yes. Overall, the retail continued to reflect -- or the industrial rather reflect the weakness that we've seen in the industrial economy. And in the first quarter, we had 1% revenue growth, but it was actually a slight decrease when you look at just our industrial-related accounts group together. So a little bit better performance on the retail side to offset that in the first quarter.\n But again, hopefully, that's something now that we've seen ISM trend back above 50%, it had been below 50% for 16 months. I mean just this long, incredibly slow environment that we've been slugging through. But generally speaking, that indicates that improvement in that industrial environment, if we can stay above 50%, it should be coming, and that could be sort of in that May time frame.\n So it's something that we'll continue to watch. But the retail continues to perform. We've also seen an improvement in the business that's managed by third-party logistics companies. And that's kind of in the early stages as well, but seeing some improvement there. I think is a good sign. Oftentimes, the 3PLs that have the systems, they're able to identify some of those top-off shipments that Marty was referencing earlier by being able to look through their entire inventory of capacity versus shipments.\n And so if we're starting to see some growth there again with those and maybe some of that type of truck versus LTL swing might start reversing course. But again, I think it's just a lot of things are kind of in the early stages that we got to keep watch on and I don't want to get overly caught up in and -- but keep our fingers on the pulse, if you will, and continue to watch the trends and see if it manifests into increased LTL demand overall for which I think that we will more than be able to win our share. Yes. And again, to repeat, nothing is changing with respect to the core contract increases that we're achieving and that we're targeting. We continue to target cost plus increases, and we're getting those. It's just a little bit different in the mix of freight that we're seeing. We've seen a little bit of a decrease in length of haul.\n Some change in increase in weight per shipment, like I mentioned, all those factors kind of lead to a lower revenue per hundredweight. So just looking at things on a pure per hundredweight basis, it's gone from, just call it, 6.5% growth in the first quarter to 4.5% excluding fuel so far in April.\n But we've said before, hundredweight can move around quickly, and that's why internally, we focus more on revenue per shipment than anything. That's what we pick up every day, our shipments, and that's what we've got to figure out what's the cost to pick up a shipment. What's the cost of line haul a shipment, cross-docket. Everything that we do is driven on a per shipment basis.\n And I mean I think we can get back to having a positive spread of revenue per shipment versus our cost per shipment performance. So that will continue to be the initiative. I don't see anything changing with respect to the pricing environment and nothing changing that we've seen as we've gone through renewals and bids and so forth with respect to the other carriers in the industry.\n And obviously, we'll see with their reports when they come out. But we've not seen anything change in that regard. It's just some mix changes that are impacting our revenue per hundredweight metrics thus far into April. No, but it's staying consistent with where we were. The rev per shipment performance in April thus far is pretty consistent with what we just had in the first quarter. We were up 3.8% revenue per shipment in the first quarter, excluding the fuel surcharge. Well, I think that's something that obviously depending on how much volume growth we actually see in the quarter or not sequentially. We've invested significantly in many factors that we detailed earlier that create short-term costs. So if we can see some further improvement and if weight and shipments really accelerate kind of from here forward, and obviously, there's a lot of leverage that would therefore come from that.\n But that's something that if we're -- if we continue to grow revenue, it's kind of a 6% year-over-year rate like we saw in April, then we tried to give a factor of, okay, maybe we'll only see 150 basis points of sequential improvement, which would still be a year-over-year improvement where we were in the second quarter last year.\n But I think it's just going to move on a sliding scale, if you will, based on how much revenue comes in. And typically, like I mentioned, the revenue growth is between 8.5% and 9% to 8.7% from the first quarter to the second quarter. And we're just not there yet. And hopefully, we see further sequential improvement in May and June. And obviously, we give those -- we'll give the update for May, with our mid-quarter update as we go along.\n But the improvement that we see in the operating ratio is typically 350 to 400 basis points of improvement. A lot of that improvement comes by way of the direct costs. It's mainly the salaries, wages and benefits and are op supplies and expenses, and that's coming from the improvement in operating density and taking advantage of all that incremental freight that's moving through the system.\n So if all those things do develop, then obviously, we can produce further improvement in those direct costs. And like I mentioned earlier, from a headcount standpoint, I feel good about where we are. So it's not like we've got to scale up even more in terms of our hiring practices. But we'll probably be working more hours and doing things like that with the existing workforce. So there's opportunity to scale there. But like any other period, it's just going to be top line dependent for how much growth do we see and how much of that incremental growth will be able to put to the bottom line. Yes. I don't have my Carnac the Magnificent happier handy to be able to predict on when things are going to change, but that's probably the most buzziest thing is when will the inflection point happen. We -- obviously, it's called a cycle for a reason, and we will get back into a robust demand environment at some point. And when we do, we will be able to take advantage of that.\n And we've built the company up. We've been growing our company for years and continue to believe that we've got a lot of growth opportunity as we look out into the future. So obviously, we put on a lot of growth. We're able to grow our revenues, $1 billion in each of 2021 and 2022 and then ran into the slowdown in the economy.\n So we've been making our way through that very well, very proud of the operating ratio that we were able to produce last year in a challenging environment. And we're still in an environment that we're not out of the woods yet, if you will. We still had in the first quarter, a 3% reduction in tons per day and essentially had a flat operating ratio, but we're able to produce positive earnings per share as well.\n So I feel good about the base level of operations where we are today and being able to build on what we've established. So there's a long runway for growth out there when it comes to a top line standpoint that we believe for our business. And we've got further room to improve our operating ratio as well. And so that will allow us to achieve our vision of achieving long-term profitable growth that drives an increase in shareholder value.\n So all those same elements are in place. There may be some different logos that have been moving around on service centers and different customers, given all the disruption that's taken place over the last 6 to 9 months. But OD stands ready, and we'll continue to add value to our customer supply chains and we feel like we'll be able to drive significant growth in our business as we go forward. And that's a great observation."
