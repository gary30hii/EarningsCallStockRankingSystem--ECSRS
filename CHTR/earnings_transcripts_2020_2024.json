I'd now like to turn the call over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter's fourth quarter 2020 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.\nThomas Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. 2020 was an unusual year, but it demonstrated and enhanced the strength of our business and we performed better than expected in a number of areas. The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide and our robust network handled immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and tele-health services. Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at Charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016 and it showed up in our 2020 performance. For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5% and we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%. Our residential business performed particularly well with strength in Internet and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business given the quality and value of our product. Despite the outsized growth and some pull-forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward, our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet net adds that we achieved in 2019. We believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. Due to significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full-year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, set up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Looking at Slide 6, including Residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down 93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter because our first three quarters of this year were above last year's first three quarters by 900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by 2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis. The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to Charter earlier in the year plus lower market churn resulting in fewer selling opportunities, drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Trends have been improving more recently in subject to COVID and economic developments. We currently expect full-year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019. Residential and SMB video customers declined by 35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by 5 -- 56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by 103,000 in the quarter by 148,000 for the full year. Mobile line net adds grew by 315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels. The lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely and we're not giving away free handsets to do it. For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines and we believe we were the fastest growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Turning to Slide 7, fourth-quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6% excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3% excluding political. Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that were no longer isolating cable specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics. But we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021.\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two quick questions if I may, Chris. First, you finished off by saying that 2022 could be the year you deliver the performance you expected in 2020. Can you remind us what you're anticipating in 2020 in terms of financial performance? And then, with the CBRS deployments kicking in, it sounds like from the pacing of CapEx that lot of the deployment will happen perhaps towards the end of 2020, how do you expect that to impact wireless margins -- sorry, the deployment happen towards the end of 2021, how do you expect that to impact wireless margins in 2022? What could the wireless margin for the -- the margin for the wireless business look like once the CBRS is fully deployed?\nChris Winfrey: So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net add -- additions relative to 2019 and a political advertising year, which indeed we had, and the continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions, increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened at some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult and put pressure on the financial, some of which was artificially good. And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we had around political advertising, there's a lot of detail there and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. And then, when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have -- depending how this year goes as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, you should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost to service remain, in fact it maybe even accelerated to COVID. We will have another political advertising year in 2022 and -- so, I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out given what uncertainty is still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year and I think 2022 will be the new -- even cleaner year, really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multi-year operating model deployment. And the CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about the mobile CapEx for this year. And it's just going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned, in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI based deployment of the radio access networks that are really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost and we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins. And the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021.\nThomas Rutledge: I would just add to that. The returns on CBRS deployment after 2021 really, obviously, will be specific to the demand utilization in the location where the radios are placed. And so to some -- in a complete sense, it's an opportunistic strategy, wherever our cost would be lower by investing in more CBRS radio deployment, our cost will go down in such a way that we'll get a return on investment. And I guess, just to sort of fill out Chris' response on trends, if you think about the long-run trend that we've been on of an accelerating growth rate in terms of a broadband growth, that trend is still in place and it exists for '19, '20, '21, and we think as well into 2022. And what's really happened as you got a lot of noise in the '20 and '21 P&Ls, but the net of all of it is, if you spread it out over a multi-year period, is that the trend continues, but we have 800,000 more Internet customers than we would have otherwise.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, we're ready for the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. So, Chris, I just wanted to come back to broadband numbers. Obviously, your wireless attachment to broadband historically has been, I think, 70% to 90%. This quarter, it's like 145%. And I think you mentioned that churns you got was low, did 4Q see elevated churn in broadband tied to Keep America Connected? And how much of that 600,000, I think, cohort is still sort of in the system and needs to be sort of plans  out, any thoughts on that? And then, obviously your video subs in 2020 were pretty good and I think you've sort of used some of your flex on your carriage minimums on your lower-tier offer, can you just talk about, is that a trend we should continue to see in '21 or are we sort of saturated that opportunity given how much you've done on those lower-tier video? Thank you.\nThomas Rutledge: So Vijay, let me answer the trend question and the Keep American Connected and the REO effect and whether that's in or out of the system, I think that's the thrust of your question. I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and therefore pushed net gain up forward. And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program and therefore there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales. But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019. And we see that already in our performance so far through 2020 -- through the date of today in 2021.\nVijay Jayant: And then on video trend?\nThomas Rutledge: Oh, video. Yeah, I'm sorry. We had good results in video for two reasons. One, we had outsized growth in connectivity and as a result of that, by having market share shift to us from other video providers as they bought our broadband, we grew our video against a macro trend of declining multichannel video growth. And that macro trend hasn't gone away and I expect in general, video growth for the industry will continue to decline maybe at a moderate pace. And I don't think we'll have quite the Internet growth, that we had in 2020, in 2021. So I think that just that fact alone is going to put more pressure on our video growth going forward. But on the other hand, we've been able to grow with OTT products in smaller packages and we still have opportunities there and we're forecasting our internal growth in those areas to continue to accelerate and so the net of those two things is difficult to say, but I think we'll do better than the industry in general if you just look at multichannel video growth, whether that will be positive or negative I'm not sure.\nVijay Jayant: Got it.\nChris Winfrey: Vijay, I think you go back and take a look at what both Tom and I said, not just now in the Q&A, but also in the prepared remarks. But to just list them out in the Q4 impacts for broadband and relationships. One, we had some pull forward of sales that we've talked about earlier in the year. Two, there was less market churn that drives lower sales funnel, particularly for a share taker like us that has an impact. And three, the nuance that time was going through is that the Keep Americans Connected customers meant we kept those subs already in Q2 and Q3, which was helpful to our net adds, but the subs had -- might have turned around and reconnected in Q4 as a sale opportunity. We had already retained them to their stock and so they didn't turn into a quote-unquote sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced and those three reasons are the big drivers in what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like 2019.\nVijay Jayant: Great, thanks.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, we'll take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yeah, thanks. Just some points of clarification around just the answer you just gave before. It sounds like all of the churn that you might have experienced from Keep America Connected and other payment plans, were sort of addressed prior to the fourth quarter. So the first question is, was there any residual churn from that customer base in the fourth quarter or do you feel like you have just gotten to a normalized churn rate? And then, you talked about lower overall churn in the market, I was hoping to get your thoughts on that. Do you think this has to do with lockdowns or anything that was COVID related? And are you seeing so far this year, admittedly early in this year, evidence that market behavior is returning to normal? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: So when we talk about the Keep Americans Connected churn and the Remote Education Offer, that tackle both of those at the same time. The Remote Education Offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisition. So that had been the case earlier in the year, that continue to be the case for Q4 and for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently. The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote-off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state and they've been paying. And they've been retained as customers and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher non pay rate than your average customer base, you would expect that, because of where they came from. But it's actually really good and it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching this payment trends release since July or August, when we started that program to reset the receivables, we don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers, they always were. And I think we did the right thing to put them back into current receivable state. And the lower overall market churn and really the two big driver -- three drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall people's account balances are high, they don't have places to spend money. And because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. And as our payment profile for customers is good, it's better than it's ever been. And that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. So non-pay disconnect for the marketplace is at record lows. Mover churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people are  to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down across the market we believe as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers. We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal is not, by any means, normal. And which is why I said, our outlook for 2021 on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook and I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparisons. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21 will look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity and I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you for that color.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Brett. James, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. Two questions if I could. First, I just want to step back from the broadband conversation for a moment. You've historically said that your preference is to keep prices low and to try to grow quickly particularly when the opportunity for this kind of breakneck growth of 2020 was available. Is there any consideration now that growth is returning to a more normal pace, that it might be time to perhaps be a little more reliant on price as most of the peers are in the industry and optimizing total revenue growth? And then second, if I could return to the conversation on CBRS small cells, maybe we can just think about it in terms of an objective for how much traffic you think you might be able to offload from the variablized MVNO traffic to what you could eventually put over, just the CBRS portion, not so much WiFi, but just the CBRS portion out of home?\nThomas Rutledge: Well, Craig, Tom here. We have had outsized growth and I don't think any broadband provider in America connected any -- has more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021 actually because of the opportunity and because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do a data only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 and our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us. With regard to CBRS and how much traffic we can unload, I think that's a through time kind of question I think over the long haul, meaning four, five years. It could be up to a third of our traffic that's current -- that would currently beyond an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic, depends on traffic flows, depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs, but it is necessary. And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there is a mixture between Wi-Fi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works. That's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on WiFi. And, as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company if you really think about it. We have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool along with WiFi for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as an incremental opportunity from a return on investment point of view to move traffic onto our network, but it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy.\nCraig Moffett: Makes sense.\nStefan Anninger: James, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you so much. Couple of questions. I just wanted to follow the wireless threat here a little bit. Pretty interesting comments there, Tom and Chris said earlier, we're not giving away free phones to get a kick hit the wireless net adds. Is there a business model where at some point you makes sense to do so? I would think from an MVNO standpoint, just selling in -- just go into service in the new broadband subs, runs out of gas at some penetration level. It might last quite a while, it might be a profitable business for you. But is, I don't know, the updated MVNO with Verizon puts you in a position with different economics of offloading through your wireless traffic, puts you in different economics? Is there a point where you can get more aggressive going after customers relative to what the big peer doing? And then separately, I saw your marketing spend was up 1%, but the connects were down and you indicated the 4Q environment was still pretty light, if you could just talk about your marketing strategy and how that might evolve in 2021 that would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: I'd start off with the wireless business model as a standalone business model. We've always said, we don't think it's very good. And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can afford it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide today, the 80% of traffic -- mobile traffic that's already carried over our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection -- a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration. Today our goal is not to use -- we think there is so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have, there is not a need to go subsidize the handset. The handsets have a longer life now than they have in the past. So, we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. We don't think that in and of itself is a great business model. And the marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter. Just because sales were lower, doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continue to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connection side at the quarter.\nThomas Rutledge: We're still higher than quarter-over-quarter, kind of fourth quarter over last year's fourth quarter.\nChris Winfrey: Yes.\nDoug Mitchelson: And is there anything new or different you would expect to do as the market normalizes in 2021 relative to your behavior in 2020 and other different channels or different prices? Or the model is working and it's steady as it goes?\nThomas Rutledge: It's working very nicely for us. Our sales yield, as we look at it, which is the amount of sales that we make per available transaction, continues to improve and our whole opportunity structure around selling mobile connections continues to improve. We have -- even during the pandemic, we managed to build 180 new stores in 2020 and we expect to finish off our store construction in '21. So we'll have a fully deployed walk-in retail environment, which is not yet fully realized. So we would expect that would have an impact on our growth rate in 2021 in a positive way. Our yield, meaning the amount of mobile connections that we sell as a percentage of every person who enters one of our stores, continues to go up. And the same is true of every phone call we receive through our call centers. And as a result of that, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the business the way it's currently structured inside of our pricing and marketing machine.\nDoug Mitchelson: Last one, how many stores that in 2021 are left to build?\nThomas Rutledge: I'm not sure, but I think we end up with 750.\nChris Winfrey: I think it's couple hundred -- 180, 200, that's my recollection.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you all so much.\nStefan Anninger: James, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nPhilip Cusick: Hey guys, thanks. I understand you're still restricted on RDOF, but you called out the extensions to rural markets in your penetration -- or in your presentation. Can you confirm that the steady CapEx intensity guide includes anything you might do in rural? And should we expect to see a step change in line extension CapEx as you push harder on those new home build-outs, both brownfield and greenfield? And then any change we should expect next year as rural maybe becomes more important?\nChris Winfrey: So, Phil, the capital intensity outlook that I gave did not -- on one hand did not include any incremental amount for RDOF. On the other hand, I'm not sure given the amount of planning work and we're  going to need to stand up this year, I don't know that it's going to be that material this year anyway would be at the back end of this year. As you look out -- and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There is pushes between different years in 2020. We delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect. So, there will be overtime things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or a different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track. But the reality is core cable capital intensity is a percentage of revenue. The trend is on the decline and nothing is really changed. And to the extent that we have RDOF spend or CBRS spend, we're going to isolate that for the market to be able to have clear visibility as to not only what we're spending, but what we think we're getting out of those projects as well.\nPhilip Cusick: Thanks, Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. James, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. Tom, I wanted to come back to your comments on video in '21 and I guess beyond. I think you talked about -- I think it was either you or Chris talking about streaming apps on WorldBox and sort of accelerating those trends. What is -- how would you describe your video strategy sitting here today? Any sense of how big the WorldBox kind of installed basis? And is this a strategy that could be relevant for broadband-only customers over time?\nThomas Rutledge: Yes. The answer is yes. It can be. So our video strategy is to continue, obviously, to sell the products that we have historically sold and to sell them with a reasonable margin attached to them and to make money with them, but to also include them as part of our overall connectivity relationship with our customer base in a way that allows us to satisfy the needs of as many customers as possible as a result of our network. And that includes the addition of new video tiers or products that may be skinnier or differentiated or targeted in a way that they create customer satisfaction at reasonable price because of the long-run price trend of the core video product continues to be negative, meaning it is -- programming cost continue to go up. And that's obviously creating a lot of the friction in the marketplace and the decline of that business. We also think that we want to have a transactional marketplace on a consumer-friendly interface, so that a customer of ours have access to all the products they may want to buy that are direct to consumer. And there is an opportunity for us in that as well to be sellers of that and to operate a store -- a consignment store and to create value for us and customers through that mechanism. WorldBox is deployed, I'm not sure what the full count is of --\nChris Winfrey: Several  million.\nThomas Rutledge: Yeah, it's millions -- multiple millions of households. And those WorldBox's deployed and those on the increment have an app store in them -- or an app section in them now where we can place the products that people want to get on the same set-top box as our traditional cable TV services. And in addition to that, we have the opportunity to offer an app-based platform to our data only customers. And we haven't offered that IP only app product, although we've opened up some of our video products through apps to our Internet only customer base like our news channels for instance. So that opportunity is in front of us as well. And -- but ultimately, I expect that all of our customers will have opportunities to transact with us in a video marketplace.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. James, we'll take our last question, please.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. Chris, I wanted to ask you, how are you now thinking about where you want to be ideally within your target leverage range and unrelated topic? Would you expect the pace of share repurchases to be similar, more or less in '21 versus '20? And then lastly, if the corporate tax rate does increase back to 28% for the 2022 tax year and beyond, would that change the way you think about the target leverage ratio? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: So, Bryan, the target leverage range, we're comfortable in the 4 to 4.5 times. We've been at the high end of that range on a consolidated basis and declining in that range on a cable only basis depending on how you want to look at it, you can pick which one you think is more relevant. But we're comfortable inside the range. We don't have any plans to change that target leverage range. That would include us the tax rate next year where to go up. We've been in that tax rate before, admittedly within well , which will be expiring. But given the strength of cash flow -- subscriber growth and cash flow and the business performance and the sustainability of not only the operating model, but the balance sheet structure that we have, it's pretty unique. I don't see any reason at this stage, as we sit here today, that we would be changing our target leverage range. On buybacks, we never give guidance and the reason for that is to make sure that management and the Board were not in a position where we feel like we're going to be handcuffed based on previous comments in terms of creating shareholder value. And so we want to retain flexibility as it relates to investing in high ROI projects inside the business, first-quarter  call, doing attractive M&A. And to the extent that we don't have somebody else's stock to buy that's better than buying our own stock or do buybacks, which is what we've been doing in the past several years in addition to launching some really high ROI projects and spending on those where they're available. Right now, I don't see any massive change to what we're doing as it relates to our overall capital structure or buybacks, but I'm not going to sit here and give an outlook or guidance as it relates to buybacks for the year for all those reasons.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Thank you for the clarification. Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Bryan.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Bryan. And thanks, everyone. That concludes our call.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you, everyone.\nThomas Rutledge: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. 2020 was an unusual year, but it demonstrated and enhanced the strength of our business and we performed better than expected in a number of areas. The past year has also highlighted the importance of the services we provide and our robust network handled immediate conversion to a remote-based economy, enabling work from home, remote education and tele-health services. Over the last 10 months, our broadband infrastructure was tested and performed very well. That's because at Charter, we've spent over $35 billion on our network and infrastructure since the close of our transactions in 2016 and it showed up in our 2020 performance. For the full year 2020, we added 1.9 million new customer relationships for growth of 6.5% and we added 2.2 million new Internet customers for growth of 8.3%. We also performed well financially. We grew our adjusted EBITDA by 10% and our free cash flow by 53%. Our residential business performed particularly well with strength in Internet and we -- where we added 800,000 more customers than we did the prior year. We remain very optimistic about our opportunity to grow our Internet business given the quality and value of our product. Despite the outsized growth and some pull-forward of demand into 2020, which will drive continued benefits to our revenue and EBITDA going forward, our expectation and plan for 2021 is to revert to the trend we were on pre-COVID and meet or exceed the customer relationship and Internet net adds that we achieved in 2019. We believe our long-term broadband penetration and market position has actually been enhanced. I would just add to that. The returns on CBRS deployment after 2021 really, obviously, will be specific to the demand utilization in the location where the radios are placed. And so to some -- in a complete sense, it's an opportunistic strategy, wherever our cost would be lower by investing in more CBRS radio deployment, our cost will go down in such a way that we'll get a return on investment. And I guess, just to sort of fill out Chris' response on trends, if you think about the long-run trend that we've been on of an accelerating growth rate in terms of a broadband growth, that trend is still in place and it exists for '19, '20, '21, and we think as well into 2022. And what's really happened as you got a lot of noise in the '20 and '21 P&Ls, but the net of all of it is, if you spread it out over a multi-year period, is that the trend continues, but we have 800,000 more Internet customers than we would have otherwise. So Vijay, let me answer the trend question and the Keep American Connected and the REO effect and whether that's in or out of the system, I think that's the thrust of your question. I think the REO pulled demand forward from an acquisition point of view. And the Keep America Connected pulled reduced churn forward and therefore pushed net gain up forward. And if you think about the way churn works, if you have more disconnects, you have more connects to keep the same growth, just keep the same net adds. And so there is less net adds in the fourth quarter because those net adds were pulled forward by the Keep America Connected program and therefore there was less activity in the fourth quarter as a result of the normal way that churn interacts with sales. But as we look at '21 and look at how our sales have returned and we look at the behavior of our customers, we think that the effects of all of that are pretty much out of our numbers already. And we expect to return to a more normal kind of connect and disconnect rate and a more normal net adds rate that's consistent with the kinds of growth rates that we had in 2019. And we see that already in our performance so far through 2020 -- through the date of today in 2021. Oh, video. Yeah, I'm sorry. We had good results in video for two reasons. One, we had outsized growth in connectivity and as a result of that, by having market share shift to us from other video providers as they bought our broadband, we grew our video against a macro trend of declining multichannel video growth. And that macro trend hasn't gone away and I expect in general, video growth for the industry will continue to decline maybe at a moderate pace. And I don't think we'll have quite the Internet growth, that we had in 2020, in 2021. So I think that just that fact alone is going to put more pressure on our video growth going forward. But on the other hand, we've been able to grow with OTT products in smaller packages and we still have opportunities there and we're forecasting our internal growth in those areas to continue to accelerate and so the net of those two things is difficult to say, but I think we'll do better than the industry in general if you just look at multichannel video growth, whether that will be positive or negative I'm not sure. Well, Craig, Tom here. We have had outsized growth and I don't think any broadband provider in America connected any -- has more net gain than Charter. So I think our strategy in terms of pricing and packaging has worked in terms of growth. And we deferred a rate that we had planned in 2021 actually because of the opportunity and because of the social circumstance and our obligation during that social circumstance. So we did do a data only rate increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 and our relative prices compared to our competitors and compared to our peers is still situationally gives us an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. So we'll evaluate that through time, but we like the model we have and we think there's a lot of growth in front of us. With regard to CBRS and how much traffic we can unload, I think that's a through time kind of question I think over the long haul, meaning four, five years. It could be up to a third of our traffic that's current -- that would currently beyond an MVNO kind of basis. But again, that's not -- that's opportunistic, depends on traffic flows, depends on the quantity of flows and where they are and whether it pays for us to put out the capital to reduce those costs, but it is necessary. And if you think through our WiFi deployment as well, there is a mixture between Wi-Fi and CBRS in terms of offload and how that works. That's not that easy to forecast. But 80% of all mobile traffic today is on WiFi -- of mobile traffic -- mobile device traffic is on WiFi. And, as a result of that, we are the wireless connectivity company if you really think about it. We have 400 million wireless devices connected to our network. And CBRS is just a tool along with WiFi for us to improve that connectivity experience. And it's not -- as that happens, we've looked at CBRS strictly as an incremental opportunity from a return on investment point of view to move traffic onto our network, but it also does have the potential of increasing the consumers' experience in terms of their satisfaction because of the quality of that connection. And so that's sort of an unstated opportunity going forward, hard to quantify, but part of our strategy. We're still higher than quarter-over-quarter, kind of fourth quarter over last year's fourth quarter. It's working very nicely for us. Our sales yield, as we look at it, which is the amount of sales that we make per available transaction, continues to improve and our whole opportunity structure around selling mobile connections continues to improve. We have -- even during the pandemic, we managed to build 180 new stores in 2020 and we expect to finish off our store construction in '21. So we'll have a fully deployed walk-in retail environment, which is not yet fully realized. So we would expect that would have an impact on our growth rate in 2021 in a positive way. Our yield, meaning the amount of mobile connections that we sell as a percentage of every person who enters one of our stores, continues to go up. And the same is true of every phone call we receive through our call centers. And as a result of that, we're pretty optimistic about our ability to continue to grow the business the way it's currently structured inside of our pricing and marketing machine. I'm not sure, but I think we end up with 750. Yes. The answer is yes. It can be. So our video strategy is to continue, obviously, to sell the products that we have historically sold and to sell them with a reasonable margin attached to them and to make money with them, but to also include them as part of our overall connectivity relationship with our customer base in a way that allows us to satisfy the needs of as many customers as possible as a result of our network. And that includes the addition of new video tiers or products that may be skinnier or differentiated or targeted in a way that they create customer satisfaction at reasonable price because of the long-run price trend of the core video product continues to be negative, meaning it is -- programming cost continue to go up. And that's obviously creating a lot of the friction in the marketplace and the decline of that business. We also think that we want to have a transactional marketplace on a consumer-friendly interface, so that a customer of ours have access to all the products they may want to buy that are direct to consumer. And there is an opportunity for us in that as well to be sellers of that and to operate a store -- a consignment store and to create value for us and customers through that mechanism. WorldBox is deployed, I'm not sure what the full count is of -- Yeah, it's millions -- multiple millions of households. And those WorldBox's deployed and those on the increment have an app store in them -- or an app section in them now where we can place the products that people want to get on the same set-top box as our traditional cable TV services. And in addition to that, we have the opportunity to offer an app-based platform to our data only customers. And we haven't offered that IP only app product, although we've opened up some of our video products through apps to our Internet only customer base like our news channels for instance. So that opportunity is in front of us as well. And -- but ultimately, I expect that all of our customers will have opportunities to transact with us in a video marketplace. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Due to significant timing impacts of COVID and the different quarterly reporting methodologies for COVID programs across the industry, our customer and financial results on a full-year basis is the better overview. So I'll give a brief readout of the fourth quarter and then I'll discuss our very good 2020 results, set up 2021 and where that leaves us in 2022. Looking at Slide 6, including Residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 246,000 in the fourth quarter. Internet net adds were down 93,000 versus last year's fourth quarter because our first three quarters of this year were above last year's first three quarters by 900,000 net adds. For the full year, we grew our Internet customers by 2.2 million or by 8.3%, our highest ever on an absolute basis. The significant creation of new broadband customers and shifts from competitors to Charter earlier in the year plus lower market churn resulting in fewer selling opportunities, drove lower net adds in the fourth quarter when compared to last year. Trends have been improving more recently in subject to COVID and economic developments. We currently expect full-year 2021 customer relationship and Internet net adds to meet or exceed 2019. Residential and SMB video customers declined by 35,000 in the fourth quarter, but grew by 5 -- 56,000 or 0.3% for the full year. Voice customers declined by 103,000 in the quarter by 148,000 for the full year. Mobile line net adds grew by 315,000 during the quarter, more than last year's fourth quarter. Our yield on mobile sales opportunities continues to improve across our channels. The lower sequential net additions reflects the lower fourth quarter cable sales I just mentioned. So we're growing mobile nicely and we're not giving away free handsets to do it. For the full year, we added 1.3 million mobile lines and we believe we were the fastest growing mobile operator in our footprint during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Turning to Slide 7, fourth-quarter revenue increased by 7.3% year-over-year or 5.6% excluding political advertising. Full year revenue grew by 5.1% or 4.3% excluding political. Fourth quarter EBITDA, as shown on Slide 8, increased by 10.2% year-over-year and 9.9% for the full year. You'll notice in today's materials that were no longer isolating cable specific revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow metrics. But we will continue to isolate mobile revenue, expenses, working capital and CapEx for investors through 2021. So the first question was what we were expecting in 2020. Well, the trends were that we were expecting in 2020 were an acceleration of customer and Internet net add -- additions relative to 2019 and a political advertising year, which indeed we had, and the continued benefits of our service model driving lower transactions, increasing the underlying profitability of the services by providing great customer service, all of which actually happened at some to different degrees. But we had a tremendous amount of other unrelated noise that was in the system for 2020, some of which was difficult and put pressure on the financial, some of which was artificially good. And in 2021, what we will have is the reversal of many of those trends, good and bad. And so it's just going to create a whole bunch of noise inside of 2021, including the pressure around political advertising. And I think if you use the schedule that we've provided on 2019 and the previous disclosure we had around political advertising, there's a lot of detail there and it will require some work. But I think it puts everybody in a position to really understand how 2021 will develop. And then, when you get into 2022, you really won't have -- you shouldn't have -- depending how this year goes as I mentioned, you shouldn't have any of that noise, you should continue to have really good momentum in the marketplace. All of the underlying trends around cost to service remain, in fact it maybe even accelerated to COVID. We will have another political advertising year in 2022 and -- so, I don't want to get over our skis about looking that far out given what uncertainty is still in front of us. And -- but I think 2021 will still be a good year and I think 2022 will be the new -- even cleaner year, really demonstrate everything that's really happening behind the curtains at Charter and its multi-year operating model deployment. And the CBRS deployment in 2021, it's captured in what I talked about the mobile CapEx for this year. And it's just going to be pretty small, in line with what Tom mentioned, in terms of what we're looking to achieve this year. As it relates to 2022, as we scale the ROI based deployment of the radio access networks that are really just be based on the achievement of lower operating cost and we expect the paybacks on that to be relatively quick. But it will still be fairly de minimis in terms of its overall impact both on CapEx in the grand scheme of things as well as the wireless margins. And the pace of that rollout will really be dictated based on how quickly we can go and how quickly we can realize those type of returns. So it's a little early to outline that fully. I don't think it's going to have a material impact either way inside of 2021. Vijay, I think you go back and take a look at what both Tom and I said, not just now in the Q&A, but also in the prepared remarks. But to just list them out in the Q4 impacts for broadband and relationships. One, we had some pull forward of sales that we've talked about earlier in the year. Two, there was less market churn that drives lower sales funnel, particularly for a share taker like us that has an impact. And three, the nuance that time was going through is that the Keep Americans Connected customers meant we kept those subs already in Q2 and Q3, which was helpful to our net adds, but the subs had -- might have turned around and reconnected in Q4 as a sale opportunity. We had already retained them to their stock and so they didn't turn into a quote-unquote sales or net add opportunity inside the fourth quarter. The last one is true but nuanced and those three reasons are the big drivers in what gives us confidence around us returning back to more like 2019. So when we talk about the Keep Americans Connected churn and the Remote Education Offer, that tackle both of those at the same time. The Remote Education Offer, the retention of those customers very much look like normal acquisition. So that had been the case earlier in the year, that continue to be the case for Q4 and for all the obvious reasons, we've been tracking that very diligently. The Keep Americans Connected customers who -- where we wrote-off significant portions of their balance, put them back into a current state and they've been paying. And they've been retained as customers and they've been paying much better than we expected. They have a slightly higher non pay rate than your average customer base, you would expect that, because of where they came from. But it's actually really good and it's only a few percentage points difference of overall retention. So that was not a driver inside of Q4. And because we've been watching this payment trends release since July or August, when we started that program to reset the receivables, we don't see that raising its head now or in the future. So those are good customers, they always were. And I think we did the right thing to put them back into current receivable state. And the lower overall market churn and really the two big driver -- three drivers there. One is that because stimulus has been on and off, but overall people's account balances are high, they don't have places to spend money. And because of the importance of the services that we provide, we've been paid. And as our payment profile for customers is good, it's better than it's ever been. And that applies to probably anybody inside the broadband and probably video space right now. So non-pay disconnect for the marketplace is at record lows. Mover churn is down significantly. So there's not a lot of movers in the market now. And people are  to have people in their homes switching out their services. So general voluntary churn tends to be down across the market we believe as well. So that lower overall market churn drives less selling opportunities for a share taker like us, which has an impact on your ability to sell and to bring on new customers. We have started to see transaction activity start to return to normal is not, by any means, normal. And which is why I said, our outlook for 2021 on net adds and for Internet and customer relationships really is a full year outlook and I would not get too tied up at all as it relates to quarter-by-quarter comparisons. That's not what we're talking about. And the beginning of '21 will look more like 2020 in terms of customer activity and I think normalization takes place progressively over the course of the year. I'd start off with the wireless business model as a standalone business model. We've always said, we don't think it's very good. And that includes the subsidy of handsets and something that we're not huge fans of if we can afford it. The real value to Charter is to increase the overall connectivity of the service we already provide today, the 80% of traffic -- mobile traffic that's already carried over our network and to extend our reach with Internet and our connectivity and have the opportunity to provide customers a broadband and a wireless connection -- a mobile connection at a cheaper price than they usually pay for in the household for just mobile alone. And that's a way for us to drive connectivity penetration. Today our goal is not to use -- we think there is so much value in the mobile and broadband combined offer that we have, there is not a need to go subsidize the handset. The handsets have a longer life now than they have in the past. So, we'd like to avoid that for all the obvious reasons. Does that mean over time that could evolve? It could, given the value that we create through that customer relationship, but it's not a focus for us. We don't think that in and of itself is a great business model. And the marketing and sales tied to the lower sales inside of the fourth quarter. Just because sales were lower, doesn't mean that we weren't trying to acquire more. And so we were active in the marketplace. We didn't pull back. And so we continue to spend a pretty similar amount of marketing and sales dollars despite the fact that we had lower connection side at the quarter. Yes. I think it's couple hundred -- 180, 200, that's my recollection. So, Phil, the capital intensity outlook that I gave did not -- on one hand did not include any incremental amount for RDOF. On the other hand, I'm not sure given the amount of planning work and we're  going to need to stand up this year, I don't know that it's going to be that material this year anyway would be at the back end of this year. As you look out -- and generally, our core cable capital intensity is continuing to decline. There is pushes between different years in 2020. We delayed certain network projects to be able to accommodate the significant amount of scalable infrastructure spend to accommodate the significant traffic increase. And to some extent, in 2021, we're addressing those projects that were delayed out of 2020 and continuing because of the high traffic demand to spend more an outsized amount on node splitting and different traffic capacity expenditure in '21 that we would normally expect. So, there will be overtime things like RDOF or CBRS deployment or a different levels of DOCSIS 3.1 or DOCSIS 4.0 deployment that may knock us temporarily off our track. But the reality is core cable capital intensity is a percentage of revenue. The trend is on the decline and nothing is really changed. And to the extent that we have RDOF spend or CBRS spend, we're going to isolate that for the market to be able to have clear visibility as to not only what we're spending, but what we think we're getting out of those projects as well. Several  million. So, Bryan, the target leverage range, we're comfortable in the 4 to 4.5 times. We've been at the high end of that range on a consolidated basis and declining in that range on a cable only basis depending on how you want to look at it, you can pick which one you think is more relevant. But we're comfortable inside the range. We don't have any plans to change that target leverage range. That would include us the tax rate next year where to go up. We've been in that tax rate before, admittedly within well , which will be expiring. But given the strength of cash flow -- subscriber growth and cash flow and the business performance and the sustainability of not only the operating model, but the balance sheet structure that we have, it's pretty unique. I don't see any reason at this stage, as we sit here today, that we would be changing our target leverage range. On buybacks, we never give guidance and the reason for that is to make sure that management and the Board were not in a position where we feel like we're going to be handcuffed based on previous comments in terms of creating shareholder value. And so we want to retain flexibility as it relates to investing in high ROI projects inside the business, first-quarter  call, doing attractive M&A. And to the extent that we don't have somebody else's stock to buy that's better than buying our own stock or do buybacks, which is what we've been doing in the past several years in addition to launching some really high ROI projects and spending on those where they're available. Right now, I don't see any massive change to what we're doing as it relates to our overall capital structure or buybacks, but I'm not going to sit here and give an outlook or guidance as it relates to buybacks for the year for all those reasons. Thanks, Bryan. Thank you, everyone."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead, sir.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter\u2019s third quarter 2020 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.Charter.com, under the Financial Information section.

On today\u2019s call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. Despite the significant challenges that COVID-19 has posed, we\u2019ve been able to operate our business throughout the pandemic. Early in the pandemic, we offered our customers a set of programs, including our Remote Education Offer, and Keep America Connected Pledge that supported customers\u2019 needs, resulting in a significantly higher number of customers enjoying our services. In addition, we opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use, opened up our Spectrum News websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information, rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to healthcare providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video subscribers. Our employees were given additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by a $1.50 an hour, and we remain on path to a $20 minimum wage by 2022. Our ability to operate for our customers and communities, despite the challenging environment is a testament to the quality of our in-sourced and onshore workforce, our safety precautions, and in many cases, our ability to operate remotely. Our ads -- our sales and care agents have continued to sell our products and to provide outstanding service to our customers. Most of our stores have been able to remain open throughout the pandemic, serving customers\u2019 need. Our field operations personnel have handled professional installations and repairs, have continued their work in the field, servicing customers in their homes and maintaining the quality of our physical plant. Our plant construction has continued and we\u2019ve actually seen plant miles and passings increase more this year than last. And our product development team has continued to develop and roll out various product improvements, including updates, enhancements to our video, internet and mobile products. Our ability to continue to operate well under the circumstances is also the result of investments we\u2019ve made in various parts of our business over the last several years, including our investments in systems integrations and automation, our self-installation program, which ran at over 80% of installations during the quarter, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, and our network including DOCSIS 3.1, which provides ample bandwidth to withstand surge in use with residential data usage for internet-only customers remaining at an elevated 600 gigabytes per month during the third quarter. Our operating and investment strategy has allowed us to sustain and accelerate our customer and financial growth. During the quarter, we added 537,000 residential and small business internet customers versus 380,000 in the prior year quarter. In the past 12 months, we\u2019ve added 2.3 million internet customers and 2 million overall customer relationships. We\u2019re growing well and gaining share against all our competitors in all of our markets, regardless of competitive infrastructure. In the third quarter, we grew our mobile lines by 363,000, 87,000 more than in the third quarter of last year and continued acceleration from last quarter. We recently purchased 210 CBRS priority access licenses in 106 counties across all our key DMAs for just over $460 million. Over a multi-year period, we\u2019ll execute on our inside-out strategy with small cells attached to our existing network, using unlicensed, and now our licensed spectrum, based on the disciplined return-on-investment approach, consistent with our goal of reducing mobile operating costs. Turning to the third quarter financials. We grew consolidated EBITDA by over 13%, and our third quarter free cash flow grew by nearly 40% year-over-year. Looking forward and subject to what happens with the virus, unemployment stimulus, we expect our broadband and mobile products to continue to drive demand and churn and growth to return to pre-pandemic levels. SMB has actually performed better than we expected. And our ability to grow will also be partly tied to the economy. In enterprise, retail sales activity is picking back up, despite limited onsite access, and those new sales getting installed in the coming -- as those new sales get installed in the coming months, we expect enterprise revenue growth to pick back up. Our advertising business is improving, and our core ad business excluding political is about 90% back to normal in part because of the amount of sporting events that are now airing. So, core ad sales are improving, and we still expect political advertising to be meaningfully contribute -- a meaningful contributor in the fourth quarter. To maintain that growth, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our networks, so that we can continue to offer new and better products than our competitors. In the coming years, we expect data usage per customer to continue to grow, and we\u2019re prepared to deliver more throughput across our network. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth of IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the number of growing IP devices connected to our network, which is nearing 400 million devices. And new and emerging products and services are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning or telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats for example. We\u2019re continuously increasing the capacity in our core and hubs, and augmenting the network to improve speeds and performance. In the near-term, however, we have a large opportunity to improve throughput and latency by continuing to use already deployed DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still has a long runway. And additional bandwidth tools available to us today include the conversion of the distribution network to DOCSIS 3.1 delivery for all products including video broadband and telephony. By allocating more plant spectrum to DOCSIS 3.1 IP services, we have the ability to offer symmetrical gigabit-plus speeds. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors in the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality. The DOCSIS 4.0 specification allows for multiple paths through each 10-gig and higher speeds, including Full Duplex DOCSIS Extended Spectrum DOCSIS, Both 3.1 and 4.0 DOCSIS can be deployed in an economically efficient way as the market dictates. Our network evolution strategy allows us to offer superior connectivity products to meet changing consumer demand and extend our growth strategy and drive free cash flow. Before turning the call over to Chris, I\u2019d once again like to thank Charter\u2019s employees for their hard work, dedication and diligence throughout the pandemic. They\u2019ve been asked to go above and beyond their regular duties, and they have delivered. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey : Thanks, Tom. Turning to customer results on slide five of our presentation. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by approximately 2 million over the last 12 months or by 6.8%, and by 457,000 in the third quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our internet customers by 537,000 in the quarter and by 2.3 million or 8.8% over the last 12 months. Video grew by 67,000 in the quarter, better than last year\u2019s third quarter decline of 75,000 video customers. The positive performance was driven by churn benefits, particularly when bundled with broadband. And similarly, wireline voice declines by only 25,000 compared to a loss of 190,000 in the prior year quarter. Mobile line net adds accelerated again to the 363,000 in the quarter. To put what is already a strong third quarter subscriber results into perspective, remember that our Q2 results of 755,000 customer relationship net adds and 850,000 internet net adds already included the benefit of our COVID programs. And our third quarter results reflect any churn out of those programs. Our year-to-date customer growth, shown on slide 6, remains the right metric for industry comparability, given different reporting. So, in the third quarter, we saw excellent retention rates for our Remote Education Offer. Churn has been similar to regular new customer acquisition churn. We re-launched the program very late in September with de minimis impact on our third quarter internet net adds. Going forward, we expect the acquisition volume of this offer to be significantly lower than the original program. And given the high retention rate of customers added during the first half of this year, we won\u2019t be breaking out this offer separately. Our Keep Americans Connected program completed in late June and we saw a good retention of those customers in the third quarter. In the second quarter, we put approximately 200,000 customers that were past normal disconnection back into current status through a write-off of their debt. And so far, the vast majority are paying with minimal difference to normal customers. So, the retention has been much better than our expectations. The development of customer\u2019s ability to pay generally through employment or subsidies remains the key driver for our short-term residential outlook. As I mentioned last quarter, our customer growth performance should be measured by our full-year performance, rather than a particular quarter. As the third quarter progressed, we could already see the market return into more normal turn activity and net add levels, and we expect that to be the case in Q4. Turning to the financials on slide 7. As we expected, there continued to be moving parts due to COVID, and I\u2019ll reference some of those items, which we\u2019ve again laid out on slide 9 of today\u2019s presentation with full year summary on slide 19. Residential revenue grew by 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth and similar PSU bundle and video mix trends we\u2019ve seen over several quarters. The 6.9% customer relationship growth in residential was partially offset by a $218 million one-time adjustment for estimated sports network rebates that we intend to credit to video customers. Due to accounting treatment, which I\u2019ll cover in a moment, not all of that rebate estimate was offset in the current period expense. SMB revenue grew by 1.5%. And while revenue growth was slow this quarter, due to the first half volume and SMB customers that remain on our seasonal plan, our customer growth has accelerated, despite a still tough economic climate for small and medium business. Spectrum enterprise revenue declined by 4.3% year-over-year, driven by the sale of Navisite in the prior year period and the continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. While the comparability issue for Navisite goes away after Q3, wholesale, in particular cell tower backhaul, has been challenged and probably continues that way until late next year, based on current activity. Retail enterprise, which is the vast majority of our enterprise revenue is growing around 6%, driven more by pre-COVID sales than the last six months\u2019 performance. As Tom mentioned, enterprise sales activity has now picked back up, despite limited onsite access. As those new sales get installed in the subsequent months, we expect enterprise revenue growth can recover and begin to accelerate next year. Spectrum Reach third quarter advertising revenue increased by 17%, primarily driven by political. Excluding political, core ad revenue was down by about 10%, which is reflected on slide 9\u2019s COVID impacts. So, our core, very much tied to the economy, is coming back and was significantly better than the second quarter with or without the recent heavy sports burn. Obviously, we expect the fourth quarter to benefit from political as well. Mobile revenue totaled $368 million, with $172 million of that being device revenue. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 5.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on slide 8. In the third quarter, total operating expense grew by $36 million or 0.5% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses, excluding mobile, declined by 1.2% year-over-year or 0.8%, excluding Navisite, with a number of COVID-related items outlined on slide 9. Programming decreased 2.3% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. And this quarter includes a $163 million benefit related to sports networks rebates. The difference between the $218 million estimated credit to video customers, which lowered revenue and the $163 million programming benefit, relates to an expected reduction in sports rights content cost, which is recognized in the produced content line over the remaining life to contract, similar to the delayed expense recognition in Q2, when games were canceled. From a cash perspective, however, we will provide our customers a bill credit for the rebates received from the sports program networks when those details are finalized. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, and were comprised of lower regulatory and franchise fees, offset by higher video CPE sold to customers and higher sports rights costs. Costs to service customers increased by 0.4% year-over-year with meaningful productivity improvement, lower bad debt, and higher wages and benefits as drivers. Bad debt expense was down year-over-year, given surprisingly, probably our best ever payment and collection trends. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers was up 7.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 6.8% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year, COVID flex time and the timing of medical benefits costs. On slide 9 of today\u2019s presentation we\u2019ve isolated the temporary bad debt benefit as customers paid better than usual and the labor costs increase from an acceleration in frontline wage increases and benefits timing. I expect continued non-recurring puts and takes on this line item for a few more quarters. Over time costs to service customers should have gain to grow at a slower rate than customer relationship growth due to lower transaction volume and higher self-service trends, despite the step up in minimum wages. General marketing and sales expenses declined by 0.7% year-over-year as our unit growth did benefit significantly from lower churn. Other expense declined by 2.5% year-over-year, primarily due to Navisite cost in the prior year period. And mobile expenses totaled $456 million, and they were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage costs, and operating expense. Mobile EBITDA is still negative because of customer growth cost, but by much less, despite the higher growth. Another way of describing that trend is that we have now crossed 2 million lines and our mobile service revenue now exceeds all regular operating costs, excluding acquisition and growth-related mobile costs. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 13.6% in the quarter when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $88 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.7%. We generated $814 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter and capital expenditures totaled $2 billion in the third quarter. Our third quarter capital expenditure shows we\u2019ve continued to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in continued capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage. We have not slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas. We continue to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and swaps, as well as the high attach rate for advanced in-home WiFi service. We also continue to invest in facility improvements, back office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2020, we still expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year, but maybe only slightly due to the significant customer growth and related CPE and capacity investment. We generated $1.8 billion of consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter and excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $2 billion of cable free cash flow, up about $500 million versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Currently, we don\u2019t expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022. We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times or 4.2 times, if you look at cable only. Earlier this month, we issued $1.5 billion of 12-year high-yield notes at a yield of roughly 4%. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our current run rate annualized cash interest is $3.8 billion, and we remain comfortable in the middle to high end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $3.6 billion at an average price of $592 per share. We will always evaluate the best use of our capital to generate long-term returns for shareholders, be it organic investments, such as our launch of mobile or network edge-outs, accretive M&A, or purchasing of our own shares and probably in that order. The prioritization of organic investments is because there is high demand for our products across every part of our footprint, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network is well-invested, ready and working for future opportunities. As the environment continues to evolve, our goal is to stay focused on what we do well and to execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees to create shareholder value. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, guys. A couple of questions about broadband. I can\u2019t help but notice that you guys talked about the fact that you\u2019re competing well, really regardless of the infrastructure that you\u2019re going against. Obviously, strong numbers across the board for the industry in terms of broadband net adds. Can you talk about how you\u2019re competing against fiber competitors and sort of market flow share, if you could cite some numbers there? And then, the other number that stuck out to me was the 600 gigabytes of usage and the continued growth there. It looks like maybe we\u2019re a couple of years away from a terabyte on average for broadband-only customers. Tom, how does that affect competition, as you look out over the next few years, I think, specifically against fixed wireless access? Does it make it more difficult for fixed wireless to be a true competitor to sort of wire and cable service? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well, John, how do we compete with -- we have -- it\u2019s not just the products, but the products do matter, and it\u2019s obviously what you\u2019re selling as a product, how much capacity, how much speed, how much throughput, what the reliability is, but also how well you service it and how efficient you are at delivering the product. And so, we\u2019re competitive with the infrastructure that we have against all of the various competitive infrastructures we go against, fiber, fixed wireless, satellite and copper-based high-capacity networks. And so, our network is highly capable. It\u2019s easy to augment from a capital investment point of view. It\u2019s very efficient to augment. And we keep our product sets and our service sets better than our competitors, and we prevail in most -- almost everywhere we operate. How do I think about that going forward with fixed wireless? I think that all of the various opportunities for competition require significant capital investment by our competitors. And I think, our network sets up better from a capital investment perspective, going forward, so that we can provide more capacity and more capability at lower costs than our competitors. So, it\u2019s a very competitive environment. There\u2019s a lot of different ways of making the competition work. But, I think, our network has superior capabilities to properly manage.\nChris Winfrey: John, I\u2019d just add. I kind of went out of my way in my prepared remarks to say if you want to compare against some of that competition, you really need to take a look because of the moving parts throughout the different quarters. You need to look at the year-to-date results and compare that in terms of what\u2019s Charter doing in front of competition. Tom mentioned, we have competition essentially everywhere we operate we\u2019ve had that. It\u2019s not new. But, we\u2019re performing very well. And if you take a look at our Q3 year-to-date results, I think, that\u2019s probably the most indicative way to really look at it and think about the performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Picking up a little bit on the same themes that John asked about, I wanted to ask, Tom, about the network evolution you discussed going to IP video. Just so I understand, are you taking down MPEG across the system? And is that something that requires a swapping out of boxes? Just what are the capital business implications of moving video over to IP on 3.1? Obviously, that seems like a big transition from historical approach. And then, again, just going back to the broadband results this year across the industry, it seems like we\u2019ve pulled forward penetration in broadband in the United States. If we just look at the year-to-date growth, it\u2019s an unbelievably strong year across the industry. So, I\u2019m just wondering, I don\u2019t know, Chris, if you want to take this one, but just thinking about lapping this year, next year and thinking about the quality of the customers you brought on. I know you\u2019ve seen good churn stats so far. But, should we be thinking about this pull forward having maybe lapping this next year and next year is going to be a below average year? I don\u2019t know if you have any thoughts on sort of where we go from here as we come out of COVID, which is obviously just pulled all this growth into 2020. Thank you, both.\nTom Rutledge: Okay, Ben. So, how does the network work? Right now, we actually run three -- actually more than three, but three major networks inside of one physical infrastructure. So, we have DOCSIS 3.1, which is a -- which we use capacity to deliver IP-based services to specific modems households and customers. We also have a DOCSIS 3.0 infrastructure inside of our network, and we have a QAM-based video infrastructure. Most of the network is still dedicated by QAM-based video, the traditional cable TV service, and delivered to consumers that way. So, you can actually -- and today, we have multiple ways of delivering video to our customers and other services. And we have 10 million app-based streaming products -- devices connected to our network where the customer has downloaded an app, and we\u2019re feeding that approximately -- our app, with a full bundle of video packages, and the consumer brings their own device. We also have a significant distribution of QAM-based traditional cable TV services. And we are planning on mixing the two together in the same device. And we do -- for instance, we have Netflix on our set-top boxes in a device we provide, but it\u2019s actually being delivered through a different path to the box. So, the box will look at video from the traditional cable TV path, and we\u2019ll also look at the new IP paths and combine them together in a seamless experience for the customer. So, we have the ability to manage CPE and customers through time and manage the way we use our network in an efficient way to provide a full range of services. And with regard to MPEG, even if we deliver IP video, we\u2019ll -- as we do, we still use MPEG to do it. That\u2019s the digital format of videos in. And there is an opportunity through compression going from MPEG-2, which is still widely distributed by us to MPEG-4. And there\u2019s opportunity through the addition of products to what we call switch to video, which can be either IP or MPEG, traditional QAM-based MPEG. And we can manage how much is switched, how much is an MPEG 2, how much is in QAM, how much is in DOCSIS 3.0 and how much is in DOCSIS 3.1 and actually run all of that at the same time. So, we have a lot of room. And, I think the key takeaway is that traditional video is still the largest single -- it\u2019s more than half the capacity of the infrastructure.\nBen Swinburne: Yes. But, you don\u2019t need to replace boxes in order to move that network?\nChris Winfrey: No, no.\nTom Rutledge: Okay. That\u2019s the key point. Yes, got it.\nChris Winfrey: And on your broadband question, I\u2019ll take a crack at it, and Tom may want to add more to it. The industry has grown at a faster pace. And we\u2019ve taken a higher amount of share across all areas of our footprint and infrastructures, as Tom mentioned. Where you\u2019re seeing that come from is broadband nevers and also the acceleration of mobile-only in addition to the significant share shift that we\u2019re seeing is cable generally. I don\u2019t think, whether that was a pull forward or not, I don\u2019t know. But, it doesn\u2019t go backwards. I think, the demonstration -- the need for the product is there. I don\u2019t think it goes away. I think, it\u2019s a permanent, either shift or trend of reducing the mobile-only and requiring more broadband in the household. What I think we are seeing already, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks is late in Q3, you could already start to see the market move to more normal transaction activity. And that includes both, churn and sales. We think that\u2019s indicative where Q4 is probably heading. And I think, probably for next year as well, you\u2019ll have higher levels of mover churn and market churn. And as a result, you have higher sales, as that moves through. And I think, next year right now, probably looks more like a normal year as opposed to 2020.\nTom Rutledge: The other thing I would add just in terms of longer run trends, yes, COVID had some impact on broadband adoption, but so does the change in the video business that\u2019s going on rapidly. And as more and more people are using IP-connected devices to bring video services that traditionally would have been delivered either over the air or by cable. That increases overall demand for broadband in the home. And I think, that also is simultaneously going on. So, you have a sort of overall demand change as a result of what\u2019s really going on in video. And so, I don\u2019t know that it changes adoption rates so much going forward. But, as it just shifted the entire amount of people that would be interested in having in-home broadband service, which kind of ties into John\u2019s question about the suitability of wireless access over time, when you have that kind of throughput going through. I agree.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. So, even with the increase in broadband demand, which is quite evident, you posted video net adds for the second quarter in a row, significantly bucking industry trends. So, first, have trends in fourth quarter indicated that you can continue those trends, or was it COVID-related, the pulse rate that you were talking about? And second, what specifically about your offering do you believe consumers are responding to? And then, just as a second topic. Tom, just to follow-up on your advertising comments. You said that the core underlying advertising is 90% back to normal. What do you think the drivers there? Because it still seems that local businesses are struggling. So, what are you doing differently, or what metrics you do -- what data are you using that\u2019s different?\nTom Rutledge: Well, if you look at our overall connectivity growth as Charter versus the industry, we have higher and faster connectivity growth, generally speaking, to the industry. And as a result of that, we\u2019re pulling through video with that growth. If you just think about overall video penetration, as a percentage of households and you think about changing households over to your network, you\u2019re going to pull through a certain percentage of video. And if you grow fast enough, you\u2019ll grow video, as a result of that. And we said that in the last call in terms of why we think our video growth is positive. We don\u2019t think that the overall video marketplace has changed, meaning we still think fat bundles is a very expensive video or under pressure and will continue to be. And so, you\u2019re going to have continued erosion of that bundle we think through time. But,, we\u2019re just growing faster than that erosion. With regard to ad sales, I\u2019ll let Chris answer that. But, I want to say one thing about local businesses. They are under duress. But, our SMB growth rate is higher this year than it was last year in the third quarter. And so, we\u2019re actually seeing a lot of -- yes, there\u2019s a lot of damage out there, but there\u2019s also a lot of reinvention and a lot of new business formation at the very small business level, and we\u2019re taking advantage of that.\nChris Winfrey: Jessica, the Spectrum Reach, which is our advertising group, as you mentioned, is back to 90% of prior year on the non-political, except the local advertising. From what I\u2019ve seen so far, most of our peers are reporting kind of a similar range of their core advertising being back. And so, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that unique. I think, for the industry, some of that benefit was the lack of advertising in Q2 and people wanted to get back into the market. Some of that was tied to -- a lot of that was tied to what Tom said is the SMB space is behaving well for us on the business side. But also the sports timing in the third quarter, you had a doubling or in some cases tripling of sports activity inside of the third quarter related to a lot of the delayed seasons for the different sports. And that was encapsulated inside of Q3. So, that admittedly helped. From a Charter-specific perspective, we have New York City and L.A., and they\u2019ve been more locked down than other markets. So, from an economic perspective, we have a slight drag or delay in that returning relative to others. But, if you really step back, despite the overall market having negative video trends and everything that\u2019s said about the traditional advertising space, we have a good runway for growth in front of us because of our ability to monetize the long tail of the inventory by tools that we\u2019ve developed to really drive impression-based viewing measurement and to be able to sell our product, our advertising product on that basis. So, traditional channels that weren\u2019t able to be monetized are now able to be monetized and packaged in a really different way and sold it at a different price, together with addressability and a lot of the additional interactive advertising features that you\u2019re well aware of that we\u2019ve been adding to the portfolio. So, even in an environment where video is slightly declining, I think, absent a pandemic, we have the ability to grow our core advertising in political and non-political years alike. And so, that business is -- outside of the pandemic, that business is actually in very good shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Two quick ones. So, Chris, you mentioned that next year would be a more normal broadband year. But, you\u2019ve been accelerating broadband subs ever since the Time Warner Cable acquisition. What do you think of as a normal broadband subscriber growth here? Is that sort of 6% year-over-year growth? And then on\u2026\nChris Winfrey: We love you, Jonathan. Next question?\nJonathan Chaplin: I still expect an answer to the question though, Chris. And then, on EBITDA growth, the contribution from wireless this quarter was awesome. And I assume that just continues -- the losses continue to recede and that will be a propellant for EBITDA next year as well. Do you have a sense of what that could contribute to year-over-year growth for EBITDA next year?\nChris Winfrey: So, on both of those, kind of bit of guidance questions, which isn\u2019t what we do. The honest answer to your first question is we don\u2019t know. And we see trends reverting back to normal, which would mean more normalized growth. Does that mean more like 2019? Does that mean continued acceleration somewhere? Yes, I guess, is the answer to both of those questions, I don\u2019t know. But, I think, it\u2019s going to be good, either way. And so, we\u2019re really positive on the outlook for broadband. Obviously, as we look further out to the extent that we\u2019re doing rural build and expanding our footprint to the extent that mobile really has a significant impact both at acquisition as well as churn, to the extent that there\u2019s additional mobile substitution that declines for all the reasons that we talked about before, all of those things would be positive relative to our normal growth rate. And so, we need to see how all that develops. On the wireless side, to your point, you can look at it a few different ways. You can take a look at our losses per mobile line, which is doing very well. You can think about it in terms of what I said before is that once we got to 2 million lines, which we crossed over inside this quarter, that it\u2019s now an incrementally positive business, but for the subscriber acquisition cost. So, it\u2019s already EBITDA positive if we decided to stop growing, which of course, we won\u2019t do. So, the answer to your question is, yes, it\u2019s going to continue to get better. But, the amount that it continues to get better in terms of its contribution to Our EBITDA performance really depends on the growth rate of wireless and that subscriber acquisition cost. The faster you grow, the more you\u2019re going to spend. And we\u2019re going to try to grow as fast as we can. So, it depends on growth.\nTom Rutledge: The other quick way to think about mobile is, yes, it\u2019s EBITDA positive going forward, and it\u2019s -- and as it\u2019s currently priced. But, if you grow mobile rapidly as we are, you\u2019ll grow your broadband rapidly too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar from Barclays.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Chris, I guess, a couple for you. The first is on the gross addition front, I mean, obviously, the gross adds have been really strong this year, and many of them have come in at a lower price. And in general, gross additions come in at a lower price. So, when you look at ARPU next year, it should be stronger than normal because of the cohort shift this year and the bigger volume of growth additions. So, I just wanted to understand if that\u2019s the right way to think about it, or if there are other things that offset that benefit? And then, secondly, in terms of home passing, you guys have been I think growing at more than 2% this year, which is higher than household formation and higher than most others in the industry. If you could give us some sense of the attach rates for these newer homes passed versus your existing base to give us a sense of what the mix of these newer homes looks like, that would be useful. Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So, I think the answer to your first question on gross additions is it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a mixed bag. Q2 of this year definitely had higher gross additions for all the reasons that we talked about inside of Q2. Q3 did not. As I mentioned, the activity levels dropped significantly, both on -- particularly related to churn, which also has the impact of reducing sales across the entire market because you have less flow. And so, inside the third quarter, one of the reasons our marketing and sales cost was so low, despite the significant growth that we had, was tied to that very fact. So, I think you\u2019re going to see a mixed bag inside of next year as it relates to ARPU impacts from promotional pricing roll off. On top of that, I would argue that the biggest driver of our ARPU development really is less about the individual PSU pricing at roll off and it ties much more to the amount of single play sell-in. And so, that\u2019s the biggest driver that\u2019s going on together with the video to tier mix. So, when you think about our success in selling spectrum stream and choice and essentials products, has a bigger impact than the mix that you were referring to. On the homes passed, when we do new construction to patents is what we call brownfield or greenfield, but we have pretty steady penetration curves over each vintage, if you want to call it that, of what we\u2019re building. And that\u2019s what gives us a lot of confidence to go do more of it because we can see at a high level of consistency in terms of our ability to get to very-high terminal penetrations when we build into markets. And so, that\u2019s what gives us confidence in our ability to go extend that investment concept. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s helpful in answering the question, but we like the penetration, the speed and the curve of the penetration that we\u2019re getting in these new passings.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you. Two questions, if I could. First, if I could just stay with what you were just talking about, with the adoption curves in new markets. Can you share with us how much of this quarter\u2019s growth came from newly passed homes or is it homes passed within last 24 months or so, just to get a sense of where we\u2019re seeing penetration of newly opened markets versus where we\u2019re seeing increases in penetration of mature markets? And then, separately, just given how promotional the wireless market has become in the last few months -- or the last month or so in the wake of the iPhone launch, how does that affect your thinking about your own promotional stance in customer acquisition for wireless? And, how should we think about what cost that might fare for the fourth quarter?\nChris Winfrey: So, Craig, why don\u2019t I take the first one and Tom could grab the second. I don\u2019t have the number in front of me, but it\u2019s not the material driver for our net additions, the new passings construction. It\u2019s been relatively small when you consider that compared to our 52 million passings overall. It\u2019s helpful, but it\u2019s not the material driver of our growth. A simple way to think about it is, if you think about greenfield new construction anywhere historically, past couple of years, has been 500,000 to 600,000 homes. And so, that gives you what you would need to go model and say apply an adoption curve to that number of passings and you can get to a number. And what you\u2019d see is it\u2019s meaningful but it\u2019s not material to our overall internet net additions growth rate.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. I\u2019d say, it\u2019s meaningful, but not material. Yes. I agree with that. Promotional, our basic proposition when you think about wireless is that we can save consumers a lot of money. And if you look at the average wireless bill most households are paying, they can connect to us and buy the right package from us and save a significant amount of household spend, telecom spend, and reallocate that to us. That\u2019s our primary objective. And we don\u2019t -- we have the ability to switch customers over who already have a wireless account to our product. And, we\u2019re not driven by new hardware for the consumer to drive our business. The consumer can bring their hardware with them and connect to us and save money. And so, yes, we\u2019re oriented toward making our price successful in the marketplace and we\u2019ll have to compete with that price. But, we already have a significant price discount to what most people are paying for their wireless service. And as a result of that, we\u2019ve had accelerating growth in wireless connections. And so, we\u2019re offering real value to consumers and real overall savings by having them connect to us, both for their broadband and their wireless products.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks. And Tom, I just want to say you guys, I was delighted to see the extension of your contract this morning. So, are we to understand that as you are now under contract until the end of 2024?\nTom Rutledge: Yes, more time in the salt mine.\nCraig Moffett: Then, I think I can speak for a lot of Charter shareholders in saying that I think there are going to be a lot of people that are delighted to have you stay.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you very much. It\u2019s very kind of you to say.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JP Morgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hey guys. Two, if I can. First, a follow-up on Jessica\u2019s question. What is the video attach rate to broadband sales these days? And how has that changed in the last few years? And second, a little more on wireless. You talked about a network build over time with the inside-out strategy. How does that take advantage of spectrum? And does cellular get integrated into your home routers over time, do you build that in dense outdoor markets like Comcast talked about yesterday? What\u2019s the sort of the plan over time?\nTom Rutledge: Yes. So, I mean, the attach rate of video to broadband has been declining steadily. And that\u2019s because the overall penetration of video -- traditional video is declining steadily. And so, the reason we are growing video isn\u2019t because that ratio has changed. It\u2019s because we\u2019re growing broadband faster and therefore pulling some video through with it.\nChris Winfrey: There is an interesting stat attached to that is related is we really don\u2019t sell video. We sell a package of connectivity service. If you asked how many video single play do you sell? It\u2019s about 5% of our video sales are coming through in single play. So, we really don\u2019t sell video. We sell that as an application or a service attached to the connectivity service.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. And with regard to your second question, maybe I wasn\u2019t clear -- go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: I was just going to say what -- so what is -- if 95% of your sales are attached to broadband and not -- yes, and so what is video as a percentage of this.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. We\u2019re not providing that I think for competitive purposes, but we\u2019re saying it\u2019s been declining, and that hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019ve just sold more broadband, which is why we have more video.\nTom Rutledge: And so, this inside out strategy and how do we use spectrum? And, can you put it in the house? Interestingly, our WiFi capabilities and available spectrum for WiFi has continued to improve. The FCC has just granted significant amounts of WiFi spectrum to the public for use. And we plan to use that spectrum inside dwellings. And so, when we think about spectrum and the spectrum we recently got with CBRS, it\u2019s can you augment your WiFi spectrum with the CBRS spectrum to move traffic onto your own network that you might be paying someone else to carry. And the answer is yes. And you can do that in an efficient way, depending on the location and where you put the radio in such a way that you can actually reduce your overall cost. And as a result of that cost reduction, you get a return on investment on the capital you spend on both the spectrum and the radios that you\u2019ve deployed. There are applications where CBRS spectrum or WiFi spectrum used differently than it has in the past can be used in enterprise connectivity using a 5G factory kind of notions where you would control the inside of a building using spectrum. So, there are individual products where you would want to have multiple radios, potentially, in the same environment. Whether you need to do that in a household in the short run or not is not that clear because there\u2019s so much WiFi spectrum available. But there are applications I can think of like farms and other places like that where CBRS could cover the whole property, 100 acres or 500 acres of property or even more for connectivity services. So, it\u2019s a tool. We look at spectrum as a tool to extend the connectivity, and we plan to use it in ways where it takes our cost structure down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Hi. Good morning. I wanted to follow up, I guess, on a couple of topics. So, one for Tom and then one for Chris. Tom, I wanted to follow up on your earlier comments on the HFC network. I think, there\u2019s been more talk recently in the industry about operators over building with fiber-to-the-home. The advantage is obviously being upstream and latency. How are you thinking about the trade-offs now between deploying more fiber-to-the-home versus continuing with HFC, particularly given some of the changes in upstream traffic patterns during COVID? And, can you just help us to understand how that upstream bandwidth and latency improve as the DOCSIS infrastructure evolves? And then, Chris, I wanted to follow up on the build-out or the inside-out strategy that Tom mentioned in his prepared remarks. Can you give us any color on the magnitude or the significance of the capital investment that we could expect there? And maybe just some timing comments broadly speaking. And is that a long time to reach positive ROI, or is it a fairly short duration?\nTom Rutledge: So, Bryan, on the HFC plant, we think that there\u2019s a lot of capacity in the HFC plant, both downstream and upstream. And we think that given the current marketplace and utilization behaviors of consumers that we have plenty of upstream capacity. And we have a pathway using DOCSIS 3.1 technology and later, 4.1 technology to continue to increase that. And we have a vision that in the event that there is a transformative product set that needs upstream that would create value for consumers and then for us that we could fairly rapidly upgrade our plant to get a massive change in upstream capability. So, we build with fiber on the increment because it\u2019s cheaper. But, we think that the HFC plant can be equal to fiber from a capability, latency, capacity perspective, for years to come. And we think that with relatively small capital investments compared to replacement cost new, which is what fiber is, that we can upgrade the network and be competitive for a very-long period of time.\nChris Winfrey: And as it relates to the CBRS build-out, it\u2019s really a function of a few variables. One is the number of subscribers that you have. The more you have, the more economical build would be the usage of those subscribers, the amount of WiFi offload that you can get already, what is your rate on MVNO, and what\u2019s your density in the build cost. And as Tom mentioned, we wouldn\u2019t be building just to build a network. We\u2019d be building tied to a guaranteed effectively cost reduction. And so, the ROI is not only relatively quick, but it\u2019s very clear, and there\u2019s very low risk. And so, we\u2019re not building any inside-out strategy just to have a network or for other network type build reasons, other than cost reduction. And, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be material in the short term. I think, it will occur for a many multiyear period. And you could argue that as the mobile retail store build-out declines for mobile that could be substituted over time with some additional build-out, which has a direct correlation to cost reduction. And as we start to do that, we\u2019re not doing that yet. We\u2019ll probably provide a little more color on what we think the effective payback of that is. But, I think the thing you should take comfort is that we\u2019re not building just to build, and it\u2019s going to be tied to a clear cost reduction in ROI.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. The thing I would add to it is, yes, we have the $460 million of cost for CBRS spectrum. But the incremental capital is very specific to the location and the amount of traffic that we would save in essentially radio by radio kind of investment. It doesn\u2019t require building out a complete footprint. It\u2019s actually opportunistic by location.\nOperator: And our final question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good morning. So, over time, you\u2019ve given us a lot of insight into broadband consumption trends. I was curious if you can give us an update of how your video customers are now engaging with your platform, especially as you grow in subs year-to-date, with respect to maybe what percent of your customers engage with your VOD platform or the digital applications that you offer for the cable networks offer and need to be authenticated through Charter? And then, if you take all of that in aggregate, how much time they\u2019re spending with you guys? And then, as you roll that up then, how does that instruct your video strategy going forward in terms of the way you want to aggregate and distribute content? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: I don\u2019t know that I can answer that directly, except to say this. We track what our customers do with their video products. And we also track how they rate our applications and what their customer experience is and what our availability of content is to sell to the consumer. And we try to mix and match that in a way that we create the overall value and the relationship we have with the customer, but also create a product that makes money. And we\u2019ve had some success in managing new ways of delivering video. As I said, we have over 10 million users who are getting their service through applications as opposed through traditional hardware. And so, we look at the business is evolving. We think that people will continue to buy rich packages for years to come, but we also think there are other opportunities to sell a variety of video services to consumers in different formats and that we can improve the customer experience by being a good place for consumers to interact with us to get those video services. And so, we\u2019re working toward that, and we\u2019re making some success. And we\u2019re actually optimistic in the very long term about our video business.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Mike. That concludes the call.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you, everyone.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, all.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: With that, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s Charter\u2019s third quarter 2020 investor call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Turning to customer results on slide five of our presentation. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by approximately 2 million over the last 12 months or by 6.8%, and by 457,000 in the third quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our internet customers by 537,000 in the quarter and by 2.3 million or 8.8% over the last 12 months. Video grew by 67,000 in the quarter, better than last year's third quarter decline of 75,000 video customers. The positive performance was driven by churn benefits, particularly when bundled with broadband. And similarly, wireline voice declines by only 25,000 compared to a loss of 190,000 in the prior year quarter. Mobile line net adds accelerated again to the 363,000 in the quarter. To put what is already a strong third quarter subscriber results into perspective, remember that our Q2 results of 755,000 customer relationship net adds and 850,000 internet net adds already included the benefit of our COVID programs. And our third quarter results reflect any churn out of those programs. Our year-to-date customer growth, shown on slide 6, remains the right metric for industry comparability, given different reporting. So, in the third quarter, we saw excellent retention rates for our Remote Education Offer. Churn has been similar to regular new customer acquisition churn. We re-launched the program very late in September with de minimis impact on our third quarter internet net adds. Going forward, we expect the acquisition volume of this offer to be significantly lower than the original program. And given the high retention rate of customers added during the first half of this year, we won't be breaking out this offer separately. Our Keep Americans Connected program completed in late June and we saw a good retention of those customers in the third quarter. In the second quarter, we put approximately 200,000 customers that were past normal disconnection back into current status through a write-off of their debt. And so far, the vast majority are paying with minimal difference to normal customers. So, the retention has been much better than our expectations. The development of customer's ability to pay generally through employment or subsidies remains the key driver for our short-term residential outlook. As I mentioned last quarter, our customer growth performance should be measured by our full-year performance, rather than a particular quarter. As the third quarter progressed, we could already see the market return into more normal turn activity and net add levels, and we expect that to be the case in Q4. Turning to the financials on slide 7. As we expected, there continued to be moving parts due to COVID, and I'll reference some of those items, which we've again laid out on slide 9 of today's presentation with full year summary on slide 19. Residential revenue grew by 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth and similar PSU bundle and video mix trends we've seen over several quarters. The 6.9% customer relationship growth in residential was partially offset by a $218 million one-time adjustment for estimated sports network rebates that we intend to credit to video customers. Due to accounting treatment, which I'll cover in a moment, not all of that rebate estimate was offset in the current period expense. SMB revenue grew by 1.5%. And while revenue growth was slow this quarter, due to the first half volume and SMB customers that remain on our seasonal plan, our customer growth has accelerated, despite a still tough economic climate for small and medium business. Spectrum enterprise revenue declined by 4.3% year-over-year, driven by the sale of Navisite in the prior year period and the continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. While the comparability issue for Navisite goes away after Q3, wholesale, in particular cell tower backhaul, has been challenged and probably continues that way until late next year, based on current activity. Retail enterprise, which is the vast majority of our enterprise revenue is growing around 6%, driven more by pre-COVID sales than the last six months' performance. As Tom mentioned, enterprise sales activity has now picked back up, despite limited onsite access. As those new sales get installed in the subsequent months, we expect enterprise revenue growth can recover and begin to accelerate next year. Spectrum Reach third quarter advertising revenue increased by 17%, primarily driven by political. Excluding political, core ad revenue was down by about 10%, which is reflected on slide 9's COVID impacts. So, our core, very much tied to the economy, is coming back and was significantly better than the second quarter with or without the recent heavy sports burn. Obviously, we expect the fourth quarter to benefit from political as well. Mobile revenue totaled $368 million, with $172 million of that being device revenue. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 5.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on slide 8. In the third quarter, total operating expense grew by $36 million or 0.5% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses, excluding mobile, declined by 1.2% year-over-year or 0.8%, excluding Navisite, with a number of COVID-related items outlined on slide 9. Programming decreased 2.3% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we've seen in prior quarters. And this quarter includes a $163 million benefit related to sports networks rebates. The difference between the $218 million estimated credit to video customers, which lowered revenue and the $163 million programming benefit, relates to an expected reduction in sports rights content cost, which is recognized in the produced content line over the remaining life to contract, similar to the delayed expense recognition in Q2, when games were canceled. From a cash perspective, however, we will provide our customers a bill credit for the rebates received from the sports program networks when those details are finalized. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses were essentially flat year-over-year, and were comprised of lower regulatory and franchise fees, offset by higher video CPE sold to customers and higher sports rights costs. Costs to service customers increased by 0.4% year-over-year with meaningful productivity improvement, lower bad debt, and higher wages and benefits as drivers. Bad debt expense was down year-over-year, given surprisingly, probably our best ever payment and collection trends. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers was up 7.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, primarily driven by 6.8% customer relationship growth, the hourly wage increase we instituted earlier in the year, COVID flex time and the timing of medical benefits costs. On slide 9 of today's presentation we've isolated the temporary bad debt benefit as customers paid better than usual and the labor costs increase from an acceleration in frontline wage increases and benefits timing. I expect continued non-recurring puts and takes on this line item for a few more quarters. Over time costs to service customers should have gain to grow at a slower rate than customer relationship growth due to lower transaction volume and higher self-service trends, despite the step up in minimum wages. General marketing and sales expenses declined by 0.7% year-over-year as our unit growth did benefit significantly from lower churn. Other expense declined by 2.5% year-over-year, primarily due to Navisite cost in the prior year period. And mobile expenses totaled $456 million, and they were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage costs, and operating expense. Mobile EBITDA is still negative because of customer growth cost, but by much less, despite the higher growth. Another way of describing that trend is that we have now crossed 2 million lines and our mobile service revenue now exceeds all regular operating costs, excluding acquisition and growth-related mobile costs. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 13.6% in the quarter when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $88 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.7%. We generated $814 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter and capital expenditures totaled $2 billion in the third quarter. Our third quarter capital expenditure shows we've continued to invest to support current and future growth. We invested significantly in continued capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of higher data usage. We have not slowed down on new build, including construction in rural areas. We continue to purchase significant DOCSIS 3.1 modems for new connects and swaps, as well as the high attach rate for advanced in-home WiFi service. We also continue to invest in facility improvements, back office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2020, we still expect cable capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year, but maybe only slightly due to the significant customer growth and related CPE and capacity investment. We generated $1.8 billion of consolidated free cash flow in the third quarter and excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $2 billion of cable free cash flow, up about $500 million versus last year's third quarter. Currently, we don't expect to be a meaningful federal taxpayer until 2022. We finished the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3 times or 4.2 times, if you look at cable only. Earlier this month, we issued $1.5 billion of 12-year high-yield notes at a yield of roughly 4%. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our current run rate annualized cash interest is $3.8 billion, and we remain comfortable in the middle to high end of our target leverage range of 4 to 4.5 times. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $3.6 billion at an average price of $592 per share. We will always evaluate the best use of our capital to generate long-term returns for shareholders, be it organic investments, such as our launch of mobile or network edge-outs, accretive M&A, or purchasing of our own shares and probably in that order. The prioritization of organic investments is because there is high demand for our products across every part of our footprint, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network is well-invested, ready and working for future opportunities. As the environment continues to evolve, our goal is to stay focused on what we do well and to execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees to create shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for questions. John, I'd just add. I kind of went out of my way in my prepared remarks to say if you want to compare against some of that competition, you really need to take a look because of the moving parts throughout the different quarters. You need to look at the year-to-date results and compare that in terms of what's Charter doing in front of competition. Tom mentioned, we have competition essentially everywhere we operate we've had that. It's not new. But, we're performing very well. And if you take a look at our Q3 year-to-date results, I think, that's probably the most indicative way to really look at it and think about the performance. No, no. And on your broadband question, I'll take a crack at it, and Tom may want to add more to it. The industry has grown at a faster pace. And we've taken a higher amount of share across all areas of our footprint and infrastructures, as Tom mentioned. Where you're seeing that come from is broadband nevers and also the acceleration of mobile-only in addition to the significant share shift that we're seeing is cable generally. I don't think, whether that was a pull forward or not, I don't know. But, it doesn't go backwards. I think, the demonstration -- the need for the product is there. I don't think it goes away. I think, it's a permanent, either shift or trend of reducing the mobile-only and requiring more broadband in the household. What I think we are seeing already, and I mentioned in the prepared remarks is late in Q3, you could already start to see the market move to more normal transaction activity. And that includes both, churn and sales. We think that's indicative where Q4 is probably heading. And I think, probably for next year as well, you'll have higher levels of mover churn and market churn. And as a result, you have higher sales, as that moves through. And I think, next year right now, probably looks more like a normal year as opposed to 2020. Jessica, the Spectrum Reach, which is our advertising group, as you mentioned, is back to 90% of prior year on the non-political, except the local advertising. From what I've seen so far, most of our peers are reporting kind of a similar range of their core advertising being back. And so, I don't think we're that unique. I think, for the industry, some of that benefit was the lack of advertising in Q2 and people wanted to get back into the market. Some of that was tied to -- a lot of that was tied to what Tom said is the SMB space is behaving well for us on the business side. But also the sports timing in the third quarter, you had a doubling or in some cases tripling of sports activity inside of the third quarter related to a lot of the delayed seasons for the different sports. And that was encapsulated inside of Q3. So, that admittedly helped. From a Charter-specific perspective, we have New York City and L.A., and they've been more locked down than other markets. So, from an economic perspective, we have a slight drag or delay in that returning relative to others. But, if you really step back, despite the overall market having negative video trends and everything that's said about the traditional advertising space, we have a good runway for growth in front of us because of our ability to monetize the long tail of the inventory by tools that we've developed to really drive impression-based viewing measurement and to be able to sell our product, our advertising product on that basis. So, traditional channels that weren't able to be monetized are now able to be monetized and packaged in a really different way and sold it at a different price, together with addressability and a lot of the additional interactive advertising features that you're well aware of that we've been adding to the portfolio. So, even in an environment where video is slightly declining, I think, absent a pandemic, we have the ability to grow our core advertising in political and non-political years alike. And so, that business is -- outside of the pandemic, that business is actually in very good shape. We love you, Jonathan. Next question? So, on both of those, kind of bit of guidance questions, which isn't what we do. The honest answer to your first question is we don't know. And we see trends reverting back to normal, which would mean more normalized growth. Does that mean more like 2019? Does that mean continued acceleration somewhere? Yes, I guess, is the answer to both of those questions, I don't know. But, I think, it's going to be good, either way. And so, we're really positive on the outlook for broadband. Obviously, as we look further out to the extent that we're doing rural build and expanding our footprint to the extent that mobile really has a significant impact both at acquisition as well as churn, to the extent that there's additional mobile substitution that declines for all the reasons that we talked about before, all of those things would be positive relative to our normal growth rate. And so, we need to see how all that develops. On the wireless side, to your point, you can look at it a few different ways. You can take a look at our losses per mobile line, which is doing very well. You can think about it in terms of what I said before is that once we got to 2 million lines, which we crossed over inside this quarter, that it's now an incrementally positive business, but for the subscriber acquisition cost. So, it's already EBITDA positive if we decided to stop growing, which of course, we won't do. So, the answer to your question is, yes, it's going to continue to get better. But, the amount that it continues to get better in terms of its contribution to Our EBITDA performance really depends on the growth rate of wireless and that subscriber acquisition cost. The faster you grow, the more you're going to spend. And we're going to try to grow as fast as we can. So, it depends on growth. So, I think the answer to your first question on gross additions is it's going to be a little bit of a mixed bag. Q2 of this year definitely had higher gross additions for all the reasons that we talked about inside of Q2. Q3 did not. As I mentioned, the activity levels dropped significantly, both on -- particularly related to churn, which also has the impact of reducing sales across the entire market because you have less flow. And so, inside the third quarter, one of the reasons our marketing and sales cost was so low, despite the significant growth that we had, was tied to that very fact. So, I think you're going to see a mixed bag inside of next year as it relates to ARPU impacts from promotional pricing roll off. On top of that, I would argue that the biggest driver of our ARPU development really is less about the individual PSU pricing at roll off and it ties much more to the amount of single play sell-in. And so, that's the biggest driver that's going on together with the video to tier mix. So, when you think about our success in selling spectrum stream and choice and essentials products, has a bigger impact than the mix that you were referring to. On the homes passed, when we do new construction to patents is what we call brownfield or greenfield, but we have pretty steady penetration curves over each vintage, if you want to call it that, of what we're building. And that's what gives us a lot of confidence to go do more of it because we can see at a high level of consistency in terms of our ability to get to very-high terminal penetrations when we build into markets. And so, that's what gives us confidence in our ability to go extend that investment concept. I don't know if that's helpful in answering the question, but we like the penetration, the speed and the curve of the penetration that we're getting in these new passings. So, Craig, why don't I take the first one and Tom could grab the second. I don't have the number in front of me, but it's not the material driver for our net additions, the new passings construction. It's been relatively small when you consider that compared to our 52 million passings overall. It's helpful, but it's not the material driver of our growth. A simple way to think about it is, if you think about greenfield new construction anywhere historically, past couple of years, has been 500,000 to 600,000 homes. And so, that gives you what you would need to go model and say apply an adoption curve to that number of passings and you can get to a number. And what you'd see is it's meaningful but it's not material to our overall internet net additions growth rate. There is an interesting stat attached to that is related is we really don't sell video. We sell a package of connectivity service. If you asked how many video single play do you sell? It's about 5% of our video sales are coming through in single play. So, we really don't sell video. We sell that as an application or a service attached to the connectivity service. Yes. We're not providing that I think for competitive purposes, but we're saying it's been declining, and that hasn't changed. We've just sold more broadband, which is why we have more video. And as it relates to the CBRS build-out, it's really a function of a few variables. One is the number of subscribers that you have. The more you have, the more economical build would be the usage of those subscribers, the amount of WiFi offload that you can get already, what is your rate on MVNO, and what's your density in the build cost. And as Tom mentioned, we wouldn't be building just to build a network. We'd be building tied to a guaranteed effectively cost reduction. And so, the ROI is not only relatively quick, but it's very clear, and there's very low risk. And so, we're not building any inside-out strategy just to have a network or for other network type build reasons, other than cost reduction. And, I don't think that it's going to be material in the short term. I think, it will occur for a many multiyear period. And you could argue that as the mobile retail store build-out declines for mobile that could be substituted over time with some additional build-out, which has a direct correlation to cost reduction. And as we start to do that, we're not doing that yet. We'll probably provide a little more color on what we think the effective payback of that is. But, I think the thing you should take comfort is that we're not building just to build, and it's going to be tied to a clear cost reduction in ROI. Thank you, everyone."

            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. Despite the significant challenges that COVID-19 has posed, we've been able to operate our business throughout the pandemic. Early in the pandemic, we offered our customers a set of programs, including our Remote Education Offer, and Keep America Connected Pledge that supported customers' needs, resulting in a significantly higher number of customers enjoying our services. In addition, we opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use, opened up our Spectrum News websites to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information, rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to healthcare providers and donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video subscribers. Our employees were given additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and a flex time program to address other COVID issues. We also increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by a $1.50 an hour, and we remain on path to a $20 minimum wage by 2022. Our ability to operate for our customers and communities, despite the challenging environment is a testament to the quality of our in-sourced and onshore workforce, our safety precautions, and in many cases, our ability to operate remotely. Our ads -- our sales and care agents have continued to sell our products and to provide outstanding service to our customers. Most of our stores have been able to remain open throughout the pandemic, serving customers' need. Our field operations personnel have handled professional installations and repairs, have continued their work in the field, servicing customers in their homes and maintaining the quality of our physical plant. Our plant construction has continued and we've actually seen plant miles and passings increase more this year than last. And our product development team has continued to develop and roll out various product improvements, including updates, enhancements to our video, internet and mobile products. Our ability to continue to operate well under the circumstances is also the result of investments we've made in various parts of our business over the last several years, including our investments in systems integrations and automation, our self-installation program, which ran at over 80% of installations during the quarter, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms, and our network including DOCSIS 3.1, which provides ample bandwidth to withstand surge in use with residential data usage for internet-only customers remaining at an elevated 600 gigabytes per month during the third quarter. Our operating and investment strategy has allowed us to sustain and accelerate our customer and financial growth. During the quarter, we added 537,000 residential and small business internet customers versus 380,000 in the prior year quarter. In the past 12 months, we've added 2.3 million internet customers and 2 million overall customer relationships. We're growing well and gaining share against all our competitors in all of our markets, regardless of competitive infrastructure. In the third quarter, we grew our mobile lines by 363,000, 87,000 more than in the third quarter of last year and continued acceleration from last quarter. We recently purchased 210 CBRS priority access licenses in 106 counties across all our key DMAs for just over $460 million. Over a multi-year period, we'll execute on our inside-out strategy with small cells attached to our existing network, using unlicensed, and now our licensed spectrum, based on the disciplined return-on-investment approach, consistent with our goal of reducing mobile operating costs. Turning to the third quarter financials. We grew consolidated EBITDA by over 13%, and our third quarter free cash flow grew by nearly 40% year-over-year. Looking forward and subject to what happens with the virus, unemployment stimulus, we expect our broadband and mobile products to continue to drive demand and churn and growth to return to pre-pandemic levels. SMB has actually performed better than we expected. And our ability to grow will also be partly tied to the economy. In enterprise, retail sales activity is picking back up, despite limited onsite access, and those new sales getting installed in the coming -- as those new sales get installed in the coming months, we expect enterprise revenue growth to pick back up. Our advertising business is improving, and our core ad business excluding political is about 90% back to normal in part because of the amount of sporting events that are now airing. So, core ad sales are improving, and we still expect political advertising to be meaningfully contribute -- a meaningful contributor in the fourth quarter. To maintain that growth, we'll continue to invest in our networks, so that we can continue to offer new and better products than our competitors. In the coming years, we expect data usage per customer to continue to grow, and we're prepared to deliver more throughput across our network. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth of IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the number of growing IP devices connected to our network, which is nearing 400 million devices. And new and emerging products and services are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning or telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats for example. We're continuously increasing the capacity in our core and hubs, and augmenting the network to improve speeds and performance. In the near-term, however, we have a large opportunity to improve throughput and latency by continuing to use already deployed DOCSIS 3.1 technology, which still has a long runway. And additional bandwidth tools available to us today include the conversion of the distribution network to DOCSIS 3.1 delivery for all products including video broadband and telephony. By allocating more plant spectrum to DOCSIS 3.1 IP services, we have the ability to offer symmetrical gigabit-plus speeds. We'll also continue to invest in DOCSIS 4.0 with key vendors in the rest of the industry for even greater capacity and functionality. The DOCSIS 4.0 specification allows for multiple paths through each 10-gig and higher speeds, including Full Duplex DOCSIS Extended Spectrum DOCSIS, Both 3.1 and 4.0 DOCSIS can be deployed in an economically efficient way as the market dictates. Our network evolution strategy allows us to offer superior connectivity products to meet changing consumer demand and extend our growth strategy and drive free cash flow. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd once again like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work, dedication and diligence throughout the pandemic. They've been asked to go above and beyond their regular duties, and they have delivered. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Well, John, how do we compete with -- we have -- it's not just the products, but the products do matter, and it's obviously what you're selling as a product, how much capacity, how much speed, how much throughput, what the reliability is, but also how well you service it and how efficient you are at delivering the product. And so, we're competitive with the infrastructure that we have against all of the various competitive infrastructures we go against, fiber, fixed wireless, satellite and copper-based high-capacity networks. And so, our network is highly capable. It's easy to augment from a capital investment point of view. It's very efficient to augment. And we keep our product sets and our service sets better than our competitors, and we prevail in most -- almost everywhere we operate. How do I think about that going forward with fixed wireless? I think that all of the various opportunities for competition require significant capital investment by our competitors. And I think, our network sets up better from a capital investment perspective, going forward, so that we can provide more capacity and more capability at lower costs than our competitors. So, it's a very competitive environment. There's a lot of different ways of making the competition work. But, I think, our network has superior capabilities to properly manage. Okay, Ben. So, how does the network work? Right now, we actually run three -- actually more than three, but three major networks inside of one physical infrastructure. So, we have DOCSIS 3.1, which is a -- which we use capacity to deliver IP-based services to specific modems households and customers. We also have a DOCSIS 3.0 infrastructure inside of our network, and we have a QAM-based video infrastructure. Most of the network is still dedicated by QAM-based video, the traditional cable TV service, and delivered to consumers that way. So, you can actually -- and today, we have multiple ways of delivering video to our customers and other services. And we have 10 million app-based streaming products -- devices connected to our network where the customer has downloaded an app, and we're feeding that approximately -- our app, with a full bundle of video packages, and the consumer brings their own device. We also have a significant distribution of QAM-based traditional cable TV services. And we are planning on mixing the two together in the same device. And we do -- for instance, we have Netflix on our set-top boxes in a device we provide, but it's actually being delivered through a different path to the box. So, the box will look at video from the traditional cable TV path, and we'll also look at the new IP paths and combine them together in a seamless experience for the customer. So, we have the ability to manage CPE and customers through time and manage the way we use our network in an efficient way to provide a full range of services. And with regard to MPEG, even if we deliver IP video, we'll -- as we do, we still use MPEG to do it. That's the digital format of videos in. And there is an opportunity through compression going from MPEG-2, which is still widely distributed by us to MPEG-4. And there's opportunity through the addition of products to what we call switch to video, which can be either IP or MPEG, traditional QAM-based MPEG. And we can manage how much is switched, how much is an MPEG 2, how much is in QAM, how much is in DOCSIS 3.0 and how much is in DOCSIS 3.1 and actually run all of that at the same time. So, we have a lot of room. And, I think the key takeaway is that traditional video is still the largest single -- it's more than half the capacity of the infrastructure. Okay. That's the key point. Yes, got it. The other thing I would add just in terms of longer run trends, yes, COVID had some impact on broadband adoption, but so does the change in the video business that's going on rapidly. And as more and more people are using IP-connected devices to bring video services that traditionally would have been delivered either over the air or by cable. That increases overall demand for broadband in the home. And I think, that also is simultaneously going on. So, you have a sort of overall demand change as a result of what's really going on in video. And so, I don't know that it changes adoption rates so much going forward. But, as it just shifted the entire amount of people that would be interested in having in-home broadband service, which kind of ties into John's question about the suitability of wireless access over time, when you have that kind of throughput going through. I agree. Well, if you look at our overall connectivity growth as Charter versus the industry, we have higher and faster connectivity growth, generally speaking, to the industry. And as a result of that, we're pulling through video with that growth. If you just think about overall video penetration, as a percentage of households and you think about changing households over to your network, you're going to pull through a certain percentage of video. And if you grow fast enough, you'll grow video, as a result of that. And we said that in the last call in terms of why we think our video growth is positive. We don't think that the overall video marketplace has changed, meaning we still think fat bundles is a very expensive video or under pressure and will continue to be. And so, you're going to have continued erosion of that bundle we think through time. But,, we're just growing faster than that erosion. With regard to ad sales, I'll let Chris answer that. But, I want to say one thing about local businesses. They are under duress. But, our SMB growth rate is higher this year than it was last year in the third quarter. And so, we're actually seeing a lot of -- yes, there's a lot of damage out there, but there's also a lot of reinvention and a lot of new business formation at the very small business level, and we're taking advantage of that. The other quick way to think about mobile is, yes, it's EBITDA positive going forward, and it's -- and as it's currently priced. But, if you grow mobile rapidly as we are, you'll grow your broadband rapidly too. Yes. I'd say, it's meaningful, but not material. Yes. I agree with that. Promotional, our basic proposition when you think about wireless is that we can save consumers a lot of money. And if you look at the average wireless bill most households are paying, they can connect to us and buy the right package from us and save a significant amount of household spend, telecom spend, and reallocate that to us. That's our primary objective. And we don't -- we have the ability to switch customers over who already have a wireless account to our product. And, we're not driven by new hardware for the consumer to drive our business. The consumer can bring their hardware with them and connect to us and save money. And so, yes, we're oriented toward making our price successful in the marketplace and we'll have to compete with that price. But, we already have a significant price discount to what most people are paying for their wireless service. And as a result of that, we've had accelerating growth in wireless connections. And so, we're offering real value to consumers and real overall savings by having them connect to us, both for their broadband and their wireless products. Yes, more time in the salt mine. Thank you very much. It's very kind of you to say. Yes. So, I mean, the attach rate of video to broadband has been declining steadily. And that's because the overall penetration of video -- traditional video is declining steadily. And so, the reason we are growing video isn't because that ratio has changed. It's because we're growing broadband faster and therefore pulling some video through with it. Yes. And with regard to your second question, maybe I wasn't clear -- go ahead. And so, this inside out strategy and how do we use spectrum? And, can you put it in the house? Interestingly, our WiFi capabilities and available spectrum for WiFi has continued to improve. The FCC has just granted significant amounts of WiFi spectrum to the public for use. And we plan to use that spectrum inside dwellings. And so, when we think about spectrum and the spectrum we recently got with CBRS, it's can you augment your WiFi spectrum with the CBRS spectrum to move traffic onto your own network that you might be paying someone else to carry. And the answer is yes. And you can do that in an efficient way, depending on the location and where you put the radio in such a way that you can actually reduce your overall cost. And as a result of that cost reduction, you get a return on investment on the capital you spend on both the spectrum and the radios that you've deployed. There are applications where CBRS spectrum or WiFi spectrum used differently than it has in the past can be used in enterprise connectivity using a 5G factory kind of notions where you would control the inside of a building using spectrum. So, there are individual products where you would want to have multiple radios, potentially, in the same environment. Whether you need to do that in a household in the short run or not is not that clear because there's so much WiFi spectrum available. But there are applications I can think of like farms and other places like that where CBRS could cover the whole property, 100 acres or 500 acres of property or even more for connectivity services. So, it's a tool. We look at spectrum as a tool to extend the connectivity, and we plan to use it in ways where it takes our cost structure down. So, Bryan, on the HFC plant, we think that there's a lot of capacity in the HFC plant, both downstream and upstream. And we think that given the current marketplace and utilization behaviors of consumers that we have plenty of upstream capacity. And we have a pathway using DOCSIS 3.1 technology and later, 4.1 technology to continue to increase that. And we have a vision that in the event that there is a transformative product set that needs upstream that would create value for consumers and then for us that we could fairly rapidly upgrade our plant to get a massive change in upstream capability. So, we build with fiber on the increment because it's cheaper. But, we think that the HFC plant can be equal to fiber from a capability, latency, capacity perspective, for years to come. And we think that with relatively small capital investments compared to replacement cost new, which is what fiber is, that we can upgrade the network and be competitive for a very-long period of time. Yes. The thing I would add to it is, yes, we have the $460 million of cost for CBRS spectrum. But the incremental capital is very specific to the location and the amount of traffic that we would save in essentially radio by radio kind of investment. It doesn't require building out a complete footprint. It's actually opportunistic by location. I don't know that I can answer that directly, except to say this. We track what our customers do with their video products. And we also track how they rate our applications and what their customer experience is and what our availability of content is to sell to the consumer. And we try to mix and match that in a way that we create the overall value and the relationship we have with the customer, but also create a product that makes money. And we've had some success in managing new ways of delivering video. As I said, we have over 10 million users who are getting their service through applications as opposed through traditional hardware. And so, we look at the business is evolving. We think that people will continue to buy rich packages for years to come, but we also think there are other opportunities to sell a variety of video services to consumers in different formats and that we can improve the customer experience by being a good place for consumers to interact with us to get those video services. And so, we're working toward that, and we're making some success. And we're actually optimistic in the very long term about our video business. Thank you, all."

I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead, sir.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter's Second Quarter 2020 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nThomas Rutledge: Thanks, Stefan. We've remained focused on serving our customers and the communities where we operate through a difficult period of time. These services have enabled remote working, distant learning, telehealth services and family communications in support of the broader economy and the welfare of our communities. In mid-March, as part of our effort to keep Americans connected during the shelter-in-place orders, we pledged to do a number of things. We committed to offer Spectrum Internet for free for 60 days to households with students or educators who did not already have a Spectrum Internet subscription. And through that program, which ended for new subscriptions on June 30, we added 450,000 customers. We also committed to suspend collection activities and not terminate service for residential or small and medium business customers who are experiencing COVID-19-related economic challenges. And through the Keep Americans Connected programs, which also ended on June 30, we helped approximately 700,000 customers who indicated economic hardship due to COVID-19. In addition, we opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use, opened up our Spectrum News website to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information, and we rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers. We've donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video subscribers. And for our employees, we implemented 2 weeks of additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and an additional 15 days of flex time to address other COVID issues. We increased our wages for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by $1.50 in April going back to February and committed to raise our minimum wage for hourly workers to at least $20 an hour over the next 2 years. We continued to perform well in the second quarter. We added 850,000 residential and SMB Internet customers driven by the demand for our high-quality products. Our ability to connect and service the customers we created in the quarter has been the result of investments that we've made over the last several years in our in-sourced and U.S.-based high-quality workforce, significant systems integration and automation, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms and our self-installation program, which ran at about 90% of installations during the quarter. Data usage and traffic in our network also remained elevated during the quarter. In June, residential data usage for Internet-only customers was 600 gigabytes per month, down 10% from the April peak, but up nearly 20% from the fourth quarter. Our customers are benefiting from a continually decreasing price per gigabyte. Peak traffic levels remain well below maximum capacity. And our network continued to perform well because of the capacity that our recent investments, including all-digital and DOCSIS 3.1, created and because we continue to invest significantly to stay ahead of that usage curve. Over the coming years, we'll invest in our network as we build to lower density in rural communities and pursue our 10g plan, which provides a cost-efficient pathway for us to offer multi-gigabit speeds and lower latency to consumers and business customers. Additionally, with our inside-out strategy, we will continue to use and develop small wireless cells powered by our network together with our MVNO to connect customers in and beyond the home, delivering our throughput and economics for customers in fixed, nomadic and mobile environments. Moving back to Q2 results. We added 100,000 video and 40,000 voice customers, both of which benefited from significant broadband sales in the quarter. We also added 325,000 mobile lines despite some disruption to our mobile sales channel in the quarter. We also performed well from a financial perspective. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.3% despite some nonrecurring items Chris will cover. And our second quarter free cash flow grew by nearly 70% year-over-year. As we look out for the rest of the year, we expect our broadband and mobile products to continue to drive demand. But our outlook depends on what happens to unemployment and income and for how long and the impact such factors have on customers' ability to pay for those services in the coming months, including government support to consumers. Household formation may slow. If it does, we would expect lower activity for both new sales and churn. And due to our various self-installation initiatives, we expect service transactions and costs to serve per customer relationship to continue to decline. SMB has held up better than we expected, and we're currently selling more year-over-year, again tied to how the economy and stimulus develops. In Enterprise, business has been slow. During the second quarter, we struggled to gain access to customers and business premises. Sales activity is picking up back each month, but it will continue to be lower growth until businesses are fully back to normal operations. Our advertising business is inherently local and primarily supported by small and medium businesses, which have also been slow to return to local advertising. Ad sales are improving, and we still expect political advertising to be meaningful, which will help our third and fourth quarter results. Our first half financial results would have been better were it not for COVID-19. But we feel good about our current performance and long-term growth trajectory. The value and demand for our services is clear, and we're operating efficiently and serving our communities well. In 2016, we put 3 cable companies together to scale our business under 1 operating strategy. Our ability to grow our connectivity services this year for both new and existing customers is a testament to our operating strategy, the quality of our products and our significant investment in systems and people over the last several years. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work, dedication and diligence throughout this crisis. They've been asked to go above and beyond their regular duties, and they've delivered, easing the strain for millions of families in this challenging time. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. Now turning to customer results on Slide 5 of our presentation. Including the impact of COVID-19-related customer offers and retention programs, we grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.8 million over the last 12 months or by 6.3% and by 755,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 850,000 in the quarter and by over 2.1 million or 8.3% over the last 12 months. Video grew by 94,000 in the quarter, better than last year's second quarter decline of 141,000 video customers. The positive performance was driven by churn benefits at a time when consumer demand was high as well as the pull-through effect of our COVID programs. Wireline voice grew by 45,000, also benefiting from the same likely temporary factors as video. Mobile net adds accelerated again to 325,000. Beginning in mid-March, we introduced 3 COVID-19-related offers and programs for our customers. Each of these offers ended on June 30. As we did in our first quarter materials, we had provided an addendum showing the customer counts for each of these 3 COVID-related offers as of the end of the second quarter. The first was our Remote Education Offer, which provided 60 days of free Internet for new Internet customers with students or educators in the household. Over 90% of these customers are on our flagship speed tier or higher. This channel looked very much like traditional acquisition with nearly 50% having subscribed to and paid for additional products along the way. At the end of the first quarter, we reported 119,000 internet customers in the offer, which rolled off either as paying customers or disconnects during Q2. For Q2, net of some small in-quarter roll-off churn, we added 329,000 more Internet customers to the 60-day free program, with 160,000 remaining on the free offer at the end of Q2. And by July 27, 90% of the cumulative connects on this program from Q1 all the way through Q2 remained as either paying customers or still on the free offer within the 60 days. The second offer or customer category in the addendum reflects customers who participated in our Keep Americans Connected Pledge to the FCC. These are customers who indicated their inability to pay for service for COVID-19-related reasons. This program protected, as Tom mentioned, approximately 700,000 residential and SMB customers from collections and disconnect activity through June 30. 60% of these customers were -- continued to pay something, half of which were paid in full. And at the peak, there were over 200,000 who would have been disconnected under our normal collection practices. In an effort to assist COVID-19-impacted customers with overdue balances, we waived $85 million of receivables, which was recorded as a reduction of revenue in the second quarter. As a result, these customers no longer have an overdue balance. We believe that we'll retain most as long-term customers, but some of the over 200,000 may become disproportionately delinquent compared to a typical customer with disconnection in late Q3 or more likely in Q4 under our normal disconnect practices. Early payment trends on this base is, however, very good. The final category of customers we've isolated in our addendum are SMB and enterprise customers who requested a seasonal suspension of service or temporary downgrade of a line of service while their operations were closed or diminished. I don't expect there will be anything to report as an addendum in Q3 given these programs have effectively wrapped up. So how do we think about customer relationship performance in 2020 given COVID-19 in our various programs? Well, in the beginning of Q1, our customer relationship growth was accelerating, and our pre-COVID expectation was that would continue throughout 2020. In March and the second quarter, we absorbed a tremendous amount of new connection and service volume, providing free service and credits. Our goal was to do our part in helping customers in our local communities through a difficult economic period. As of the third quarter, we have a lot of customers who now have high-quality, attractively priced connectivity services from us. And our third quarter and fourth quarter performance will largely be a function of the economy, unemployment and any additional stimulus packages. It is clear to us that the actions we took to connect and protect customers during the crisis will result in long-term benefits for Charter, better-ending relationships in 2020, and we expect a higher customer growth rate this year compared to last. So our success in the second half of 2020 will be measured on third and fourth quarter year-to-date for last 12 months' net additions comparisons, not a particular quarterly comparison, which is consistent with how we manage the business. Turning to the financials. As we expected, there were a lot of moving parts in the quarter. I'll be referencing various COVID-related items, which we've laid out on Slide 9 of today's presentation. Residential revenue grew by 4.1% in the quarter primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth and similar PSU bundle and video mix trends we have seen over several quarters. This growth rate includes the negative impact of $76 million of onetime write-down for residential customers in the Keep Americans Connected program. SMB revenue grew by 2% given slower customer growth and $17 million of write-downs and credits for customers in the Keep Americans Connected and the COVID-related seasonal plan. That created some temporary ARPU pressure. So far, we've been pleased with our SMB performance. And while things can definitely change if local economies shut back down, early third quarter SMB sales and net addition performance has actually been better year-over-year. Spectrum Enterprise revenue declined by 7.1% year-over-year driven by the sale of NaviSite and the continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. Excluding both NaviSite and cell tower backhaul, Enterprise grew by 2.2%. That includes $18 million in onetime credits, which we extended to certain customers in return for contract extensions. While the comparability for NaviSite goes away after Q3, wholesale, in particular cell tower backhaul, continues to be challenged. Retail Enterprise, when excluding the $18 million of onetime bill credits, is growing revenue around 7%, but sustaining that growth or accelerating will be difficult until our customers are back to normal operations. We also have some exposure to the hotel segment, which we've tried to deal with in the second quarter. Spectrum Reach second quarter advertising revenue declined by 37% driven by the COVID pandemic, which reduced core ad sales growth. In April, sales were about 50% of prior year. May was about 60% of the prior year. And June was about 70% of prior year. So the trend has been improving, but our core won't be fully back to normal until later in the year or early next year. Of course, we will benefit from political along the way, which will help the prior year comparison. Mobile revenue totaled $310 million with $158 million of that being device revenue. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 3.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expense. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $45 million or 0.6% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses, excluding mobile, declined by 1.3% year-over-year or 0.8%, excluding NaviSite. Programming increased 1.6% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we've seen in prior quarters. We did not accrue any RSN fee savings in our programming expenses in the second quarter as the certainty, amount and timing of any credits is not yet clear. If and when any COVID rebate for lost games occurs, we will pass that along to our video customers with no or minimal expected EBITDA impact. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by 18.3% year-over-year primarily driven by a $125 million benefit from the timing of sports rights payments for our Dodgers and Lakers RSNs, which have been pushed out to the second half and later depending on the sport and adjusted season. Costs to service customers increased by 4.6% year-over-year with meaningful productivity compared to 6.3% customer relationship growth. The higher level of expense growth was driven by record levels of transaction volume ranging from acquisition, upgrades, billing and service. And that expense includes roughly $44 million for recently accelerated hourly wage increases and COVID-19 benefits, which Tom mentioned, partially offset by lower medical costs and a onetime payroll tax credit. Bad debt expense was essentially flat year-over-year but some $48 million lower than what we would have expected based on higher customer counts and the unemployment rate. This quarter, bad debt benefited from the significant revenue write-off for customers who were in the protection program and generally better payment trends due to the stimulus package under the CARES Act. Bad debt going forward will be a function of the economy and any new stimulus package. Excluding bad debt variability, costs to service customers should continue to grow at a slower rate than customer relationship growth due to lower transaction volume and higher self-service trends despite the step-up in minimum wages and COVID flextime. Cable marketing expenses declined by 6.3% year-over-year given better media placement rates and a onetime payroll tax credit. Other expense declined by 6.6% year-over-year primarily due to lower advertising sales cost, costs related to NaviSite, which was sold, travel and insurance costs. Mobile expenses totaled $413 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage cost and operating expenses. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.3% in the quarter when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $103 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.7%, including a 2.7% negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue, net of its associated expense in both periods. We generated $766 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, and capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter. Our second quarter capital expenditure shows we continued to invest through the second quarter despite a disruptive environment. We invested significantly in continued capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of contention, and we didn't slow down on new build, including construction in rural areas. Obviously, the level of broadband installations drove much higher modem and router purchases and self-installation kits. We expect 2020 cable capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year, and the underspend relative to our original plan that I mentioned last quarter may not be as significant as a result of the now much higher growth rates. We generated close to $1.9 billion in consolidated free cash flow in the quarter. And excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $2.1 billion of cable free cash, up about $700 million versus last year's second quarter. We finished the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. And as of the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3x or 4.2x if you look at cable only. So we delevered a bit in Q2. Earlier this month, we issued $3 billion of long-dated, high-yield debt at very attractive rates. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our current run rate annualized cash interest is $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1.2 billion at an average price of $499 per share. We completed a lower amount of buybacks in Q2 than we did in Q1 as we wanted to survey both defensive and offensive opportunities in a unique climate. Our visibility to various scenarios surrounding COVID-19 has obviously improved. We will always evaluate the best use of our capital to generate long-term return for shareholders be it organic investments, such as the launch of our mobile or network edge-outs, purchasing someone else's shares or our own and probably in that order in terms of preference. And we remain comfortable in the middle or high end of our target leverage range. As I mentioned last quarter, we know that we have a high-quality, resilient asset with dedicated employees across our local communities, and we've invested significantly in our network and our people over the years. We also know there's a high demand for our product across every part of our footprint in both homes and businesses in good times and in bad, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network is well invested, ready and working for future opportunities. As the environment continues to evolve across the 41 states where we operate, our goal is to stay focused on what we do well and execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees across various economic and regulatory climates to create shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Two quick ones, if I may, Chris. Firstly, can you give us just a little bit more color on how you think the third quarter in particular but really the rest of the year will unfold as it relates to some of the COVID-related benefits and costs you saw? So specifically, it sounds like there are about 360,000 subs still on various offers. Do you think that will -- could translate into higher churn in 3Q? And then is there any more write-offs for revenues or negative bad debt impacts you anticipate from the initiatives that we've seen so far, not taking into consideration anything that happens with the economy and the macro environment? And then we were interested to see that you guys registered for the RDOF subsidies. You've been growing households at close to or passing it close to 2% recently. If you're successful in those auctions, what could that potentially increase to?\nChristopher Winfrey: Why don't I start with the last one first? We're in a quiet period as it relates to the RDOF, and so we won't be commenting any further than what we've already said in the 8-K. The first one, and I'll give a shot at it here and then Tom may want to chime in as well, is the programs that we had in place have wrapped up as of June 30. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the customers that we created through the end of the first quarter and the second quarter on the Remote Education Offer, so all those net -- all those gross additions that came through, 90% of them are still with us, and the vast majority of them are paying and 50% of whom altogether had actually taken additional products from us and were paying along the way. So I don't have a crystal ball. But so far, they look every bit as good as regular-way acquisitions. They're not a low-tier package from us. Over 90% of them are in the flagship product. And then while there's risk attached to any of that because of the programs we've put, so far we don't see it. We're just putting it out there that we're watching it and so far it looks very good on the Remote Education Offer.\nThomas Rutledge: I would just add that from a profile perspective, they look just like our regular customer base, and they are like our customer base. And the 50% that bought video or voice from us or mobile went through the normal credit check process that all customers go through. So they very much are behaving like all customers that we create. And I look at that offer in a lot of ways as a conventional promotional offer with a broadband benefit associated with it for 2 months, but it brought in new -- real new customers that subscribe and look like existing customers.\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes. And then the other program was Keep Americans Connected. At the peak, we had 200,000 customers who had gone beyond the point where we normally would have disconnected the customer. We've written off the balance for anybody who had an extended balance. So that was the $85 million that I mentioned. So by the time we got to July, all of those customers were in good standing partly because some of them had been paying along the way and partly because we wrote off. Now those that were written off revenue, as we sit here today, and we looked at those that cycled through the June billing cycle, they're paying and they're paying at a very good rate. And so if we had to sit here today, we'd say it looks very much like regular customer and customer churn. The caveat that we've put out there is obviously, there's a fair amount of stimulus that's been in -- a federal economic stimulus that's been in the environment, and we don't know what that's going to look like. We don't know how COVID is going to continue to develop. And nonpay will develop going forward, as it normally would with how the economy goes and how stimulus goes along with it.\nThomas Rutledge: And the way I would describe the macroeconomic risk factors going forward is that they apply to the entire business just like they apply to the customers that we had created in this quarter, and we don't see a big difference in the customer base that we created in the quarter and the average customer base.\nChristopher Winfrey: The final question that you asked, Jonathan, was do we see any more revenue write-off or exceptional bad debt later this year. No, none attached to any of these programs. To the extent that what we just talked about if the economy is difficult and there isn't stimulus, would we expect a higher nonpay rate in that environment which would result in bad debt? Yes, but that would be the same for any business. And that'd be the same for us in any environment where you have the economy which is more difficult.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick: First, Chris, can you dig into the video strength? Well, I assume the inflection was pull-through from customers coming in on some kind of promotion for broadband and taking that video as well. With that program done, should we assume video trends return to normal going forward? And then second, Tom, your contract expires next year. Can you give us an idea? Do you plan to keep running the company after that? Or give us any update on how you and the Board think about succession planning?\nThomas Rutledge: Sure. All right, well, I'm going to answer both of your questions. So video is a -- the secular trends for video haven't changed. What happened is that we've always said that we thought it was possible to grow video if our overall relationship growth was high enough because there still are a -- the ratio of video customers to overall customers, it is continuing to decline, but it's -- if you grow fast enough -- if you grow faster than that rate of decline, then you create video growth. And that's really what's happened here. Nothing has changed the secular trend, although there probably was a little less downgrading during the period because so many people were stuck in front of screens at home. But I don't think the overall trend has changed. What really just happened is we accelerated our growth rate overall in customer relationships. And as a result of that -- and the shift in share, some of the video -- we grew faster than the rate of video decline, and it's that simple. In the past, we said we thought that we're -- that satellite would decline and that we could grow fast enough to have small video growth. Overall, growth declined faster than I thought it would over the last several years, but it's still -- I would say that, that trend has not changed. All that changed was we grew our overall relationships faster. And with regard to me, I intend to continue to be here, and the Board would like me to stay.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson: So a question for Chris. You used plain English and I know you're specific with your comments, but I'm still going to ask for a clarification on the comments on offensive opportunities being reviewed in 2Q, and I think you said in this order: purchase someone else's shares versus purchasing our own. So should we read that as the company's reviewing and interested in M&A at a higher level than previously? And then Tom in his prepared remarks mentioned investing in the networks. Is that emphasis on investing in the networks suggesting a different outlook for CapEx than previously stated? Or is that just within the profile that you've previously set?\nChristopher Winfrey: And thanks, Doug. So there's really -- since Tom and I both have been here, there's no change in our prioritization of cash flow. We've always said the most attractive way to deploy your excess free cash flow is to invest in further growth opportunities inside the business. The second would be to acquire other companies which have a better rate of return than buying back your own stock. And the third would be to buy back your own stock. And the reason for that order is because it's -- if you can get the first 2 that I mentioned going, it actually enhances the quality and the return of the buybacks that you do, too. Our views on that haven't changed, so I was just reiterating that's how we think about it. And I don't think in Tom's comments we were trying to foreshadow any type of major capital increase. We just said that our philosophy has always been to invest in our networks. We've done so. It's -- you can see the benefit of having gotten in front of capacity needs well in advance and put us in a position to add this amount of subscribers. And there's no major change that we're signaling there other than we intend to continue to invest very, very well inside of our networks.\nThomas Rutledge: Yes. I wasn't saying that we were changing our profile investment strategy. I was merely commenting that we've been investing in capacity upgrades, and those capacity upgrades have served us well, and they serve the whole communications infrastructure of the country well. And you have a very competitive facilities-based market in the United States, and it results in very high-quality products, and it will result in future high-quality products.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: When we look at the success you had in the first half of the year with your broadband subscriber growth, one of the reasons is you identified a demographic, which is students and teachers, where it seems like you may have been particularly underpenetrated and you came up with this promo that was really made for the moment, and it worked. You still have very low broadband penetration relative to what I think you believe it's ultimately going to be, and so I'm wondering whether you think there's an opportunity on the heels of the REO program to come up with other promos that are uniquely appealing to other demographics where maybe that gap is a bit wider. And then just on the wireless. Obviously, the net adds there were very strong. I'm wondering if that's because there was a very high attach rate with the broadband ad that you had and, as a result, if broadband ads are going to be more moderate in the back half, we should also have the same outlook for more moderate wireless ads.\nThomas Rutledge: Well, to your implication, yes, if we could find ways to segment promotional activity that will result in faster growth, we will take advantage of those opportunities. And one of the reasons we were able to be successful with the promotion that we just did was our ability to not only do the promotion but to execute it and to actually install it in a very short order of time in a way that was convenient for customers using self-installation. And so yes, there's continued opportunity for acceleration. But that was a particularly successful result. And we will continue to explore opportunities going forward to accelerate growth from a marketing perspective, but we feel pretty good about our ability to continually grow and to continually -- and to -- and accelerate that growth, and nothing that has happened to date has dissuaded us from that perspective.\nChristopher Winfrey: And nothing to -- not to diminish our own prowess either, but if you think about the demographics of who has somebody in their household who can claim to be a student or claim to be an educator, it's a pretty broad segment of the population. It was just a very attractive offer that was out at a point in time where people needed it, and it was a good opportunity to create new...\nThomas Rutledge: It was not the majority of our sales by any means.\nChristopher Winfrey: No. But it's still created a new market and drove additional share shift.\nThomas Rutledge: It was a nice -- and it fit the moment.\nBrett Feldman: The other question was whether the wireless adds that we created in the second quarter were also tied similar to video or voice as a function of the broadband growth. And would that indicate that the second half of this year, wireless net adds could be less if we had less broadband growth?\nThomas Rutledge: Oh, I think no.\nChristopher Winfrey: I don't either.\nThomas Rutledge: The way we look at the mobile growth opportunity, it's really a function of activity levels and how often we get a chance to communicate with our customers about mobile and what the rate of that attach rate is. And that continues to improve. And it's a relatively new business for us, and we are continuing to improve our tactics at that business and we're continuing to get improvement every week in terms of our results. And so we have high expectations for continued growth in that area.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Chris, I don't know if you can give us color now, maybe some uncertainty, but do you expect any benefit or a shift in -- or a year-over-year impact on the sports rights front in the third quarter around the Dodgers and Lakers? You mentioned it was delayed, but I do think there have been games that have been canceled. So just curious if we should be thinking about that. And then maybe for Tom. Are you thinking about accelerating your sort of network evolution over time? I know you talked about not changing your CapEx profile in general. But scalable infrastructure, I noticed, ticked up. You talked about getting ahead of contention. I think you mentioned 10G. The business is throwing off tons of free cash flow. I'm just wondering if -- do you think about where you want the network to be wired and wireless over time? Are you thinking about trying to bring that forward just to take advantage of all the opportunities the company has?\nThomas Rutledge: Yes. It was -- sort of in broad terms, yes, we want to continue to take advantage of the technological opportunity that the network provides us and the cost-efficient way to upgrade the network on a relative basis to what we think our competitors can do. And so to the extent that demand exists for new products or that demand can be created for new products and drive revenue associated with those new products, we want to upgrade our network to take advantage of that. And at the moment, we have a lot of capacity. And so I don't see, at the moment, our profile changing. But as a general notion, we think that with relatively efficient capital investments, we can continue to upgrade our network through time. And 10G is a reflection and a description of that opportunity. It's a cost-efficient upgrade platform that allows us to get to very high capacity, low latency on a relative basis more efficiently than anyone else.\nChristopher Winfrey: Ben, on your first question, the delayed Dodgers and Lakers costs from the first and the second quarter, they've been pushed out to varying degrees depending on the RSN and the sport and the adjusted season. But the biggest driver for the first half of this year is the P&L recognition of the Dodgers where we've paid the cash, but the expense for unplayed games will be amortized over the remaining life of the contract. So it's unlikely there'll be a large catch-up in the back half of this year. Now to the extent that there are programming rebates, those are very complex. And in most cases, we're not going to know for some time if we'll receive any rebates or credits back from the leagues. The same applies to programming networks on the programming cost side. But what we have said is to the extent that we do receive any rebates or credits for canceled games or programming -- on the programming expense line, so between rights and programming extra cost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll pass those along to the customers. So I don't see a material EBITDA impact, although it could put an offsetting revenue credit and expense credit to the extent it materializes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Two quick questions, if I could. First, I'll go back to the question about footprint expansion, maybe not in the context of the RDOF auction but just in general. Can you share with us how much of the broadband growth came from the 2.2% footprint expansion that you're seeing now year-over-year? And absent any benefit from the RDOF auction, how fast do you think that footprint expansion could go? And then just second, could you update us on the path to profitability for the wireless business and your current view of how profitable that business can be with the current contract and then how much traffic you think you might be able to offload onto your own facilities in a way to reduce those monthly variable costs?\nThomas Rutledge: Well, we're in a quiet period with regard to RDOF, Craig, but -- and also, our 2% passings growth rate includes new construction as well, meaning new home creation. And the bulk of that is that at this point in time. So...\nChristopher Winfrey: And maybe just to add on to it, those are -- homes passed are including what you count as marketable. So the extent that you're picking up additional homes maybe without even construction, we're building about 500,000, 600,000 a year. And so that's what you should think about as being added from a construction standpoint. It's not a material driver to our overall net adds inside of the quarter, and it hasn't been -- but as it builds up over time, it's obviously a cumulative effect as you start to penetrate those vintages of construction. But what we've done over the past year hasn't been a big driver for our broadband net add growth. But if you do enough of it over a prolonged period of time, it's snowballs.\nThomas Rutledge: It's good returns on investment capital spending over time. And it's -- the activity levels in the second quarter were similar to what they were planned for and what they were in the first quarter. So construction didn't actually slow down. And I'm talking about new home construction in the quarter.\nChristopher Winfrey: Craig, the profitability of wireless, our views on it hasn't changed. We're not dependent on any additional offload above and beyond the WiFi that we already utilize. And even under that rather limited model, our expectation continues to be that our breakeven, if you had no additional subscriber acquisition, so no marketing and sales cost, no cost of provisioning new customers, that the break-even point would be around 2 million lines. That's a bit of a fictitious or academic scenario because we're always going to be selling it, we're always going to be marketing. But that gives you a sense of where the business, absent growth, would break even.\nThomas Rutledge: We're rapidly approaching.\nChristopher Winfrey: Which we're rapidly approaching. So the economics of wireless are good. But like any start-up subscription business, it costs money to get going and you acquire customers, and they have a positive payback on every single one of them that we acquire. And so our views on the profitability hasn't changed. To the extent that we're able to improve the economics along the way, which we've talked about extensively in the past, that would make that even better, but we don't rely a ton on that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: I had one Tom and one for Chris. Tom, Charter recently requested the FCC waive 2 of the conditions related to the approval of the Time Warner Cable deal on data caps and paid peering. What's the motivation behind that request? And if it was granted, how would that impact the business in the future? And then, Chris, I was wondering if you could just give us some updated color on how you're thinking about working capital usage for 2020.\nThomas Rutledge: So Bryan, when we did the agreement with the FCC, it had -- it was a 7-year agreement. So those provisions go away automatically in 7 years, but there was a caveat in our agreement that allowed us to terminate it after 5 years if the marketplace indicated that those conditions were no longer relevant. And I would just describe our goal there as housekeeping, and -- because it's -- because the market didn't require those conditions and in my view never did, we wanted to get -- we wanted to put ourselves from an opportunity perspective on the same even playing field as all of our competitors. But we don't have any change in business strategy or marketing strategy or product strategy as a result of that request.\nChristopher Winfrey: And Bryan, on the working capital, if you think about the past 2 years, meaning 2018 and 2019, there were some pretty unique items that were taking place, whether it was the wind down of all-digital or last year we hinted a -- the big billing standardization project, which -- both of which had impacts on working capital. We haven't had anything like that. That's been abnormal this year. We do have large springs inside the quarter due to seasonality. You saw that inside of Q2 where we had a positive contribution to working capital. Last year, we had a negative one that was driven by that billing standardization which we talked about then. To give you an order of magnitude, there are days when we collect $300 million of cash in 1 day of collections. And so it's going to move around a little bit both inside of a quarter and for a full year based on the timing of your programming payments, the timing of your collections. And so I don't want to hoist ourselves here on our own petard and give a working capital forecast other than to say there's no major change this year that could cause us -- should cause us to be abnormal. And whether it's positive or negative by a few hundred million, it's not going to be a material driver to our free cash flow this year is my current expectation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Guggenheim Partners.\nMichael McCormack: Chris, maybe just a quick comment on the customers that are, I guess, at risk. When you look at the consumer versus the SMB piece of it, is there a different behavior or are there different behaviors between those 2 cohorts? And then maybe one for Tom, on the programming cost side. We're seeing in the last 12 months about 6.5 million subs come out of the video ecosystem. How does that change your thought process going forward, I guess, maybe in your own content strategy. And obviously, any thoughts about pushing back against the programmers? And then if you don't mind, just one last on Enterprise. Is that Enterprise weakness just delayed decision-making? Or are you actually seeing customer disconnects?\nThomas Rutledge: Okay. The last question, it's delayed decision-making.\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes. People in large enterprise, they're not in the office. And to the extent their IT people are, it hasn't been the time where they're most aggressively looking to save money and change providers and move to Spectrum. We're still making a fair amount of sales, and it's picking up every month, just getting back to a more normalized environment. But it's been depressed, and it's going to be probably until businesses -- enterprise businesses get back to normal operations. Maybe I'll take...\nThomas Rutledge: There's opportunity there...\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes, there is.\nThomas Rutledge: In creating new products and services for enterprise that -- and enterprise will use their telecommunications infrastructure in a different way, potentially going forward. So I think in the long run, there's more opportunity.\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes.\nThomas Rutledge: The question on the thought process around programming and whether or not the whole sort of ecosystem argues for a more aggressive stance or not, I think, is the implication of your question. I think that's coming. And at some point, somebody oversteps the bounds of reason and there'll be some sort of breakage that will occur.\nChristopher Winfrey: You had also asked about the difference between at-risk customers for nonpay as it relates to residential and SMB. On the residential side, we -- as I mentioned, we have a product that's in high demand, that's highly competitive. It's attractively priced. It's attractively packaged. And because of the way that we do all of that and operate, we don't -- there's going to be high demand for it. It's just a question of people's ability to pay. And there's some uncertainty around where does the economy go. And even if the economy is bad in an environment where you have a significant amount of stimulus, we tend to get paid very quickly in that environment because of the value of the product that we provide. So that's really how we think about the residential environment, is the economy and the level of stimulus. SMB, it's really a question of whether they're open for business or not and how -- if they're not open for business, how long can they sustain from their own liquidity perspective of not being in business. And that's the uncertainty that we face on that front. Otherwise, the quality of our products and our ability to go gain market share in an environment where people are looking for faster products at better prices, you would argue that -- if the share flow could actually increase in the SMB space for us along the way.\nThomas Rutledge: Yes. And Chris used -- sorry, Chris said that our SMB continues to accelerate over last year. And that's not just a function that businesses are back and working, but it's also a share shift function. And we're underpenetrated in SMB, and so our upside there is bigger than it is in residential from a market share perspective and we have the best products.\nMichael McCormack: And Chris, those percentages that you laid out as far as those that are paying, is that a residential-only number that you were referring to?\nChristopher Winfrey: I'm trying to remember which because I gave a lot of percentages today. So I gave the...\nMichael McCormack: I figured like 50% are paying something.\nChristopher Winfrey: No. That was residential in SMB. But the vast, vast majority of those unit -- if you take a look at the addendum we provided, the vast majority of those customers were in the residential space, and so it's heavily weighted towards residential. But it was both. It was both. And so 60% of customers have been making some payment, including partial payments, half of which -- or about 30% of the total base had been making full payment, and that included -- those stats included both residential and SMB.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie.\nTimothy Nollen: I'd like to come back to the video numbers. I just wanted to ask if you think your numbers are helped somewhat by what appears to be a bit more of a skinny bundle strategy that you offer rather than offering some more OTT services, OTT bundles as some of your competitors are doing.\nThomas Rutledge: The answer is yes. Yes, we have a range of video products, including a traditional bundle. And to some extent, in the long run, the skinny packages have limits in terms of what we can penetrate with because of the way the contract language works, our programming deals and the minimums that are required in the -- the minimum distribution required in a big bundle. So there's a challenge for us in balancing all of that that so far we've been successful in dealing with. But the answer is yes, and the challenges in video have not gone away.\nTimothy Nollen: And do you think you might be looking at offering some OTT types of one-offs or bundles within your video offering? Or is that something you're going to stay away from?\nThomas Rutledge: You mean -- I'm not sure I fully understand your question. But you mean are we willing to do additional packaging?\nTimothy Nollen: Yes. I'm not talking about skinny bundles in terms of traditional linear or skinny bundles, but things like offering an OTT service or offering an OTT bundle from a network rather than a skinny linear bundle.\nThomas Rutledge: Oh, Yes. Yes, absolutely. And I think you'll see us selling more and more packages of OTT product that we don't necessarily own but more on a consignment basis or on a -- potentially even a packaging basis.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Tim.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thanks, Tim.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, that completes our call.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Rutledge",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. We've remained focused on serving our customers and the communities where we operate through a difficult period of time. These services have enabled remote working, distant learning, telehealth services and family communications in support of the broader economy and the welfare of our communities. In mid-March, as part of our effort to keep Americans connected during the shelter-in-place orders, we pledged to do a number of things. We committed to offer Spectrum Internet for free for 60 days to households with students or educators who did not already have a Spectrum Internet subscription. And through that program, which ended for new subscriptions on June 30, we added 450,000 customers. We also committed to suspend collection activities and not terminate service for residential or small and medium business customers who are experiencing COVID-19-related economic challenges. And through the Keep Americans Connected programs, which also ended on June 30, we helped approximately 700,000 customers who indicated economic hardship due to COVID-19. In addition, we opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use, opened up our Spectrum News website to ensure people have access to high-quality local news and information, and we rapidly connected and upgraded fiber services to health care providers. We've donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our full footprint of 16 million video subscribers. And for our employees, we implemented 2 weeks of additional paid sick time for COVID-related illnesses and an additional 15 days of flex time to address other COVID issues. We increased our wages for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by $1.50 in April going back to February and committed to raise our minimum wage for hourly workers to at least $20 an hour over the next 2 years. We continued to perform well in the second quarter. We added 850,000 residential and SMB Internet customers driven by the demand for our high-quality products. Our ability to connect and service the customers we created in the quarter has been the result of investments that we've made over the last several years in our in-sourced and U.S.-based high-quality workforce, significant systems integration and automation, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms and our self-installation program, which ran at about 90% of installations during the quarter. Data usage and traffic in our network also remained elevated during the quarter. In June, residential data usage for Internet-only customers was 600 gigabytes per month, down 10% from the April peak, but up nearly 20% from the fourth quarter. Our customers are benefiting from a continually decreasing price per gigabyte. Peak traffic levels remain well below maximum capacity. And our network continued to perform well because of the capacity that our recent investments, including all-digital and DOCSIS 3.1, created and because we continue to invest significantly to stay ahead of that usage curve. Over the coming years, we'll invest in our network as we build to lower density in rural communities and pursue our 10g plan, which provides a cost-efficient pathway for us to offer multi-gigabit speeds and lower latency to consumers and business customers. Additionally, with our inside-out strategy, we will continue to use and develop small wireless cells powered by our network together with our MVNO to connect customers in and beyond the home, delivering our throughput and economics for customers in fixed, nomadic and mobile environments. Moving back to Q2 results. We added 100,000 video and 40,000 voice customers, both of which benefited from significant broadband sales in the quarter. We also added 325,000 mobile lines despite some disruption to our mobile sales channel in the quarter. We also performed well from a financial perspective. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.3% despite some nonrecurring items Chris will cover. And our second quarter free cash flow grew by nearly 70% year-over-year. As we look out for the rest of the year, we expect our broadband and mobile products to continue to drive demand. But our outlook depends on what happens to unemployment and income and for how long and the impact such factors have on customers' ability to pay for those services in the coming months, including government support to consumers. Household formation may slow. If it does, we would expect lower activity for both new sales and churn. And due to our various self-installation initiatives, we expect service transactions and costs to serve per customer relationship to continue to decline. SMB has held up better than we expected, and we're currently selling more year-over-year, again tied to how the economy and stimulus develops. In Enterprise, business has been slow. During the second quarter, we struggled to gain access to customers and business premises. Sales activity is picking up back each month, but it will continue to be lower growth until businesses are fully back to normal operations. Our advertising business is inherently local and primarily supported by small and medium businesses, which have also been slow to return to local advertising. Ad sales are improving, and we still expect political advertising to be meaningful, which will help our third and fourth quarter results. Our first half financial results would have been better were it not for COVID-19. But we feel good about our current performance and long-term growth trajectory. The value and demand for our services is clear, and we're operating efficiently and serving our communities well. In 2016, we put 3 cable companies together to scale our business under 1 operating strategy. Our ability to grow our connectivity services this year for both new and existing customers is a testament to our operating strategy, the quality of our products and our significant investment in systems and people over the last several years. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work, dedication and diligence throughout this crisis. They've been asked to go above and beyond their regular duties, and they've delivered, easing the strain for millions of families in this challenging time. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. I would just add that from a profile perspective, they look just like our regular customer base, and they are like our customer base. And the 50% that bought video or voice from us or mobile went through the normal credit check process that all customers go through. So they very much are behaving like all customers that we create. And I look at that offer in a lot of ways as a conventional promotional offer with a broadband benefit associated with it for 2 months, but it brought in new -- real new customers that subscribe and look like existing customers. And the way I would describe the macroeconomic risk factors going forward is that they apply to the entire business just like they apply to the customers that we had created in this quarter, and we don't see a big difference in the customer base that we created in the quarter and the average customer base. Sure. All right, well, I'm going to answer both of your questions. So video is a -- the secular trends for video haven't changed. What happened is that we've always said that we thought it was possible to grow video if our overall relationship growth was high enough because there still are a -- the ratio of video customers to overall customers, it is continuing to decline, but it's -- if you grow fast enough -- if you grow faster than that rate of decline, then you create video growth. And that's really what's happened here. Nothing has changed the secular trend, although there probably was a little less downgrading during the period because so many people were stuck in front of screens at home. But I don't think the overall trend has changed. What really just happened is we accelerated our growth rate overall in customer relationships. And as a result of that -- and the shift in share, some of the video -- we grew faster than the rate of video decline, and it's that simple. In the past, we said we thought that we're -- that satellite would decline and that we could grow fast enough to have small video growth. Overall, growth declined faster than I thought it would over the last several years, but it's still -- I would say that, that trend has not changed. All that changed was we grew our overall relationships faster. And with regard to me, I intend to continue to be here, and the Board would like me to stay. Yes. I wasn't saying that we were changing our profile investment strategy. I was merely commenting that we've been investing in capacity upgrades, and those capacity upgrades have served us well, and they serve the whole communications infrastructure of the country well. And you have a very competitive facilities-based market in the United States, and it results in very high-quality products, and it will result in future high-quality products. Well, to your implication, yes, if we could find ways to segment promotional activity that will result in faster growth, we will take advantage of those opportunities. And one of the reasons we were able to be successful with the promotion that we just did was our ability to not only do the promotion but to execute it and to actually install it in a very short order of time in a way that was convenient for customers using self-installation. And so yes, there's continued opportunity for acceleration. But that was a particularly successful result. And we will continue to explore opportunities going forward to accelerate growth from a marketing perspective, but we feel pretty good about our ability to continually grow and to continually -- and to -- and accelerate that growth, and nothing that has happened to date has dissuaded us from that perspective. It was not the majority of our sales by any means. It was a nice -- and it fit the moment. Oh, I think no. The way we look at the mobile growth opportunity, it's really a function of activity levels and how often we get a chance to communicate with our customers about mobile and what the rate of that attach rate is. And that continues to improve. And it's a relatively new business for us, and we are continuing to improve our tactics at that business and we're continuing to get improvement every week in terms of our results. And so we have high expectations for continued growth in that area. Yes. It was -- sort of in broad terms, yes, we want to continue to take advantage of the technological opportunity that the network provides us and the cost-efficient way to upgrade the network on a relative basis to what we think our competitors can do. And so to the extent that demand exists for new products or that demand can be created for new products and drive revenue associated with those new products, we want to upgrade our network to take advantage of that. And at the moment, we have a lot of capacity. And so I don't see, at the moment, our profile changing. But as a general notion, we think that with relatively efficient capital investments, we can continue to upgrade our network through time. And 10G is a reflection and a description of that opportunity. It's a cost-efficient upgrade platform that allows us to get to very high capacity, low latency on a relative basis more efficiently than anyone else. Well, we're in a quiet period with regard to RDOF, Craig, but -- and also, our 2% passings growth rate includes new construction as well, meaning new home creation. And the bulk of that is that at this point in time. So... It's good returns on investment capital spending over time. And it's -- the activity levels in the second quarter were similar to what they were planned for and what they were in the first quarter. So construction didn't actually slow down. And I'm talking about new home construction in the quarter. We're rapidly approaching. So Bryan, when we did the agreement with the FCC, it had -- it was a 7-year agreement. So those provisions go away automatically in 7 years, but there was a caveat in our agreement that allowed us to terminate it after 5 years if the marketplace indicated that those conditions were no longer relevant. And I would just describe our goal there as housekeeping, and -- because it's -- because the market didn't require those conditions and in my view never did, we wanted to get -- we wanted to put ourselves from an opportunity perspective on the same even playing field as all of our competitors. But we don't have any change in business strategy or marketing strategy or product strategy as a result of that request. Okay. The last question, it's delayed decision-making. There's opportunity there... In creating new products and services for enterprise that -- and enterprise will use their telecommunications infrastructure in a different way, potentially going forward. So I think in the long run, there's more opportunity. The question on the thought process around programming and whether or not the whole sort of ecosystem argues for a more aggressive stance or not, I think, is the implication of your question. I think that's coming. And at some point, somebody oversteps the bounds of reason and there'll be some sort of breakage that will occur. Yes. And Chris used -- sorry, Chris said that our SMB continues to accelerate over last year. And that's not just a function that businesses are back and working, but it's also a share shift function. And we're underpenetrated in SMB, and so our upside there is bigger than it is in residential from a market share perspective and we have the best products. The answer is yes. Yes, we have a range of video products, including a traditional bundle. And to some extent, in the long run, the skinny packages have limits in terms of what we can penetrate with because of the way the contract language works, our programming deals and the minimums that are required in the -- the minimum distribution required in a big bundle. So there's a challenge for us in balancing all of that that so far we've been successful in dealing with. But the answer is yes, and the challenges in video have not gone away. You mean -- I'm not sure I fully understand your question. But you mean are we willing to do additional packaging? Oh, Yes. Yes, absolutely. And I think you'll see us selling more and more packages of OTT product that we don't necessarily own but more on a consignment basis or on a -- potentially even a packaging basis."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Now turning to customer results on Slide 5 of our presentation. Including the impact of COVID-19-related customer offers and retention programs, we grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.8 million over the last 12 months or by 6.3% and by 755,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 850,000 in the quarter and by over 2.1 million or 8.3% over the last 12 months. Video grew by 94,000 in the quarter, better than last year's second quarter decline of 141,000 video customers. The positive performance was driven by churn benefits at a time when consumer demand was high as well as the pull-through effect of our COVID programs. Wireline voice grew by 45,000, also benefiting from the same likely temporary factors as video. Mobile net adds accelerated again to 325,000. Beginning in mid-March, we introduced 3 COVID-19-related offers and programs for our customers. Each of these offers ended on June 30. As we did in our first quarter materials, we had provided an addendum showing the customer counts for each of these 3 COVID-related offers as of the end of the second quarter. The first was our Remote Education Offer, which provided 60 days of free Internet for new Internet customers with students or educators in the household. Over 90% of these customers are on our flagship speed tier or higher. This channel looked very much like traditional acquisition with nearly 50% having subscribed to and paid for additional products along the way. At the end of the first quarter, we reported 119,000 internet customers in the offer, which rolled off either as paying customers or disconnects during Q2. For Q2, net of some small in-quarter roll-off churn, we added 329,000 more Internet customers to the 60-day free program, with 160,000 remaining on the free offer at the end of Q2. And by July 27, 90% of the cumulative connects on this program from Q1 all the way through Q2 remained as either paying customers or still on the free offer within the 60 days. The second offer or customer category in the addendum reflects customers who participated in our Keep Americans Connected Pledge to the FCC. These are customers who indicated their inability to pay for service for COVID-19-related reasons. This program protected, as Tom mentioned, approximately 700,000 residential and SMB customers from collections and disconnect activity through June 30. 60% of these customers were -- continued to pay something, half of which were paid in full. And at the peak, there were over 200,000 who would have been disconnected under our normal collection practices. In an effort to assist COVID-19-impacted customers with overdue balances, we waived $85 million of receivables, which was recorded as a reduction of revenue in the second quarter. As a result, these customers no longer have an overdue balance. We believe that we'll retain most as long-term customers, but some of the over 200,000 may become disproportionately delinquent compared to a typical customer with disconnection in late Q3 or more likely in Q4 under our normal disconnect practices. Early payment trends on this base is, however, very good. The final category of customers we've isolated in our addendum are SMB and enterprise customers who requested a seasonal suspension of service or temporary downgrade of a line of service while their operations were closed or diminished. I don't expect there will be anything to report as an addendum in Q3 given these programs have effectively wrapped up. So how do we think about customer relationship performance in 2020 given COVID-19 in our various programs? Well, in the beginning of Q1, our customer relationship growth was accelerating, and our pre-COVID expectation was that would continue throughout 2020. In March and the second quarter, we absorbed a tremendous amount of new connection and service volume, providing free service and credits. Our goal was to do our part in helping customers in our local communities through a difficult economic period. As of the third quarter, we have a lot of customers who now have high-quality, attractively priced connectivity services from us. And our third quarter and fourth quarter performance will largely be a function of the economy, unemployment and any additional stimulus packages. It is clear to us that the actions we took to connect and protect customers during the crisis will result in long-term benefits for Charter, better-ending relationships in 2020, and we expect a higher customer growth rate this year compared to last. So our success in the second half of 2020 will be measured on third and fourth quarter year-to-date for last 12 months' net additions comparisons, not a particular quarterly comparison, which is consistent with how we manage the business. Turning to the financials. As we expected, there were a lot of moving parts in the quarter. I'll be referencing various COVID-related items, which we've laid out on Slide 9 of today's presentation. Residential revenue grew by 4.1% in the quarter primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth and similar PSU bundle and video mix trends we have seen over several quarters. This growth rate includes the negative impact of $76 million of onetime write-down for residential customers in the Keep Americans Connected program. SMB revenue grew by 2% given slower customer growth and $17 million of write-downs and credits for customers in the Keep Americans Connected and the COVID-related seasonal plan. That created some temporary ARPU pressure. So far, we've been pleased with our SMB performance. And while things can definitely change if local economies shut back down, early third quarter SMB sales and net addition performance has actually been better year-over-year. Spectrum Enterprise revenue declined by 7.1% year-over-year driven by the sale of NaviSite and the continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. Excluding both NaviSite and cell tower backhaul, Enterprise grew by 2.2%. That includes $18 million in onetime credits, which we extended to certain customers in return for contract extensions. While the comparability for NaviSite goes away after Q3, wholesale, in particular cell tower backhaul, continues to be challenged. Retail Enterprise, when excluding the $18 million of onetime bill credits, is growing revenue around 7%, but sustaining that growth or accelerating will be difficult until our customers are back to normal operations. We also have some exposure to the hotel segment, which we've tried to deal with in the second quarter. Spectrum Reach second quarter advertising revenue declined by 37% driven by the COVID pandemic, which reduced core ad sales growth. In April, sales were about 50% of prior year. May was about 60% of the prior year. And June was about 70% of prior year. So the trend has been improving, but our core won't be fully back to normal until later in the year or early next year. Of course, we will benefit from political along the way, which will help the prior year comparison. Mobile revenue totaled $310 million with $158 million of that being device revenue. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 3.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expense. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $45 million or 0.6% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses, excluding mobile, declined by 1.3% year-over-year or 0.8%, excluding NaviSite. Programming increased 1.6% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we've seen in prior quarters. We did not accrue any RSN fee savings in our programming expenses in the second quarter as the certainty, amount and timing of any credits is not yet clear. If and when any COVID rebate for lost games occurs, we will pass that along to our video customers with no or minimal expected EBITDA impact. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by 18.3% year-over-year primarily driven by a $125 million benefit from the timing of sports rights payments for our Dodgers and Lakers RSNs, which have been pushed out to the second half and later depending on the sport and adjusted season. Costs to service customers increased by 4.6% year-over-year with meaningful productivity compared to 6.3% customer relationship growth. The higher level of expense growth was driven by record levels of transaction volume ranging from acquisition, upgrades, billing and service. And that expense includes roughly $44 million for recently accelerated hourly wage increases and COVID-19 benefits, which Tom mentioned, partially offset by lower medical costs and a onetime payroll tax credit. Bad debt expense was essentially flat year-over-year but some $48 million lower than what we would have expected based on higher customer counts and the unemployment rate. This quarter, bad debt benefited from the significant revenue write-off for customers who were in the protection program and generally better payment trends due to the stimulus package under the CARES Act. Bad debt going forward will be a function of the economy and any new stimulus package. Excluding bad debt variability, costs to service customers should continue to grow at a slower rate than customer relationship growth due to lower transaction volume and higher self-service trends despite the step-up in minimum wages and COVID flextime. Cable marketing expenses declined by 6.3% year-over-year given better media placement rates and a onetime payroll tax credit. Other expense declined by 6.6% year-over-year primarily due to lower advertising sales cost, costs related to NaviSite, which was sold, travel and insurance costs. Mobile expenses totaled $413 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage cost and operating expenses. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 7.3% in the quarter when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $103 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 6.7%, including a 2.7% negative growth rate impact from advertising revenue, net of its associated expense in both periods. We generated $766 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, and capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter. Our second quarter capital expenditure shows we continued to invest through the second quarter despite a disruptive environment. We invested significantly in continued capacity upgrades at the national and local levels to stay ahead of contention, and we didn't slow down on new build, including construction in rural areas. Obviously, the level of broadband installations drove much higher modem and router purchases and self-installation kits. We expect 2020 cable capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year, and the underspend relative to our original plan that I mentioned last quarter may not be as significant as a result of the now much higher growth rates. We generated close to $1.9 billion in consolidated free cash flow in the quarter. And excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $2.1 billion of cable free cash, up about $700 million versus last year's second quarter. We finished the quarter with $2.1 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. And as of the end of the second quarter, our net debt-to-last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.3x or 4.2x if you look at cable only. So we delevered a bit in Q2. Earlier this month, we issued $3 billion of long-dated, high-yield debt at very attractive rates. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our current run rate annualized cash interest is $3.8 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1.2 billion at an average price of $499 per share. We completed a lower amount of buybacks in Q2 than we did in Q1 as we wanted to survey both defensive and offensive opportunities in a unique climate. Our visibility to various scenarios surrounding COVID-19 has obviously improved. We will always evaluate the best use of our capital to generate long-term return for shareholders be it organic investments, such as the launch of our mobile or network edge-outs, purchasing someone else's shares or our own and probably in that order in terms of preference. And we remain comfortable in the middle or high end of our target leverage range. As I mentioned last quarter, we know that we have a high-quality, resilient asset with dedicated employees across our local communities, and we've invested significantly in our network and our people over the years. We also know there's a high demand for our product across every part of our footprint in both homes and businesses in good times and in bad, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network is well invested, ready and working for future opportunities. As the environment continues to evolve across the 41 states where we operate, our goal is to stay focused on what we do well and execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees across various economic and regulatory climates to create shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Why don't I start with the last one first? We're in a quiet period as it relates to the RDOF, and so we won't be commenting any further than what we've already said in the 8-K. The first one, and I'll give a shot at it here and then Tom may want to chime in as well, is the programs that we had in place have wrapped up as of June 30. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the customers that we created through the end of the first quarter and the second quarter on the Remote Education Offer, so all those net -- all those gross additions that came through, 90% of them are still with us, and the vast majority of them are paying and 50% of whom altogether had actually taken additional products from us and were paying along the way. So I don't have a crystal ball. But so far, they look every bit as good as regular-way acquisitions. They're not a low-tier package from us. Over 90% of them are in the flagship product. And then while there's risk attached to any of that because of the programs we've put, so far we don't see it. We're just putting it out there that we're watching it and so far it looks very good on the Remote Education Offer. Yes. And then the other program was Keep Americans Connected. At the peak, we had 200,000 customers who had gone beyond the point where we normally would have disconnected the customer. We've written off the balance for anybody who had an extended balance. So that was the $85 million that I mentioned. So by the time we got to July, all of those customers were in good standing partly because some of them had been paying along the way and partly because we wrote off. Now those that were written off revenue, as we sit here today, and we looked at those that cycled through the June billing cycle, they're paying and they're paying at a very good rate. And so if we had to sit here today, we'd say it looks very much like regular customer and customer churn. The caveat that we've put out there is obviously, there's a fair amount of stimulus that's been in -- a federal economic stimulus that's been in the environment, and we don't know what that's going to look like. We don't know how COVID is going to continue to develop. And nonpay will develop going forward, as it normally would with how the economy goes and how stimulus goes along with it. The final question that you asked, Jonathan, was do we see any more revenue write-off or exceptional bad debt later this year. No, none attached to any of these programs. To the extent that what we just talked about if the economy is difficult and there isn't stimulus, would we expect a higher nonpay rate in that environment which would result in bad debt? Yes, but that would be the same for any business. And that'd be the same for us in any environment where you have the economy which is more difficult. And thanks, Doug. So there's really -- since Tom and I both have been here, there's no change in our prioritization of cash flow. We've always said the most attractive way to deploy your excess free cash flow is to invest in further growth opportunities inside the business. The second would be to acquire other companies which have a better rate of return than buying back your own stock. And the third would be to buy back your own stock. And the reason for that order is because it's -- if you can get the first 2 that I mentioned going, it actually enhances the quality and the return of the buybacks that you do, too. Our views on that haven't changed, so I was just reiterating that's how we think about it. And I don't think in Tom's comments we were trying to foreshadow any type of major capital increase. We just said that our philosophy has always been to invest in our networks. We've done so. It's -- you can see the benefit of having gotten in front of capacity needs well in advance and put us in a position to add this amount of subscribers. And there's no major change that we're signaling there other than we intend to continue to invest very, very well inside of our networks. And nothing to -- not to diminish our own prowess either, but if you think about the demographics of who has somebody in their household who can claim to be a student or claim to be an educator, it's a pretty broad segment of the population. It was just a very attractive offer that was out at a point in time where people needed it, and it was a good opportunity to create new... No. But it's still created a new market and drove additional share shift. I don't either. Ben, on your first question, the delayed Dodgers and Lakers costs from the first and the second quarter, they've been pushed out to varying degrees depending on the RSN and the sport and the adjusted season. But the biggest driver for the first half of this year is the P&L recognition of the Dodgers where we've paid the cash, but the expense for unplayed games will be amortized over the remaining life of the contract. So it's unlikely there'll be a large catch-up in the back half of this year. Now to the extent that there are programming rebates, those are very complex. And in most cases, we're not going to know for some time if we'll receive any rebates or credits back from the leagues. The same applies to programming networks on the programming cost side. But what we have said is to the extent that we do receive any rebates or credits for canceled games or programming -- on the programming expense line, so between rights and programming extra cost due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we'll pass those along to the customers. So I don't see a material EBITDA impact, although it could put an offsetting revenue credit and expense credit to the extent it materializes. And maybe just to add on to it, those are -- homes passed are including what you count as marketable. So the extent that you're picking up additional homes maybe without even construction, we're building about 500,000, 600,000 a year. And so that's what you should think about as being added from a construction standpoint. It's not a material driver to our overall net adds inside of the quarter, and it hasn't been -- but as it builds up over time, it's obviously a cumulative effect as you start to penetrate those vintages of construction. But what we've done over the past year hasn't been a big driver for our broadband net add growth. But if you do enough of it over a prolonged period of time, it's snowballs. Craig, the profitability of wireless, our views on it hasn't changed. We're not dependent on any additional offload above and beyond the WiFi that we already utilize. And even under that rather limited model, our expectation continues to be that our breakeven, if you had no additional subscriber acquisition, so no marketing and sales cost, no cost of provisioning new customers, that the break-even point would be around 2 million lines. That's a bit of a fictitious or academic scenario because we're always going to be selling it, we're always going to be marketing. But that gives you a sense of where the business, absent growth, would break even. Which we're rapidly approaching. So the economics of wireless are good. But like any start-up subscription business, it costs money to get going and you acquire customers, and they have a positive payback on every single one of them that we acquire. And so our views on the profitability hasn't changed. To the extent that we're able to improve the economics along the way, which we've talked about extensively in the past, that would make that even better, but we don't rely a ton on that. And Bryan, on the working capital, if you think about the past 2 years, meaning 2018 and 2019, there were some pretty unique items that were taking place, whether it was the wind down of all-digital or last year we hinted a -- the big billing standardization project, which -- both of which had impacts on working capital. We haven't had anything like that. That's been abnormal this year. We do have large springs inside the quarter due to seasonality. You saw that inside of Q2 where we had a positive contribution to working capital. Last year, we had a negative one that was driven by that billing standardization which we talked about then. To give you an order of magnitude, there are days when we collect $300 million of cash in 1 day of collections. And so it's going to move around a little bit both inside of a quarter and for a full year based on the timing of your programming payments, the timing of your collections. And so I don't want to hoist ourselves here on our own petard and give a working capital forecast other than to say there's no major change this year that could cause us -- should cause us to be abnormal. And whether it's positive or negative by a few hundred million, it's not going to be a material driver to our free cash flow this year is my current expectation. Yes. People in large enterprise, they're not in the office. And to the extent their IT people are, it hasn't been the time where they're most aggressively looking to save money and change providers and move to Spectrum. We're still making a fair amount of sales, and it's picking up every month, just getting back to a more normalized environment. But it's been depressed, and it's going to be probably until businesses -- enterprise businesses get back to normal operations. Maybe I'll take... Yes, there is. Yes. You had also asked about the difference between at-risk customers for nonpay as it relates to residential and SMB. On the residential side, we -- as I mentioned, we have a product that's in high demand, that's highly competitive. It's attractively priced. It's attractively packaged. And because of the way that we do all of that and operate, we don't -- there's going to be high demand for it. It's just a question of people's ability to pay. And there's some uncertainty around where does the economy go. And even if the economy is bad in an environment where you have a significant amount of stimulus, we tend to get paid very quickly in that environment because of the value of the product that we provide. So that's really how we think about the residential environment, is the economy and the level of stimulus. SMB, it's really a question of whether they're open for business or not and how -- if they're not open for business, how long can they sustain from their own liquidity perspective of not being in business. And that's the uncertainty that we face on that front. Otherwise, the quality of our products and our ability to go gain market share in an environment where people are looking for faster products at better prices, you would argue that -- if the share flow could actually increase in the SMB space for us along the way. I'm trying to remember which because I gave a lot of percentages today. So I gave the... No. That was residential in SMB. But the vast, vast majority of those unit -- if you take a look at the addendum we provided, the vast majority of those customers were in the residential space, and so it's heavily weighted towards residential. But it was both. It was both. And so 60% of customers have been making some payment, including partial payments, half of which -- or about 30% of the total base had been making full payment, and that included -- those stats included both residential and SMB. Thanks, Tim. Thank you, everyone."

And after the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter's first quarter 2020 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. On today's call we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO, and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. First, on behalf of all of us at Charter, let me express our concerns for those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in our local communities we serve, as we endure together an extremely serious health, social and economic crisis. The hard work and dedication of Charter\u2019s 95,000 employees has been remarkable. We're all proud of how we're serving our customers at this time. Charter's employees are in trucks, in the field, call centers, dispatch network operation centers, their homes, and retail stores, where we provide customer equipment and numerous support functions that enable our company to service our customers. We remain focused on our customers and communities and we've been able to deliver our connectivity services without interruption to our customers across the country. We know our role as a provider of communication services and the importance of keeping connectivity services fully functioning for both new and existing households and businesses, which enable social distancing, including remote working, distance learning, telehealth services and family communications. In mid-March as part of our effort to keep America connected during this crisis, we pledged to do a number of things. We committed to offer Spectrum Internet for free for 60 days to households with students or educators, who do not already have a Spectrum Internet subscription. We recently announced that we are extending the availability of this offering through June 30. As of March 31, we added approximately 120,000 customers connected under this offer, with many more installed in April. By the end of the school year, we expect that this offer will have helped approximately 400,000 students and teachers, and their families continue schooling through remote learning. For 60 days, we also committed to suspend collection activities, not terminate service for residential or small or medium business customers, who are experiencing COVID-19 related economic challenges. We also extended the availability of this offer to June 30. Additionally, we've opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use and we've prioritized over 1,000 requests from government, healthcare and educational institutions for new fiber connections, bandwidth upgrades and new services, that includes major hospital groups and the two U.S. Naval hospitals in New York and Los Angeles. And Spectrum News has opened its websites to ensure people have access to high quality local news and information. We've also donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our whole footprint of 16 million video subscribers. Charter provides essential service, and we've been working to keep America connected working and learning, while at the same time, protecting our employees. We've instituted guidelines in our call centers that enhance social distancing between employees, including enabling a significant percentage of those employees for remote work. We've also altered our field operations protocol, by aggressively moving to customer self-installation. So while we continue to operate at nearly full capability, we're taking the necessary precautions to promote the safety of our employees. We're also providing our employees with outstanding benefits. We've implemented an additional two weeks of paid sick time for COVID related illnesses, for when we ask an employee to self-quarantine. We've given every employee an additional 15 days of COVID-19 related flex time to address other COVID related issues, including caring for children and dependents. In early April, we increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by a $1.50 per hour back to February. We also committed to raising our minimum wage for hourly workers to at least $20 an hour over the next two years. We are paying employees in parts of our business like residential and SMB direct sales, whose work has been put on hold, and to reinforce our commitment to employees we announced that for 60 days no employee will be laid off or furloughed. We have a great business with employees committed to our mission and that will ensure that we are able to excel through the eventual economic recovery. We continue to perform well operationally, both through the end of the Q1 and now. In first quarter, we added 580,000 residential and SMB Internet customers. We had a good quarter, driven by demand for our higher quality products. We also saw an increase in the number of residential and business customers, upgrading their speed. Our ability to provision the outsized demand we saw in the quarter, has been a result of the investments that we have made over the last several years in our insourced and onshore high quality workforce, significant systems integration and automation, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms and our self-installation program. In fact, we accelerated the expansion of our customer self-installation from 55% of sales at the beginning of the quarter to nearly 70% at the end of the quarter to over 90% today. Data usage and traffic on our network also grew significantly during the quarter. In March Residential data usage for Internet-only customers was over 600 gigabytes per month, up over 20% since the fourth quarter. Our customers are benefiting from a continually decreasing price per gigabit. Peak traffic levels remain well below maximum capability. Our network as well as those of other cable operators in the U.S. and performed better than networks in other countries, because of the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our plan, like the recent rollout of 1 gig everywhere. The pro investment regulatory climate has made this possible. Over the coming years, we will invest in our network, as we built the lower density in rural communities and pursue our 10G plan, which provides a cost-efficient pathway for us to offer multi-gigabit speeds, lower latency, high compute services to consumers and businesses customers. With our inside-out strategy, we will continue to use and develop small wireless cells, powered by our network, together with our MVNO to connect customers in and beyond the home, delivering our throughput and economics for customers in fixed, nomadic and mobile environments. Our strategy will be enhanced by the FCC recently freeing up 1,200 megahertz of 6 gigahertz spectrum for WiFi. The FCC's action is a transformational step toward broadband in America. It was a bold move and we look forward to making significant use of the spectrum. Moving back to Q1 results, we also performed well from a financial perspective during the quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 8.4% and combined with our lower cable capital expenditures, our first quarter free cash flow grew by over 100% year-over-year. As we look forward, we would expect that demand for our residential broadband product will remain strong as people work and learn from home and need to stay connected. Broadly speaking, the health of our residential business will be impacted by what happens to unemployment and income and how long and the impact that such factors will have on customers' ability to pay for service in the coming months, including government support to consumers. Slowing household formation may also play a role and our ability to drive new customer growth, by slowing activity for both new sales and also churn. We also recognize that the recent strength in video and wireline voice trends maybe temporary due to lockdowns and reverse in an economic downturn. So our SMB business is more difficult. We serve approximately 2 million SMB customers and many of those customers are currently closed at least temporarily. As a result, SMB customer growth and revenue growth will be lower than our previous expectations. It will likely take time for this part of our business to recover, but it will and maybe with a faster growth rate than before the crisis. I expect our enterprise business to remain more stable than SMB. Enterprise customers are larger and most but not all will be able to stand the recession more than smaller businesses that have less liquidity. But our expectations for enterprise customers and revenue growth have also been tempered, as enterprise customers with complex products are less likely to switch and grant installation access in this environment. Our advertising business is inherently local and primarily supported by small and medium businesses, which have been hurt in the crisis, but we still expect political advertising to be meaningful, which will help us, particularly in the back half of the year. So clearly our revenue growth rate will be less than what we anticipated. But as service transactions and sales slow for the market as a whole, and customer adoption of self-service accelerates, there are a number of operating cost improvements and capital expenditure delays that will help cash flow growth now and in the future. We also believe that on a relative basis, we're in a far better position than most companies, as the value and demand for our service is significant and we're operating efficiently in serving our communities well, as we always have in a crisis. Chris will cover the potential impacts to our 2020 financials and reporting in more detail, but I want to be clear that, while we don't know the depth and duration of the impacts of social distancing, we pressure tested our business model, our liquidity and balance sheet through various scenarios. Our analysis confirms what we have always believed that we remain well positioned. Overall, we fully expect to be in good shape over the long term and we believe our business will continue to do very well, given the assets and products we have and the continued investment in those assets, our customers and our employees. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication and diligence through this crisis. They've been asked to go well above and beyond their regular duties and they've delivered, easing the strain for millions of families. The positive feedback we've received from our customers is very gratifying and we continue to treat our customers with respect, compassion and support and continue to deliver great products and services. We will come out strong around the other side of this crisis. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I am heartened by how we have risen to the challenge, and know that we will continue to deliver for our customers and for America, regardless of what comes our way. I'd also like to send my regards and best wishes to all of those listening to this call, may you and your families remain safe and healthy. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. Our first quarter results were strong and reflect where we were heading as a company before the COVID-19 crisis started here in the U.S. Our residential customer relationship net additions increased versus the prior year in each month of the first quarter, and we were driving increasingly efficient operations given our customer friendly operating strategy and growing our free cash flow quickly. Residential revenue grew by 4.2% in the quarter, primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth in similar PSU bundled and video mix trends we've been seeing over several quarters. SMB revenue grew by 5.4%. Enterprise revenue declined by 3.2% year-over-year, driven by the sale of Navisite and by continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. Excluding both cell tower backhaul and Navisite, enterprise grew by 6.9%. First quarter advertising revenue grew by 5.7% driven by political. In the month of March, non-political advertising revenue declined by 18.7% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID-19 related softness, including the abrupt postponement of sporting events. Mobile revenue totaled $258 million with $131 million of that being device revenue. In total consolidated first quarter revenue was up 4.8% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses in the first quarter; total operating expenses grew by $191 million or 2.7% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses excluding mobile grew by 1.1% year-over-year or 1.7%, excluding Navisite, that's despite faster relationship and revenue growth. Programming increased 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we've seen and talked about in prior quarters and we also had over $20 million of non-recurring programming benefits this quarter. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by 1.7% year-over-year, driven by lower regulatory fees and a $20 million benefit from the timing of sports rights payments. Cost of service customers increased by 1.4% year-over-year, compared to 4.5% customer relationship growth. That expense includes roughly $30 million for recently accelerated hourly wage increases and COVID-19 benefits, as well as $25 million of incremental estimated bad debt for COVID impacts as of March 31st. Excluding bad debt expense in both years, Q1 cost to service customers declined by 0.7%. We continue to meaningfully lower our per relationship service cost. Cable marketing expenses increased by 4.2% year-over-year, driven by higher labor cost and commissions. And mobile expenses totaled $374 million and they were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage cost and operating expenses. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 8.4% in the quarter, when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $116 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.1%. We generated $396 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter and capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion. We generated $1.4 billion of consolidated free cash flow, and excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $1.6 billion of cable free cash, up about $700 million versus last year's first quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million Charter shares and Charter Holding common units, totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $490 per share. Let me briefly turn to our customer results before addressing our business outlook in more detail. Including the impact of COVID-19 related customer offers and programs. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by close to 1.3 million over the last 12 months or by 4.5% and by 486,000 relationships in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 582,000 in the quarter, and by close to 1.6 million or 6.1% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 70,000 in the quarter, better than last year's first quarter decline of 145,000. In wireline, voice declined by 65,000, which was also better than last year's first quarter decline of 99,000. Through February, total customer relationships, internet and video net additions were all better year-over-year, and mobile net additions had continued to accelerate. By mid-March, due to increased social distancing practices and shelter-in-place orders throughout the country, demand increased significantly for our products, but we temporarily yielded less mobile, as sales call time focused on self-installation instructions and our mobile retail channel has been partially impacted. Also beginning in mid-March, we introduced three COVID-19 related offers and programs for our customers. In today's materials, we provided an addendum showing customer counts for each of these. I expect we'll continue to report this addendum for a couple of quarters to provide investors the transparency on the impact of our COVID-19 related offers and programs. The first of three offers available for customers is our 60 day free Internet offer for new Internet customers with students or educators in the household. We launched the offer in mid-March and it accounted for 119,000 of our 582,000 total Internet net additions in the quarter. At the end of March, we still had a large number of pending connects, in customers and the offer continue to grow at a fast pace in April. Interestingly, and uniquely, about 50% of the customers who participated in the offer in March chose to order additional products with immediate billing. The vast majority of these customers are taking our flagship Internet product at 200 megabits per second or 100 megabits per second, and a small minority subscribe to our low-income offer or our ultra and 1 gigabit premium offerings. The profile of these customers is very similar to the profile of our typical Internet customer acquisition stream, and while some of these customers will no longer subscribe to some of these services after 60 days, the payment trends for customers who took video and phone at the same time, already indicate to us that most of these customers will remain. The second offer of our customer category reflects customers under our 60 day keep Americans connected pledged to the FCC. These are customers who have indicated inability to pay for the service for COVID-19 related reasons. As of March 31, 140,000 residential customers were in this program, many who would have been in a collection cycle in normal circumstances, and only 1,000 of which had passed the point in the collection cycle, where we've -- normally disconnected their service at March 31. To give this some color, approximately 20% of the 140,000 customers today have balances which are fully current, and in total, nearly 50% have made partial or full payments entering into this protection program. However, approximately 65,000 of those customers now have past-due balances beyond the point of normal disconnections, meaning at the end of April. The number of customers requesting disconnection protection has continued to grow in April, and we expect it to grow further through the rest of Q2. We intend to work with these COVID-19 impacted customers to get them back in a good payment status, with the objective of fully continuing their service with us. The final category of customers we've isolated in our addendum, our SMB customers who have requested a seasonal suspension of service or temporary downgrade of a line of service, while their operations are closed or diminished. Certain restaurants, bars and hotels are good examples, where we've reduced service to a minimum level, and reduced the monthly bill, until these customers fully reopen. We also expect this category to grow in Q2. So what does all this mean beyond temporary ARPU dislocation and back-end subscriber risk? First, even if you exclude the impact of these offers and programs from our first quarter results, residential customer relationships and Internet grew at a faster pace year-over-year, that remains our long-term opportunity. Second, customers may move in, out or between these categories over time, as the economy contracts and ultimately expands. Our issue is not demand for our products, it will be our customers' ability to pay and how we help them in that respect over time. So, until we have a better sense for the depth and the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and its economic impact, it's difficult for us to project what the help we offer our customers will look like. However, we think we could end up creating more value over the long term, as we continue to treat our customers and our employees well. With that in mind, I'd like to expand on Tom's remarks as it relates to our business outlook and where we're likely to see pressure and opportunities over the coming months and quarters, depending how and when the economy reaccelerates. For our residential and mobile services, the quality and value of our products are clear and demand is high, with Internet up in March significantly, even without the COVID-19 related offers. And video and phone also saw positive net adds in March, at least temporarily. Looking forward, the risk of the household formation growth will be impacted. The other issue will be customers' ability to pay either via their wages or extended employment benefits under the Cares Act or other stimulus packages. And if, how and over what period of time, you can get some customers to repay back balances when they are able to make payments again. So there are all kinds of questions here, about financial presentation, accounts receivables revenue recognition, bad debt provision, and write-offs, which really reflected in Q2 and will work through in the coming months and quarters, and we intend to provide our investors transparency, as we go through our unique reporting exercise. When the economy begins to recover and assuming our customers can pay us, I expect our residential business will be in a good shape. SMB represented $3.9 billion of revenue for us last year or 8.5% of our total revenue. In the back half of March, we began to see softness in our SMB sales, where essentially our direct sales force has been on hold and that channel is a larger contributor to SMB sales than it is to residential. We estimate that less than 20% of our SMB customers are restaurants, hotels, bars, theaters and the like, many of which will struggle in this downturn. We are working with all of our SMB customers in this difficult time, and believe we can return to growth in an economic recovery. We expect to retail base for enterprise to be more stable. In March and April, we saw significant demand from healthcare and government segments to upgrade and add new services, which is taking the place of new connects and other areas. But we expect new sales to taper off in retail services growth in the short term, for enterprise will be moderated by customers' willingness to make changes, particularly for physical services in this climate. We will have an offsetting benefit in churn, but absent higher new sales, it will be difficult to grow retail enterprise significantly in the short term. For Spectrum Reach, our advertising group the second quarter will be challenging. March revenue was below our expectations by more than $30 million due to cancellations and the April variance was more than double that amount. We are proactively working with clients to move their advertising spend from sports events to reach their audiences in different places or to move out there orders generally. We believe there is an opportunity to both recover and earn more advertising business, once the economy picks back up. We still expect significant political spend in the back half of this year, so the full year impact won't be as dramatic on a year-over-year basis. Those are the short-term revenue challenges and the long-term opportunities, what are the potential offsets in our cost structure? Churn across all of our subscription services was already declining significantly before the crisis. Lower churn and voluntary churn is declining even more now, but new sales will also decline, all of which says that we expected much lower level of service calls, truck rolls, installations, commissions and labor-related activity, that applies to residential, SMB and enterprise. As Tom mentioned, self-installation is now over 90%, up from 55% in the first part of the first quarter, and with utilization of digital self-care up over 30%, our integration investments and our self-service platforms and portals are paying off. The current prices has accelerated customers' adoption curve for digital service, and we don't think it goes back to where it was. So outside of bad debt and some accelerated wage increases to our frontline, our cost of service will decrease with less activity. Employee turnover will decline and hiring activity is likely to slow across the business, which has direct cost and tenure benefits, and we think any remaining EBITDA shortfall relative to our plans would likely be offset by CapEx, that would be lower than previously expected, due to higher self-installation, lower churn, the timing of scalable infrastructure spend and potential construction delays. So that's how we believe the model will flex. What we don't know, is the depth and duration of a recession, but we like our business model, how we manage the business across various climates and we believe we can grow long-term. It's probably a good transition to the balance sheet and our liquidity profile. As Tom mentioned, we have done a lot of modeling to stress test our balance sheet under various economic scenarios. We finished the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. In early March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, we priced a long-dated high yield financing at an all-time low coupon, and on April 17, we issued $3 billion of our tightest coupons ever for 10-year and 30 year investment grade tranches. Pro forma for those investment grade bonds and recently called debt at March 31, we had $8.4 billion of total available liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.4 times or 4.3 times, if you look at cable only. In that respect we've already been deleveraging slightly. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our weighted average cost of debt is only 4.9% and the weighted average life of our debt is 12.2 years, with more than 90% of our debt maturing beyond 2022. We have a schedule on slide 13 of today's presentation, which puts our maturity profile in perspective relative to last year's cable EBITDA. Together with our significant liquidity and positive free cash flow, we remain in a very good position to finance our operations organically, as well as through the capital markets, which remain open to Charter. As it relates to our stock repurchases, we've been under a 10b5-1 plan which was entered into, right before the COVID-19 crisis began here in the U.S. Due to lower share prices in March, we purchased more the target volume in March than April. We have never provided guidance on buybacks, because we think it can encourage bad decision making relative to better alternative uses of cash over time. So we're going to be thoughtful and responsive to where we think the economy is going, our stock price, our liquidity and any organic or organic opportunities, inorganic opportunities which may arise. While the current environment does suggest caution in the short term, we are not modifying our 4 to 4.5 times leverage target range today and we'll continue to monitor the economic climate and the interest rate market and regularly evaluating our leverage target. We know that we have a high quality resilient asset with dedicated employees across our local communities and we've invested significantly in our network and people over the years and there is high demand for our product across every part of our footprint, in both homes and businesses in good times and bad, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings, and ensure that our network is well invested, ready and working for future opportunities. Our goal is to stay focused on what we do well, and execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees across various economic and regulatory climate, to create shareholder value over the long term. Operator, we're now ready for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. I wanted to sort of take a bigger picture question for a moment, just given the strength of your results and the enviable position that you find yourself in of having a business that is relatively resilient in this kind of a market, what are the things that you can do, that sort of take advantage of the dislocation, whether it's more edge-outs, potentially acquisitions, a faster move in acquiring spectrum and trying to take some share in wireless, how do you think about using this dislocation as a way to make your business stronger, when we come out the other side of this disruption?\nTom Rutledge: Craig, obviously we think about that every day and we have some cash on hand to be opportunistic, if there is an opportunity that would require investment. But, the biggest opportunity we see, is to continue doing what we're doing and just doing it better and well and being able to execute better and well and continue to succeed in the marketplace. Our biggest opportunity as a company is to continue to create customer relationships, and we think that we have a great set of assets that we've put together and invested in properly and therefore, we have advantages in terms of the products that we can sell relative to others at the moment, and we have a high quality, high skilled workforce that's capable of generating and operating activity, and that's our biggest direct upside, and we think we could continue to operate well and execute well going forward and to the extent that we're better at that than others, we create more value, more quickly.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you, that's helpful. If I could just ask another, maybe slightly more prosaic question just given all the attention being paid to sports right now, can you just talk about the way you'd like to see the issue of sports payments to RSNs and national sports networks work out and the pressure to rebate to customers and that sort of thing?\nTom Rutledge: Yes. Well look, I mean we've talked for years about the reality of programming costs and how sports drives the bulk of the programming cost. If you look at our average cost of programming per customer in the high $60 range on average, that's the wholesale cost that we're planning for customer. My guess is that, if sports was not involved in the negotiations for the creation of that cost, that it would be less than half of what it is. So sports is the major driver in the cost of content, and obviously it makes the whole product difficult to sell because of the cost that consumers have to pay and the effect of -- I mean just simply, it's a very expensive product and people have a hard time paying for it. The reality is that, we would love to pass through the sports programming costs back to the customer, if it isn't paid or the events don't occur. There is still a big question about whether the games are going to be playing, and if they are played, most likely, the costs will not be rebated to the customers. So, I don't -- at this point in time, we have a structure in the industry in how we pay for content. It's all bundled together and tied together contractually and we have very little control over directly. So we'd love to see our customers relieved if they can be. Ultimately, it's the athletes who are getting the money and at some point, somebody has to give up their money and give it back to the customer and that hasn't happened yet.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks, Tom.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. James, we will take our next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. Tom, given that you obviously have exposure across the country, can you just talk about how the markets are different for areas like New York and California, where lockdown started early and compared to the other markets, are you sort of seeing any sort of green shoots, as some of these states start opening up and any sort of change in direction of business? And then just a simple question on the network, obviously, it's highly resilient right now, but I'm assuming that from the work-from-home orders right now that data transfer is becoming more symmetrical and your upstream on your network is not conducive for that kind of thing, I think. Can you sort of help us think about, is there any stress on the network from that side and what needs to be done, if any? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well in terms of variation by various parts of the country, obviously there are reopenings occurring and we're preparing to operate differently in different parts of the country, depending on what the local regulatory climate is with regard to what's allowed from a business practice perspective. As an essential business, we've been operating the whole time, and obviously we have to keep our business running. So we've been running it under the tightest conditions that exist in terms of what we can do and how we have to take care of our employees and how we have to take care of our customers. So as we begin to see places opening up, we are preparing to respond to the local markets individually and to project our capability locally. I can't tell you that I can see at this moment any differences from one location to another, in terms of -- New York City's a unique place, but it's unique in every way, always is, but broadly speaking, we've been locked down everywhere until now and...\nChris Winfrey: We are growing market share everywhere.\nTom Rutledge: We are growing consistently everywhere. Now in terms of the future of the network and the load on it, we've been able to handle the very quick change in demand and one interesting thing about -- the demand has gone up a lot in terms of network utilization, but it's also spread out. You build your network to maximum peak utilization and not total utilization. So it's the Mother's Day call effect from a network build perspective. You build for the one day a year, when you need every bit of your network. And the network has been built and it's absorbed what we think of, as a year's worth of augmentation in a few weeks. But the general trend that we now see in a few weeks, has been going on for quite a long time, and we expect it to continue. And so we have a pathway in terms of our assets to developing what we think the future communications is, including an upstream capability, as upstream utilization continues to grow. So that's what we call 10G, it's also called DOCSIS 4.0, in terms of the way we describe it from a specifications perspective. But we are still rapidly moving down the path of augmenting our networks in smart ways and capital efficient ways to continue to allow capacity to grow and to create new products that are hard to even envision, and we think that we're very well positioned to do that over the long term, it's going to require continued investment, but a proportional investment that's significantly less than any sort of brand-new build. So we think we're in a great position to make those investments and to realize the benefits of them, and to create the new products that are going to come from the. But we don't have an immediate upstream problem and we don't have a downstream problem, we have opportunities in both places in the long run.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Vijay. James, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim Partners. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMike McCormack: Hey guys, thanks. Tom, maybe just a quick question on Spectrum. I know you mentioned the FCC's move recently. Does that change your appetite in any way for the CBRS spectrum auction later this year? And then thinking about sports rights, I know you touched on it briefly, but what are your thoughts, just more generally, on the value of sports rights coming out of all this? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well, in terms of the -- good -- I understand your question, are you saying that the FCC's 6 gigahertz WiFi Spectrum affect our valuation of CBRS? The answer is no. They're really separate notions. I look at the 6 gigahertz spectrum as inside-house type spectrum; so all of our products are delivered wirelessly. So the real issue is mobility versus stationary or sedentary behavior, and the 6 gigahertz spectrum is really for in-house, high capacity use for a whole new set of products that will come along. The CBRS spectrum really allows for a more efficient use of the mobile platform, at least the way we look at it. Although it could be used indoors as well and it could be used indoors, both for mobile service and enterprise environments and externally and so we see them as separate notions and separate values and it hasn't affected -- one hasn't affected the other, in our view. Regarding sports rights, everybody misses sports and it really -- it obviously is an extremely valuable product and it is the glue that holds the bundle together, and you know, assuming that sports come back and that leagues generally play, the secular trends that are going on shouldn't change, in my view, the same forces will exist going forward that existed before the crisis. So absent a complete collapse of the sports business, I don't see a major change.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Mike. We will take our next question, James, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. I was curious if you could frame some of the scenarios that you were running for your SMB customers and trying to think through the exposure and how you frame the bad debt reserves in the quarter? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Sure.\nTom Rutledge: Yes, go ahead.\nChris Winfrey: Mike, on the SMB; I mean, I'd just put it a little bit in perspective, it's 8.5% of our revenue and so you can get to some pretty wicked scenarios and it's still doesn't have that material of an impact to the company. Certainly, when you're talking about liquidity our balance sheet perspective. It has an impact on the revenue growth rate for the entire company and so I think, given some of the stats that I was providing inside the prepared remarks, the idea was that people can take your own view of how bad, in particular, that segment of bars, restaurants and theaters could be hit and for how long and that will give you some sensitivity of what the trough looks like. We are not anymore than anybody else in terms of the depth and duration of the recession, but that's why we wanted to give some of those starts to give a framework for you think about it. The second question was -- first one was SMB, the second was?\nMichael Rollins: How you are seeing the bad debt.\nChris Winfrey: Well, every company has had to modify to new GAAP standard, which requires you to estimate your bad debt reserves for the receivables that you have at a period of time, as opposed to when they age. And so you've heard everybody talk about that this quarter. We're no different. We had in total between cable mobile, about $30 million of additional bad debt as an estimate for what might not be payable on the accounts receivables that existed at the time of close. In Q2, let me start maybe back with the first objective. Our goal through all of this, is A, to do well by the customer, by providing good offers for remote education, as well as for in this case, keep America connected pledge. But our goal is also not going to be to quickly get into a collection environment and cut them off. Our goal is going to be to keep these customers. And in the second quarter, to the extent that we work with the customer to right-size their receivable, some of that could impact the revenue recognition inside of Q2, and some of that for a financed a portion that they may need to pay back over time, could impact our estimate for bad debt reserve. That will apply for residential and SMB. And so, when I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to have a lot of technical accounting and reporting issues to deal with in Q2, it's true, but we're going to be focused on not the accounting outcome or how Q2 is going to look, we're going to be focused on what's the right long-term outcome for the customers, and for the company and make sure that the accounting does what's appropriate on the back end. But I think will be a little bit of noise and we'll make sure that we disclosed any revenue impacts in any bad debt impacts in our Q2 reporting.\nTom Rutledge: So, that's kind of an accounting explanation. The way I look at bad debt is have you created customers and that you keep them and do they pay you? And if you create customers and they pay you, that's good and if you don't get a lot of bad debt. And, when I look at the customers that we're creating, we have -- they're taking our high quality products in the residential space and they, from a profile perspective, they look like the customers that we've always created, and so they're going to be affected by the macro climate, obviously, but we have products that we can sell to those customers that have value regardless of what -- where they fall in the income range, we sell to very poor people and we sell to very rich people and we have a product mix that can work across the entire marketplace. So, I'm confident that we can create valuable customer relationships through time. Even in the small business arena, we're still creating customers today, and even in -- if you think about the restaurant business which is closed, the vast majority of those customer relationships are still intact. They still want websites and they may have taken out businesses or whatever, but even if the business is closed, doesn't mean that they don't want to have a relationship with us.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Mike. James, we will take our next question.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Bernstein. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Hey, thank you. When you all analyze the improvements in churn, what are the drivers of that other than the all-digital upgrade that we've talked about at length and the in-sourcing of customer service? I wonder if your performance in the Legacy Charter territories continues to provide any helpful data to answer this question?\nTom Rutledge: What's good for churn? Look churn was before the impact of COVID, our churn was coming down steadily and we've all -- everything we've done post-COVID has been consistent with the strategies that we had before, in terms of having high quality service, high quality products, high quality workers, in-sourced in the United States, who are trained and capable of providing excellent service. If you do that, you have less activity, and the ultimate value proposition that drives the cost to serve is activity. I mean, if you can -- if your service is better and your products have longer lives, inherently, you have less activity per dollar of revenue generated, which means that you have a higher margin or lower cost to serve. And churn is one of the measurement of customer satisfaction. It's also a measure of mobility in the economy and other things of that nature, but all of those things being held constant, if your churn rate is going down, it means your customer satisfaction is going up, because your products are better and that's been our objective in terms of managing the company and still is. So the legacy Charter platform, churn was coming down and legacy Time Warner platform and legacy Bright House platform, churn was coming down across all of those businesses, and cost to serve was coming down too because of the self-installation models and all digital models in terms of digital type flows that we created, allow for ease from a consumer perspective of dealing with us and less friction than the actual transaction, because a point is necessary to keep for that process to occur, and all of that creates less activity and higher satisfaction, which is a very virtuous cycle in the sense that, if you have less activity and you have less failure in your activities, meaning you have less service calls, you will have less missed appointments, you actually create more satisfaction, which extends subscriber life even longer, which by itself, reduces activity. So that was the path we were on and it's still, I believe in the path we're on. It's a little bit confused by the volume that we're currently under. We've had an enormous uptick in activity in the last two months due to sales. And interestingly, we've created in the last 60 days, 10,000 new broadband customers a day, so 600,000 customers in 60 days. That's a lot of work and we've done that pretty seamlessly.\nPeter Supino: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Peter. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two quick ones, if I may. Tom for you, you mentioned that the importance of the sort of the secular trends in sports haven't changed. I'm wondering if you can touch on some of the secular trends in the business that you think have changed, how the business is going to look different when we come out of the current environment? And then, Chris, I think you said that non-programming costs were down year-over-year when you exclude the COVID impact from wages and bad debt, is that a trend that you would have expected to continue throughout the year, but for the impact of the pandemic? And then, should we annualize that $30 million and $25 million of COVID related impact or does it sort of flow differently as we go through the year? Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: So Jonathan, on secular change. I would say it this way, I don't know that they're permanently changed, but they are permanently advanced. Meaning, we took years of secular change and compressed it into a very short period of time, and we're not going to go back to the original trend line. We may have just moved way up the trend line. And I think network utilization is one of those, and I think customer self-serve is the other and the cost to serve, as a result of that. We were already fairly down -- far down the road in the customer self-service model, and we were fortunate when we got hit with what we did, and with the marketing tactics that we employed, that we were able to actually deal with it, because we had started the quarter in the 55% range, I think of self-installation and we were about at 70%, when everything changed, and we're over 90% now of self-installation. So the fact that we were already at 70%, allowed us to get to 90% with a fair degree of operational efficiency. And so we were prepared fortunately at that moment. But I think that's a big change in the business going forward and I think people using Zoom and other kinds of two-way communications in a work like environment in their homes is probably advanced by a number of years for the long term.\nChris Winfrey: And Jonathan, you -- go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: I was going to say, just a follow-up on that and this is probably directed at you Chris, going from 55% to 90%, what does that do for margins in a year or maybe two years when we get out of this environment? How much are margins structurally higher because of that?\nChris Winfrey: Yes, I don't want to get into a percentage margin discussion. But the cost of a self-installation is about a third of the cost of a professional install and the benefit of that ensures to both OpEx and CapEx, depending on what type of installation it is. So it's significant. But keep in mind that we were already at 55%, we would have been at 70% by the end of the quarter, absent the acceleration. Your second question was on non-programming expense. There is marketing, there is advertising expense, there's enterprise expenses in this, so I prefer to think about cost to service customers, which is really the residential and SMB cost to provide network operations, field operations and customer service operations to call centers and billing. Just the bulk of our costs. That cost, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, absent leaving side just bad debt was down year-over-year in gross dollars, and it was down as a per relationship basis. And I know I've cautioned in the past that what we're committed to is, that per relationship to cost to serve is going to continue to decline, and I've been hesitant to say that the dollar cost to serve, excluding bad that would also decline on a gross basis. Clearly, it would've inside of Q1 year-over-year and given that we do expect -- once we get beyond April, April has been a high activity month. We think that transaction -- sales transactions and move churn and all of the different service transactions will start to slow down. And so that could actually accelerate excluding bad debt, the cost to serve declines year-over-year, certainly on a per relationship basis. So, I think the trends there are good and they continue -- there is an increase in the amount of our labor expense, because we accelerated the path that Tom was already putting the company on, to a $20 minimum wage and that was $30 million in the quarter for really a month and a half of expense. So yes, that will get annualized at the appropriate rate. But I think that's a small dollar amount relative to the amount of transactions that come out of the business and I think our operating strategy fully funds that, and the acceleration of the adoption of self-service and self-install are very helpful and making that viable for not just our employees, but for all stakeholders.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. I just want to ask you both about two comments you made in the prepared remarks. Tom, you've been in the business for a long time and you've been through lots of cycles and I don't think I'm breaking news to say that the cable company historically has not had the best customer reputation and even reputation with sort of regulators and politicians. And you mentioned sort of the reputational benefits that the company is seeing, I'm just wondering if you have sort of conviction in that being sustainable or any real data behind that, because obviously that has not been the lens with which cable operators historically have been looked at? And then, Chris, you were talking about capital allocation and the buyback. You mentioned organic or inorganic opportunities. Just wondering, if you could just take a minute to remind us of kind of your M&A framework and sort of the kinds of things you guys historically have talked about either being interested in or not interested just so we can flesh out that comment a little bit more. If you're willing? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well, Ben, I -- and I've always loved the cable industry and what it does. And I've always thought that it has done great things consistently. As you think about the upsides of our reputation, we transform telecommunications and if you think -- I remember just 15 years ago, 20 years ago the average wireline phone bill was $75 in the New York area, today it's $9.99. And if you look at what the cost of broadband was, particularly on a per-gigabit basis, think about dial-up, AOL dial-up in the year 2001, when they acquired Time Warner, was $20 bucks a month, then you got 56K. The cost of broadband has gone way down and the telecommunications outputs of the investments that the cable industry has made have been tremendous in terms of the benefits that it's created for consumers. Nobody likes paying their cable bill and nobody likes paying for programming costs, and that's always been a difficult aspect of our business, since we've had competition in video, since the rise of satellite and the cable industry had to divest itself of programming essentially, because of the vertical integration rules. The programming cost have increased massively, because programming is a copyright, which is a legal monopoly and they've had pricing power over a competitive video business and consumers don't like that and -- but now you have the rise of a-la-carte direct-to-consumer programming in Netflix and Warner Home Media and Disney and so forth, and so a lot of our customers have the video they want to buy at prices they want to pay and so I think it's -- the biggest driver of negativity in the cable business I think has been the price of video, and to some extent that's breaking up. So I'm relatively optimistic about our status and I think that when you really look at it objectively, we have done great things and I think that the facilities based competition model that we have in the country has done a really great job of producing really high quality communication services consumers.\nChris Winfrey: Then on the M&A framework, on the inorganic side, I think the prospect is probably more actionable on the organic side, some of the things that Tom has also talked about in the past, but on the inorganic side would be M&A. Nothing has changed with the way that we think about opportunities we -- as Tom just mentioned, we love cable. At the right price we would do cable all day long and that means tack-ons, which means do frequently as we can, as well as bigger acquisitions. That hasn't been the case today. They are mostly family, controlled or family owned and so that will be not in our hands, that will be in the hands of others who decide that. We have looked all around to see if there's anything on the content side, we haven't found anything that really matches up well with our assets and capabilities. Other than some of the local news that we've expanded to organically and that makes a lot of sense for us, and particularly in this environment, it has been a big asset. We've thought a lot about wireless. I think in the assets that we have, the ability to deploy small cells, the attractive MVNO that we have, we haven't found a scenario that made a whole lot of sense for us or for the industry. There are cases that we can take a look at to accelerate growth, whether that's in enterprise or whether that's in wireless technology, where we've made some minority and some joint investments with Comcast. Same would apply to advertising, but none of those are going to be particularly material. They will be great for those segments of business and the ability to accelerate growth hopefully, but it's not going to be something that really materially shows up on the balance sheet and impacts our liquidity. All of which leads you back to and I think unless Tom has got something got something else he'd add, leads you back to -- we think the organic opportunities and if you can't buy somebody else's cable stock, buying more of your stock at some point in the future is probably between organic and that is where we have ended up in the meantime.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, both.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. James, will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. I was just wondering, if you could talk about maybe some of the new offers for customers? I think I saw something that you're doing with Sirius. Could you talk about any plans you have for Peacock? Do you need to wait for your NBCU renewal at the end of the year? And then finally In terms of customer offers does the AT&T promo offer for HBO impact the way you would sell or offer HBO?\nChris Winfrey: I had a hard time hearing. So the first question was any new offers including, I think the Sirius trial that we've run out in the marketplace was the question there. And then the second was Peacock, and whether that needs to -- that could happen now or needs to wait until the future renewal. And the third was the HBO Max, to the extent that it impacts the way that we sell the -- or package the HBO product.\nTom Rutledge: In terms of our offer strategy, I wouldn't disclose those before we do them. We experiment with various offers through time. But not to minimize our marketing prowess, but we -- ultimately it's -- do you have good products and are they worth that cost and that's what affects your ability to sell and succeed in the marketplace. But we experiment with the marketing tactics all the time, and Sirius is one of them, and so we don't have any announcements about future tactics that we might employ. In terms of Peacock, we have ongoing discussions with NBC and we haven't concluded anything yet. In terms of HBO Max, we just completed an agreement with AT&T, and we're going to convert our customers who have HBO to the new product and then we're going to market the new product as part of our overall video offering. And we look forward to doing that.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jessica. Operator, we'll take our last question please.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. I'll make it quick. First, I guess just two quick ones. First, Chris on the comment on the March advertising I guess \u2013 or April advertising I guess you said it's twice as \u2013 variance is twice what you saw in March. Is that \u2013 I mean that were down sort of 36% so far in April and any color you could give on what you think \u2013 how the quarter is going to shape up there? And then on the CapEx question, you said given the outbreak, it will likely come in lighter than you previously expected, which is already lower capital intensity. Any magnitude of change there and if you could give us any color on the buckets would be great too? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So the -- and the April comment that I made was really not related to the percentage decline year-over-year, it was really the variance to our, what would have been our expectation. So $30 million we had literally come off the books in March. It was already sold, came off the books. So over twice that, that came off the books for April. We think that will probably be the trough in April, small, start recovery in May and maybe depending on how they openings occur, June start to come back. So Q2 is going to be a rough advertising. It's not a big part of our business, but it's going to be a rough advertising quarter. We do think as things come back online, there'll be some pent-up demand for advertising on the core local, which for us has been growing, our core business has been growing at 3% to 4% year-over-year, on top of that there will be pent-up demand. So whenever the market opens back up and a lot of that tied to the health of SMBs and when the recession or when the distancing starts to open back up, Q2 will be the rougher point, and then the back half of the year will have political advertising, which takes a little bit -- for a full-year perspective, takes a little bit of the sting out of the collapse that we're seeing inside of Q2. And there's nothing about us that's unique there. The CapEx side, I think, it's way too early. I think all we're signaling at this point is that, we've been focused on a lot of different activities right now and there is the possibility that some of the programs that we've had, it might be slightly delayed. Construction could be slightly delayed. Your installation CapEx certainly -- on one hand, going to be lower, because of a lower unit cost, because self-installation on the other hand. We're doing a lot of installations. The volume is very-very high as Tom mentioned. So, there's a lot of moving parts there, but if we had to guess, I will probably be slightly off relative to the dollar amount that we intend to spend. I think Craig asked at the very beginning of the Q&A, are there areas that we could accelerate our spend, given the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of the business and we'll be moving from a reactive mode into very much a proactive to thinking about how -- what are the things that we could do longer term to even take more advantage of the assets we have. So, I don't want to prejudice too much other than to say, right now and the path that we are on, it probably looks like it would be slight minimal lower dollar amount than we intended to spend.\nTom Rutledge: The thing I would say about capital spending is, we talked about it in terms of pressure testing really, and we haven't changed our commitment to the projects that we're building and the products that we're building, and we're continuing to take the business forward. But a lot of our capital is success based, and so it's modulated automatically by customer creation. And so to the extent that the market moves around based on the macroeconomic effects, so does capital.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thanks guys.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, that concludes our call.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you all very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Our first quarter results were strong and reflect where we were heading as a company before the COVID-19 crisis started here in the U.S. Our residential customer relationship net additions increased versus the prior year in each month of the first quarter, and we were driving increasingly efficient operations given our customer friendly operating strategy and growing our free cash flow quickly. Residential revenue grew by 4.2% in the quarter, primarily driven by accelerating relationship growth in similar PSU bundled and video mix trends we've been seeing over several quarters. SMB revenue grew by 5.4%. Enterprise revenue declined by 3.2% year-over-year, driven by the sale of Navisite and by continued pressure from the wholesale side of the business. Excluding both cell tower backhaul and Navisite, enterprise grew by 6.9%. First quarter advertising revenue grew by 5.7% driven by political. In the month of March, non-political advertising revenue declined by 18.7% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID-19 related softness, including the abrupt postponement of sporting events. Mobile revenue totaled $258 million with $131 million of that being device revenue. In total consolidated first quarter revenue was up 4.8% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses in the first quarter; total operating expenses grew by $191 million or 2.7% year-over-year. Cable operating expenses excluding mobile grew by 1.1% year-over-year or 1.7%, excluding Navisite, that's despite faster relationship and revenue growth. Programming increased 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting the same rate, volume and mix considerations that we've seen and talked about in prior quarters and we also had over $20 million of non-recurring programming benefits this quarter. Regulatory connectivity and produced content expenses decreased by 1.7% year-over-year, driven by lower regulatory fees and a $20 million benefit from the timing of sports rights payments. Cost of service customers increased by 1.4% year-over-year, compared to 4.5% customer relationship growth. That expense includes roughly $30 million for recently accelerated hourly wage increases and COVID-19 benefits, as well as $25 million of incremental estimated bad debt for COVID impacts as of March 31st. Excluding bad debt expense in both years, Q1 cost to service customers declined by 0.7%. We continue to meaningfully lower our per relationship service cost. Cable marketing expenses increased by 4.2% year-over-year, driven by higher labor cost and commissions. And mobile expenses totaled $374 million and they were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and MVNO usage cost and operating expenses. In total, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 8.4% in the quarter, when including our mobile EBITDA loss of $116 million. Cable adjusted EBITDA grew by 8.1%. We generated $396 million in net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter and capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion. We generated $1.4 billion of consolidated free cash flow, and excluding our investment in mobile, we generated $1.6 billion of cable free cash, up about $700 million versus last year's first quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.2 million Charter shares and Charter Holding common units, totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $490 per share. Let me briefly turn to our customer results before addressing our business outlook in more detail. Including the impact of COVID-19 related customer offers and programs. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by close to 1.3 million over the last 12 months or by 4.5% and by 486,000 relationships in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 582,000 in the quarter, and by close to 1.6 million or 6.1% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 70,000 in the quarter, better than last year's first quarter decline of 145,000. In wireline, voice declined by 65,000, which was also better than last year's first quarter decline of 99,000. Through February, total customer relationships, internet and video net additions were all better year-over-year, and mobile net additions had continued to accelerate. By mid-March, due to increased social distancing practices and shelter-in-place orders throughout the country, demand increased significantly for our products, but we temporarily yielded less mobile, as sales call time focused on self-installation instructions and our mobile retail channel has been partially impacted. Also beginning in mid-March, we introduced three COVID-19 related offers and programs for our customers. In today's materials, we provided an addendum showing customer counts for each of these. I expect we'll continue to report this addendum for a couple of quarters to provide investors the transparency on the impact of our COVID-19 related offers and programs. The first of three offers available for customers is our 60 day free Internet offer for new Internet customers with students or educators in the household. We launched the offer in mid-March and it accounted for 119,000 of our 582,000 total Internet net additions in the quarter. At the end of March, we still had a large number of pending connects, in customers and the offer continue to grow at a fast pace in April. Interestingly, and uniquely, about 50% of the customers who participated in the offer in March chose to order additional products with immediate billing. The vast majority of these customers are taking our flagship Internet product at 200 megabits per second or 100 megabits per second, and a small minority subscribe to our low-income offer or our ultra and 1 gigabit premium offerings. The profile of these customers is very similar to the profile of our typical Internet customer acquisition stream, and while some of these customers will no longer subscribe to some of these services after 60 days, the payment trends for customers who took video and phone at the same time, already indicate to us that most of these customers will remain. The second offer of our customer category reflects customers under our 60 day keep Americans connected pledged to the FCC. These are customers who have indicated inability to pay for the service for COVID-19 related reasons. As of March 31, 140,000 residential customers were in this program, many who would have been in a collection cycle in normal circumstances, and only 1,000 of which had passed the point in the collection cycle, where we've -- normally disconnected their service at March 31. To give this some color, approximately 20% of the 140,000 customers today have balances which are fully current, and in total, nearly 50% have made partial or full payments entering into this protection program. However, approximately 65,000 of those customers now have past-due balances beyond the point of normal disconnections, meaning at the end of April. The number of customers requesting disconnection protection has continued to grow in April, and we expect it to grow further through the rest of Q2. We intend to work with these COVID-19 impacted customers to get them back in a good payment status, with the objective of fully continuing their service with us. The final category of customers we've isolated in our addendum, our SMB customers who have requested a seasonal suspension of service or temporary downgrade of a line of service, while their operations are closed or diminished. Certain restaurants, bars and hotels are good examples, where we've reduced service to a minimum level, and reduced the monthly bill, until these customers fully reopen. We also expect this category to grow in Q2. So what does all this mean beyond temporary ARPU dislocation and back-end subscriber risk? First, even if you exclude the impact of these offers and programs from our first quarter results, residential customer relationships and Internet grew at a faster pace year-over-year, that remains our long-term opportunity. Second, customers may move in, out or between these categories over time, as the economy contracts and ultimately expands. Our issue is not demand for our products, it will be our customers' ability to pay and how we help them in that respect over time. So, until we have a better sense for the depth and the duration of the COVID-19 crisis and its economic impact, it's difficult for us to project what the help we offer our customers will look like. However, we think we could end up creating more value over the long term, as we continue to treat our customers and our employees well. With that in mind, I'd like to expand on Tom's remarks as it relates to our business outlook and where we're likely to see pressure and opportunities over the coming months and quarters, depending how and when the economy reaccelerates. For our residential and mobile services, the quality and value of our products are clear and demand is high, with Internet up in March significantly, even without the COVID-19 related offers. And video and phone also saw positive net adds in March, at least temporarily. Looking forward, the risk of the household formation growth will be impacted. The other issue will be customers' ability to pay either via their wages or extended employment benefits under the Cares Act or other stimulus packages. And if, how and over what period of time, you can get some customers to repay back balances when they are able to make payments again. So there are all kinds of questions here, about financial presentation, accounts receivables revenue recognition, bad debt provision, and write-offs, which really reflected in Q2 and will work through in the coming months and quarters, and we intend to provide our investors transparency, as we go through our unique reporting exercise. When the economy begins to recover and assuming our customers can pay us, I expect our residential business will be in a good shape. SMB represented $3.9 billion of revenue for us last year or 8.5% of our total revenue. In the back half of March, we began to see softness in our SMB sales, where essentially our direct sales force has been on hold and that channel is a larger contributor to SMB sales than it is to residential. We estimate that less than 20% of our SMB customers are restaurants, hotels, bars, theaters and the like, many of which will struggle in this downturn. We are working with all of our SMB customers in this difficult time, and believe we can return to growth in an economic recovery. We expect to retail base for enterprise to be more stable. In March and April, we saw significant demand from healthcare and government segments to upgrade and add new services, which is taking the place of new connects and other areas. But we expect new sales to taper off in retail services growth in the short term, for enterprise will be moderated by customers' willingness to make changes, particularly for physical services in this climate. We will have an offsetting benefit in churn, but absent higher new sales, it will be difficult to grow retail enterprise significantly in the short term. For Spectrum Reach, our advertising group the second quarter will be challenging. March revenue was below our expectations by more than $30 million due to cancellations and the April variance was more than double that amount. We are proactively working with clients to move their advertising spend from sports events to reach their audiences in different places or to move out there orders generally. We believe there is an opportunity to both recover and earn more advertising business, once the economy picks back up. We still expect significant political spend in the back half of this year, so the full year impact won't be as dramatic on a year-over-year basis. Those are the short-term revenue challenges and the long-term opportunities, what are the potential offsets in our cost structure? Churn across all of our subscription services was already declining significantly before the crisis. Lower churn and voluntary churn is declining even more now, but new sales will also decline, all of which says that we expected much lower level of service calls, truck rolls, installations, commissions and labor-related activity, that applies to residential, SMB and enterprise. As Tom mentioned, self-installation is now over 90%, up from 55% in the first part of the first quarter, and with utilization of digital self-care up over 30%, our integration investments and our self-service platforms and portals are paying off. The current prices has accelerated customers' adoption curve for digital service, and we don't think it goes back to where it was. So outside of bad debt and some accelerated wage increases to our frontline, our cost of service will decrease with less activity. Employee turnover will decline and hiring activity is likely to slow across the business, which has direct cost and tenure benefits, and we think any remaining EBITDA shortfall relative to our plans would likely be offset by CapEx, that would be lower than previously expected, due to higher self-installation, lower churn, the timing of scalable infrastructure spend and potential construction delays. So that's how we believe the model will flex. What we don't know, is the depth and duration of a recession, but we like our business model, how we manage the business across various climates and we believe we can grow long-term. It's probably a good transition to the balance sheet and our liquidity profile. As Tom mentioned, we have done a lot of modeling to stress test our balance sheet under various economic scenarios. We finished the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and $4.7 billion of availability under our revolver. In early March, at the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis, we priced a long-dated high yield financing at an all-time low coupon, and on April 17, we issued $3 billion of our tightest coupons ever for 10-year and 30 year investment grade tranches. Pro forma for those investment grade bonds and recently called debt at March 31, we had $8.4 billion of total available liquidity. As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.4 times or 4.3 times, if you look at cable only. In that respect we've already been deleveraging slightly. Pro forma for our recent financing activities, our weighted average cost of debt is only 4.9% and the weighted average life of our debt is 12.2 years, with more than 90% of our debt maturing beyond 2022. We have a schedule on slide 13 of today's presentation, which puts our maturity profile in perspective relative to last year's cable EBITDA. Together with our significant liquidity and positive free cash flow, we remain in a very good position to finance our operations organically, as well as through the capital markets, which remain open to Charter. As it relates to our stock repurchases, we've been under a 10b5-1 plan which was entered into, right before the COVID-19 crisis began here in the U.S. Due to lower share prices in March, we purchased more the target volume in March than April. We have never provided guidance on buybacks, because we think it can encourage bad decision making relative to better alternative uses of cash over time. So we're going to be thoughtful and responsive to where we think the economy is going, our stock price, our liquidity and any organic or organic opportunities, inorganic opportunities which may arise. While the current environment does suggest caution in the short term, we are not modifying our 4 to 4.5 times leverage target range today and we'll continue to monitor the economic climate and the interest rate market and regularly evaluating our leverage target. We know that we have a high quality resilient asset with dedicated employees across our local communities and we've invested significantly in our network and people over the years and there is high demand for our product across every part of our footprint, in both homes and businesses in good times and bad, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings, and ensure that our network is well invested, ready and working for future opportunities. Our goal is to stay focused on what we do well, and execute a proven operating strategy that works for customers and employees across various economic and regulatory climate, to create shareholder value over the long term. Operator, we're now ready for questions. We are growing market share everywhere. Sure. Mike, on the SMB; I mean, I'd just put it a little bit in perspective, it's 8.5% of our revenue and so you can get to some pretty wicked scenarios and it's still doesn't have that material of an impact to the company. Certainly, when you're talking about liquidity our balance sheet perspective. It has an impact on the revenue growth rate for the entire company and so I think, given some of the stats that I was providing inside the prepared remarks, the idea was that people can take your own view of how bad, in particular, that segment of bars, restaurants and theaters could be hit and for how long and that will give you some sensitivity of what the trough looks like. We are not anymore than anybody else in terms of the depth and duration of the recession, but that's why we wanted to give some of those starts to give a framework for you think about it. The second question was -- first one was SMB, the second was? Well, every company has had to modify to new GAAP standard, which requires you to estimate your bad debt reserves for the receivables that you have at a period of time, as opposed to when they age. And so you've heard everybody talk about that this quarter. We're no different. We had in total between cable mobile, about $30 million of additional bad debt as an estimate for what might not be payable on the accounts receivables that existed at the time of close. In Q2, let me start maybe back with the first objective. Our goal through all of this, is A, to do well by the customer, by providing good offers for remote education, as well as for in this case, keep America connected pledge. But our goal is also not going to be to quickly get into a collection environment and cut them off. Our goal is going to be to keep these customers. And in the second quarter, to the extent that we work with the customer to right-size their receivable, some of that could impact the revenue recognition inside of Q2, and some of that for a financed a portion that they may need to pay back over time, could impact our estimate for bad debt reserve. That will apply for residential and SMB. And so, when I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we're going to have a lot of technical accounting and reporting issues to deal with in Q2, it's true, but we're going to be focused on not the accounting outcome or how Q2 is going to look, we're going to be focused on what's the right long-term outcome for the customers, and for the company and make sure that the accounting does what's appropriate on the back end. But I think will be a little bit of noise and we'll make sure that we disclosed any revenue impacts in any bad debt impacts in our Q2 reporting. And Jonathan, you -- go ahead. Yes, I don't want to get into a percentage margin discussion. But the cost of a self-installation is about a third of the cost of a professional install and the benefit of that ensures to both OpEx and CapEx, depending on what type of installation it is. So it's significant. But keep in mind that we were already at 55%, we would have been at 70% by the end of the quarter, absent the acceleration. Your second question was on non-programming expense. There is marketing, there is advertising expense, there's enterprise expenses in this, so I prefer to think about cost to service customers, which is really the residential and SMB cost to provide network operations, field operations and customer service operations to call centers and billing. Just the bulk of our costs. That cost, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, absent leaving side just bad debt was down year-over-year in gross dollars, and it was down as a per relationship basis. And I know I've cautioned in the past that what we're committed to is, that per relationship to cost to serve is going to continue to decline, and I've been hesitant to say that the dollar cost to serve, excluding bad that would also decline on a gross basis. Clearly, it would've inside of Q1 year-over-year and given that we do expect -- once we get beyond April, April has been a high activity month. We think that transaction -- sales transactions and move churn and all of the different service transactions will start to slow down. And so that could actually accelerate excluding bad debt, the cost to serve declines year-over-year, certainly on a per relationship basis. So, I think the trends there are good and they continue -- there is an increase in the amount of our labor expense, because we accelerated the path that Tom was already putting the company on, to a $20 minimum wage and that was $30 million in the quarter for really a month and a half of expense. So yes, that will get annualized at the appropriate rate. But I think that's a small dollar amount relative to the amount of transactions that come out of the business and I think our operating strategy fully funds that, and the acceleration of the adoption of self-service and self-install are very helpful and making that viable for not just our employees, but for all stakeholders. Then on the M&A framework, on the inorganic side, I think the prospect is probably more actionable on the organic side, some of the things that Tom has also talked about in the past, but on the inorganic side would be M&A. Nothing has changed with the way that we think about opportunities we -- as Tom just mentioned, we love cable. At the right price we would do cable all day long and that means tack-ons, which means do frequently as we can, as well as bigger acquisitions. That hasn't been the case today. They are mostly family, controlled or family owned and so that will be not in our hands, that will be in the hands of others who decide that. We have looked all around to see if there's anything on the content side, we haven't found anything that really matches up well with our assets and capabilities. Other than some of the local news that we've expanded to organically and that makes a lot of sense for us, and particularly in this environment, it has been a big asset. We've thought a lot about wireless. I think in the assets that we have, the ability to deploy small cells, the attractive MVNO that we have, we haven't found a scenario that made a whole lot of sense for us or for the industry. There are cases that we can take a look at to accelerate growth, whether that's in enterprise or whether that's in wireless technology, where we've made some minority and some joint investments with Comcast. Same would apply to advertising, but none of those are going to be particularly material. They will be great for those segments of business and the ability to accelerate growth hopefully, but it's not going to be something that really materially shows up on the balance sheet and impacts our liquidity. All of which leads you back to and I think unless Tom has got something got something else he'd add, leads you back to -- we think the organic opportunities and if you can't buy somebody else's cable stock, buying more of your stock at some point in the future is probably between organic and that is where we have ended up in the meantime. I had a hard time hearing. So the first question was any new offers including, I think the Sirius trial that we've run out in the marketplace was the question there. And then the second was Peacock, and whether that needs to -- that could happen now or needs to wait until the future renewal. And the third was the HBO Max, to the extent that it impacts the way that we sell the -- or package the HBO product. So the -- and the April comment that I made was really not related to the percentage decline year-over-year, it was really the variance to our, what would have been our expectation. So $30 million we had literally come off the books in March. It was already sold, came off the books. So over twice that, that came off the books for April. We think that will probably be the trough in April, small, start recovery in May and maybe depending on how they openings occur, June start to come back. So Q2 is going to be a rough advertising. It's not a big part of our business, but it's going to be a rough advertising quarter. We do think as things come back online, there'll be some pent-up demand for advertising on the core local, which for us has been growing, our core business has been growing at 3% to 4% year-over-year, on top of that there will be pent-up demand. So whenever the market opens back up and a lot of that tied to the health of SMBs and when the recession or when the distancing starts to open back up, Q2 will be the rougher point, and then the back half of the year will have political advertising, which takes a little bit -- for a full-year perspective, takes a little bit of the sting out of the collapse that we're seeing inside of Q2. And there's nothing about us that's unique there. The CapEx side, I think, it's way too early. I think all we're signaling at this point is that, we've been focused on a lot of different activities right now and there is the possibility that some of the programs that we've had, it might be slightly delayed. Construction could be slightly delayed. Your installation CapEx certainly -- on one hand, going to be lower, because of a lower unit cost, because self-installation on the other hand. We're doing a lot of installations. The volume is very-very high as Tom mentioned. So, there's a lot of moving parts there, but if we had to guess, I will probably be slightly off relative to the dollar amount that we intend to spend. I think Craig asked at the very beginning of the Q&A, are there areas that we could accelerate our spend, given the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of the business and we'll be moving from a reactive mode into very much a proactive to thinking about how -- what are the things that we could do longer term to even take more advantage of the assets we have. So, I don't want to prejudice too much other than to say, right now and the path that we are on, it probably looks like it would be slight minimal lower dollar amount than we intended to spend."

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. First, on behalf of all of us at Charter, let me express our concerns for those who have been impacted by the COVID-19 crisis in our local communities we serve, as we endure together an extremely serious health, social and economic crisis. The hard work and dedication of Charter's 95,000 employees has been remarkable. We're all proud of how we're serving our customers at this time. Charter's employees are in trucks, in the field, call centers, dispatch network operation centers, their homes, and retail stores, where we provide customer equipment and numerous support functions that enable our company to service our customers. We remain focused on our customers and communities and we've been able to deliver our connectivity services without interruption to our customers across the country. We know our role as a provider of communication services and the importance of keeping connectivity services fully functioning for both new and existing households and businesses, which enable social distancing, including remote working, distance learning, telehealth services and family communications. In mid-March as part of our effort to keep America connected during this crisis, we pledged to do a number of things. We committed to offer Spectrum Internet for free for 60 days to households with students or educators, who do not already have a Spectrum Internet subscription. We recently announced that we are extending the availability of this offering through June 30. As of March 31, we added approximately 120,000 customers connected under this offer, with many more installed in April. By the end of the school year, we expect that this offer will have helped approximately 400,000 students and teachers, and their families continue schooling through remote learning. For 60 days, we also committed to suspend collection activities, not terminate service for residential or small or medium business customers, who are experiencing COVID-19 related economic challenges. We also extended the availability of this offer to June 30. Additionally, we've opened our WiFi hotspots across our footprint for public use and we've prioritized over 1,000 requests from government, healthcare and educational institutions for new fiber connections, bandwidth upgrades and new services, that includes major hospital groups and the two U.S. Naval hospitals in New York and Los Angeles. And Spectrum News has opened its websites to ensure people have access to high quality local news and information. We've also donated significant airtime to run public service announcements to our whole footprint of 16 million video subscribers. Charter provides essential service, and we've been working to keep America connected working and learning, while at the same time, protecting our employees. We've instituted guidelines in our call centers that enhance social distancing between employees, including enabling a significant percentage of those employees for remote work. We've also altered our field operations protocol, by aggressively moving to customer self-installation. So while we continue to operate at nearly full capability, we're taking the necessary precautions to promote the safety of our employees. We're also providing our employees with outstanding benefits. We've implemented an additional two weeks of paid sick time for COVID related illnesses, for when we ask an employee to self-quarantine. We've given every employee an additional 15 days of COVID-19 related flex time to address other COVID related issues, including caring for children and dependents. In early April, we increased our wage for all hourly field operations and customer service call center employees by a $1.50 per hour back to February. We also committed to raising our minimum wage for hourly workers to at least $20 an hour over the next two years. We are paying employees in parts of our business like residential and SMB direct sales, whose work has been put on hold, and to reinforce our commitment to employees we announced that for 60 days no employee will be laid off or furloughed. We have a great business with employees committed to our mission and that will ensure that we are able to excel through the eventual economic recovery. We continue to perform well operationally, both through the end of the Q1 and now. In first quarter, we added 580,000 residential and SMB Internet customers. We had a good quarter, driven by demand for our higher quality products. We also saw an increase in the number of residential and business customers, upgrading their speed. Our ability to provision the outsized demand we saw in the quarter, has been a result of the investments that we have made over the last several years in our insourced and onshore high quality workforce, significant systems integration and automation, our online and digital sales and self-service platforms and our self-installation program. In fact, we accelerated the expansion of our customer self-installation from 55% of sales at the beginning of the quarter to nearly 70% at the end of the quarter to over 90% today. Data usage and traffic on our network also grew significantly during the quarter. In March Residential data usage for Internet-only customers was over 600 gigabytes per month, up over 20% since the fourth quarter. Our customers are benefiting from a continually decreasing price per gigabit. Peak traffic levels remain well below maximum capability. Our network as well as those of other cable operators in the U.S. and performed better than networks in other countries, because of the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our plan, like the recent rollout of 1 gig everywhere. The pro investment regulatory climate has made this possible. Over the coming years, we will invest in our network, as we built the lower density in rural communities and pursue our 10G plan, which provides a cost-efficient pathway for us to offer multi-gigabit speeds, lower latency, high compute services to consumers and businesses customers. With our inside-out strategy, we will continue to use and develop small wireless cells, powered by our network, together with our MVNO to connect customers in and beyond the home, delivering our throughput and economics for customers in fixed, nomadic and mobile environments. Our strategy will be enhanced by the FCC recently freeing up 1,200 megahertz of 6 gigahertz spectrum for WiFi. The FCC's action is a transformational step toward broadband in America. It was a bold move and we look forward to making significant use of the spectrum. Moving back to Q1 results, we also performed well from a financial perspective during the quarter. We grew adjusted EBITDA by 8.4% and combined with our lower cable capital expenditures, our first quarter free cash flow grew by over 100% year-over-year. As we look forward, we would expect that demand for our residential broadband product will remain strong as people work and learn from home and need to stay connected. Broadly speaking, the health of our residential business will be impacted by what happens to unemployment and income and how long and the impact that such factors will have on customers' ability to pay for service in the coming months, including government support to consumers. Slowing household formation may also play a role and our ability to drive new customer growth, by slowing activity for both new sales and also churn. We also recognize that the recent strength in video and wireline voice trends maybe temporary due to lockdowns and reverse in an economic downturn. So our SMB business is more difficult. We serve approximately 2 million SMB customers and many of those customers are currently closed at least temporarily. As a result, SMB customer growth and revenue growth will be lower than our previous expectations. It will likely take time for this part of our business to recover, but it will and maybe with a faster growth rate than before the crisis. I expect our enterprise business to remain more stable than SMB. Enterprise customers are larger and most but not all will be able to stand the recession more than smaller businesses that have less liquidity. But our expectations for enterprise customers and revenue growth have also been tempered, as enterprise customers with complex products are less likely to switch and grant installation access in this environment. Our advertising business is inherently local and primarily supported by small and medium businesses, which have been hurt in the crisis, but we still expect political advertising to be meaningful, which will help us, particularly in the back half of the year. So clearly our revenue growth rate will be less than what we anticipated. But as service transactions and sales slow for the market as a whole, and customer adoption of self-service accelerates, there are a number of operating cost improvements and capital expenditure delays that will help cash flow growth now and in the future. We also believe that on a relative basis, we're in a far better position than most companies, as the value and demand for our service is significant and we're operating efficiently in serving our communities well, as we always have in a crisis. Chris will cover the potential impacts to our 2020 financials and reporting in more detail, but I want to be clear that, while we don't know the depth and duration of the impacts of social distancing, we pressure tested our business model, our liquidity and balance sheet through various scenarios. Our analysis confirms what we have always believed that we remain well positioned. Overall, we fully expect to be in good shape over the long term and we believe our business will continue to do very well, given the assets and products we have and the continued investment in those assets, our customers and our employees. Before turning the call over to Chris, I'd like to thank Charter's employees for their hard work and dedication and diligence through this crisis. They've been asked to go well above and beyond their regular duties and they've delivered, easing the strain for millions of families. The positive feedback we've received from our customers is very gratifying and we continue to treat our customers with respect, compassion and support and continue to deliver great products and services. We will come out strong around the other side of this crisis. We still have a lot of work in front of us, but I am heartened by how we have risen to the challenge, and know that we will continue to deliver for our customers and for America, regardless of what comes our way. I'd also like to send my regards and best wishes to all of those listening to this call, may you and your families remain safe and healthy. Now, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Craig, obviously we think about that every day and we have some cash on hand to be opportunistic, if there is an opportunity that would require investment. But, the biggest opportunity we see, is to continue doing what we're doing and just doing it better and well and being able to execute better and well and continue to succeed in the marketplace. Our biggest opportunity as a company is to continue to create customer relationships, and we think that we have a great set of assets that we've put together and invested in properly and therefore, we have advantages in terms of the products that we can sell relative to others at the moment, and we have a high quality, high skilled workforce that's capable of generating and operating activity, and that's our biggest direct upside, and we think we could continue to operate well and execute well going forward and to the extent that we're better at that than others, we create more value, more quickly. Yes. Well look, I mean we've talked for years about the reality of programming costs and how sports drives the bulk of the programming cost. If you look at our average cost of programming per customer in the high $60 range on average, that's the wholesale cost that we're planning for customer. My guess is that, if sports was not involved in the negotiations for the creation of that cost, that it would be less than half of what it is. So sports is the major driver in the cost of content, and obviously it makes the whole product difficult to sell because of the cost that consumers have to pay and the effect of -- I mean just simply, it's a very expensive product and people have a hard time paying for it. The reality is that, we would love to pass through the sports programming costs back to the customer, if it isn't paid or the events don't occur. There is still a big question about whether the games are going to be playing, and if they are played, most likely, the costs will not be rebated to the customers. So, I don't -- at this point in time, we have a structure in the industry in how we pay for content. It's all bundled together and tied together contractually and we have very little control over directly. So we'd love to see our customers relieved if they can be. Ultimately, it's the athletes who are getting the money and at some point, somebody has to give up their money and give it back to the customer and that hasn't happened yet. Well in terms of variation by various parts of the country, obviously there are reopenings occurring and we're preparing to operate differently in different parts of the country, depending on what the local regulatory climate is with regard to what's allowed from a business practice perspective. As an essential business, we've been operating the whole time, and obviously we have to keep our business running. So we've been running it under the tightest conditions that exist in terms of what we can do and how we have to take care of our employees and how we have to take care of our customers. So as we begin to see places opening up, we are preparing to respond to the local markets individually and to project our capability locally. I can't tell you that I can see at this moment any differences from one location to another, in terms of -- New York City's a unique place, but it's unique in every way, always is, but broadly speaking, we've been locked down everywhere until now and... We are growing consistently everywhere. Now in terms of the future of the network and the load on it, we've been able to handle the very quick change in demand and one interesting thing about -- the demand has gone up a lot in terms of network utilization, but it's also spread out. You build your network to maximum peak utilization and not total utilization. So it's the Mother's Day call effect from a network build perspective. You build for the one day a year, when you need every bit of your network. And the network has been built and it's absorbed what we think of, as a year's worth of augmentation in a few weeks. But the general trend that we now see in a few weeks, has been going on for quite a long time, and we expect it to continue. And so we have a pathway in terms of our assets to developing what we think the future communications is, including an upstream capability, as upstream utilization continues to grow. So that's what we call 10G, it's also called DOCSIS 4.0, in terms of the way we describe it from a specifications perspective. But we are still rapidly moving down the path of augmenting our networks in smart ways and capital efficient ways to continue to allow capacity to grow and to create new products that are hard to even envision, and we think that we're very well positioned to do that over the long term, it's going to require continued investment, but a proportional investment that's significantly less than any sort of brand-new build. So we think we're in a great position to make those investments and to realize the benefits of them, and to create the new products that are going to come from the. But we don't have an immediate upstream problem and we don't have a downstream problem, we have opportunities in both places in the long run. Well, in terms of the -- good -- I understand your question, are you saying that the FCC's 6 gigahertz WiFi Spectrum affect our valuation of CBRS? The answer is no. They're really separate notions. I look at the 6 gigahertz spectrum as inside-house type spectrum; so all of our products are delivered wirelessly. So the real issue is mobility versus stationary or sedentary behavior, and the 6 gigahertz spectrum is really for in-house, high capacity use for a whole new set of products that will come along. The CBRS spectrum really allows for a more efficient use of the mobile platform, at least the way we look at it. Although it could be used indoors as well and it could be used indoors, both for mobile service and enterprise environments and externally and so we see them as separate notions and separate values and it hasn't affected -- one hasn't affected the other, in our view. Regarding sports rights, everybody misses sports and it really -- it obviously is an extremely valuable product and it is the glue that holds the bundle together, and you know, assuming that sports come back and that leagues generally play, the secular trends that are going on shouldn't change, in my view, the same forces will exist going forward that existed before the crisis. So absent a complete collapse of the sports business, I don't see a major change. Yes, go ahead. So, that's kind of an accounting explanation. The way I look at bad debt is have you created customers and that you keep them and do they pay you? And if you create customers and they pay you, that's good and if you don't get a lot of bad debt. And, when I look at the customers that we're creating, we have -- they're taking our high quality products in the residential space and they, from a profile perspective, they look like the customers that we've always created, and so they're going to be affected by the macro climate, obviously, but we have products that we can sell to those customers that have value regardless of what -- where they fall in the income range, we sell to very poor people and we sell to very rich people and we have a product mix that can work across the entire marketplace. So, I'm confident that we can create valuable customer relationships through time. Even in the small business arena, we're still creating customers today, and even in -- if you think about the restaurant business which is closed, the vast majority of those customer relationships are still intact. They still want websites and they may have taken out businesses or whatever, but even if the business is closed, doesn't mean that they don't want to have a relationship with us. What's good for churn? Look churn was before the impact of COVID, our churn was coming down steadily and we've all -- everything we've done post-COVID has been consistent with the strategies that we had before, in terms of having high quality service, high quality products, high quality workers, in-sourced in the United States, who are trained and capable of providing excellent service. If you do that, you have less activity, and the ultimate value proposition that drives the cost to serve is activity. I mean, if you can -- if your service is better and your products have longer lives, inherently, you have less activity per dollar of revenue generated, which means that you have a higher margin or lower cost to serve. And churn is one of the measurement of customer satisfaction. It's also a measure of mobility in the economy and other things of that nature, but all of those things being held constant, if your churn rate is going down, it means your customer satisfaction is going up, because your products are better and that's been our objective in terms of managing the company and still is. So the legacy Charter platform, churn was coming down and legacy Time Warner platform and legacy Bright House platform, churn was coming down across all of those businesses, and cost to serve was coming down too because of the self-installation models and all digital models in terms of digital type flows that we created, allow for ease from a consumer perspective of dealing with us and less friction than the actual transaction, because a point is necessary to keep for that process to occur, and all of that creates less activity and higher satisfaction, which is a very virtuous cycle in the sense that, if you have less activity and you have less failure in your activities, meaning you have less service calls, you will have less missed appointments, you actually create more satisfaction, which extends subscriber life even longer, which by itself, reduces activity. So that was the path we were on and it's still, I believe in the path we're on. It's a little bit confused by the volume that we're currently under. We've had an enormous uptick in activity in the last two months due to sales. And interestingly, we've created in the last 60 days, 10,000 new broadband customers a day, so 600,000 customers in 60 days. That's a lot of work and we've done that pretty seamlessly. So Jonathan, on secular change. I would say it this way, I don't know that they're permanently changed, but they are permanently advanced. Meaning, we took years of secular change and compressed it into a very short period of time, and we're not going to go back to the original trend line. We may have just moved way up the trend line. And I think network utilization is one of those, and I think customer self-serve is the other and the cost to serve, as a result of that. We were already fairly down -- far down the road in the customer self-service model, and we were fortunate when we got hit with what we did, and with the marketing tactics that we employed, that we were able to actually deal with it, because we had started the quarter in the 55% range, I think of self-installation and we were about at 70%, when everything changed, and we're over 90% now of self-installation. So the fact that we were already at 70%, allowed us to get to 90% with a fair degree of operational efficiency. And so we were prepared fortunately at that moment. But I think that's a big change in the business going forward and I think people using Zoom and other kinds of two-way communications in a work like environment in their homes is probably advanced by a number of years for the long term. Well, Ben, I -- and I've always loved the cable industry and what it does. And I've always thought that it has done great things consistently. As you think about the upsides of our reputation, we transform telecommunications and if you think -- I remember just 15 years ago, 20 years ago the average wireline phone bill was $75 in the New York area, today it's $9.99. And if you look at what the cost of broadband was, particularly on a per-gigabit basis, think about dial-up, AOL dial-up in the year 2001, when they acquired Time Warner, was $20 bucks a month, then you got 56K. The cost of broadband has gone way down and the telecommunications outputs of the investments that the cable industry has made have been tremendous in terms of the benefits that it's created for consumers. Nobody likes paying their cable bill and nobody likes paying for programming costs, and that's always been a difficult aspect of our business, since we've had competition in video, since the rise of satellite and the cable industry had to divest itself of programming essentially, because of the vertical integration rules. The programming cost have increased massively, because programming is a copyright, which is a legal monopoly and they've had pricing power over a competitive video business and consumers don't like that and -- but now you have the rise of a-la-carte direct-to-consumer programming in Netflix and Warner Home Media and Disney and so forth, and so a lot of our customers have the video they want to buy at prices they want to pay and so I think it's -- the biggest driver of negativity in the cable business I think has been the price of video, and to some extent that's breaking up. So I'm relatively optimistic about our status and I think that when you really look at it objectively, we have done great things and I think that the facilities based competition model that we have in the country has done a really great job of producing really high quality communication services consumers. In terms of our offer strategy, I wouldn't disclose those before we do them. We experiment with various offers through time. But not to minimize our marketing prowess, but we -- ultimately it's -- do you have good products and are they worth that cost and that's what affects your ability to sell and succeed in the marketplace. But we experiment with the marketing tactics all the time, and Sirius is one of them, and so we don't have any announcements about future tactics that we might employ. In terms of Peacock, we have ongoing discussions with NBC and we haven't concluded anything yet. In terms of HBO Max, we just completed an agreement with AT&T, and we're going to convert our customers who have HBO to the new product and then we're going to market the new product as part of our overall video offering. And we look forward to doing that. The thing I would say about capital spending is, we talked about it in terms of pressure testing really, and we haven't changed our commitment to the projects that we're building and the products that we're building, and we're continuing to take the business forward. But a lot of our capital is success based, and so it's modulated automatically by customer creation. And so to the extent that the market moves around based on the macroeconomic effects, so does capital. Thank you all very much."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future.

Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today\u2019s call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the fourth quarter with solid customer growth and strong financial growth. In October, we launched our new Spectrum Mobile multiline pricing and packaging, which allows Spectrum Mobile customers to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on their personal communication spend. We had our strongest mobile quarter ever with 380,000 line net adds. For the full year 2021, we added 940,000 new customer relationships, and we added over 1.2 million Internet customers for growth of over 4%. We also grew our mobile lines by 1.2 million. Financials were also strong in 2021. We grew full year revenue and EBITDA by 7.5% and 11.4%, respectively, and free cash flow grew by 23% year-over-year to $8.7 billion. As we look forward to the rest of this year, we remain focused on several strategic priorities and goals, including product development and network evolution, our rural construction initiative and driving customer growth and penetration. And although the business environment in which we\u2019re operating remains unusual, we believe our goals and priorities will continue to foster our growth and prepare us well when the marketplace returns to historical levels of marketplace activity and sales. Fundamental to our success is the delivery of products and services that are superior to what our competitors can offer. Delivering more speed and throughput to our customers remains a key area of focus. In December, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And nearly 25% of our non-video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. So we continue to see very high demand for throughput by our customers. In order to increase the capacity of our network for next-generation products and services, we\u2019ve developed a multi-faceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies, which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. In 2022, we\u2019ll increase the number of projects to deploy high splits in our service areas. High splits are powerful, cost-efficient upgrades that use our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure and allow us to comfortably offer gigabit speeds at symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Additionally, high splits will significantly reduce our network augmentation capital spending, including node spending. We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 technology, plant architecture and rollout, which will allow us to cost efficiently offer higher multi-gigabit speeds in the future. We recently ran a DOCSIS 4.0 test using Frequency Division Duplexing, and we successfully delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream, and there\u2019s more to come from that technology. Other areas of product development in 2022 include speed boosting our WiFi connections, while Spectrum Mobile customers are on their Spectrum Mobile devices connected to any Spectrum WiFi access point enabled for mobile service. We also just turned on 5G C-band for all Spectrum Mobile customers who have a C-band enabled device, which means they can get faster 5G speeds while on the go. Both of the speed boosting enhancements I just mentioned are included in our mobile pricing at no extra charge. We\u2019re also rolling out our 5G hybrid mobile network operation using CBRS small cells in a full market area allowing selected participants to connect to our CBRS small cell access points when they\u2019re outside of WiFi coverage. By furthering the convergence of our fixed and mobile broadband service, we not only improve the economics of our mobile business but improve the customer experience. In fact, for the last 10 quarters, Global Wireless Solutions has ranked our mobile service the fastest in the country because we combine our Internet and mobile connectivity together with our state-of-the-art WiFi service. Another key piece of our long-term strategy is treating customer service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their Spectrum services and interactions with us whenever and however they want. We continue to work on improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing and monetizing a number of elements of our customer, field and network operations groups. Our rural construction initiative also remains a key focus. Our multiyear, multibillion-dollar construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country. Through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, or RDOF, we will add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next five years. We\u2019re also in the midst of hiring more than 2,000 employees and contractors to support our rural expansion. But our rural construction initiative is not limited to RDOF commitments. We\u2019ll continue to build in other rural areas as well, and we will pursue opportunities to receive broadband stimulus funds, including the American Rescue Plan Act funds and funds from Infrastructure Investment Act and Jobs Act. We\u2019ll also extend our network passed homes in areas adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not currently reach today. Ultimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but it\u2019s also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns. Finally, as we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving customer growth, market share growth and penetration by offering high-quality products and services at attractive prices. Our network allows us to deliver a unique, fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, Slide 4 in the presentation shows we only capture about 27% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there\u2019s a large opportunity for us to increase the market share with superior products, saving customers money and through our latest offering, we can do that. An average household mobile broadband spend with two lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband is approximately $200 a month. With our new multiline pricing and packaging launched in October, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and two lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less and save at least $700 a year. So far, we\u2019ve seen a very strong response to our offering with our fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for mobile lines net adds yet. In fact, despite a very competitive environment, we continue to gain lines at a very rapid pace because of the value in our bundled service offering, which drives more EBITDA and free cash flow per customer and per passing value for shareholders. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Tom. Let\u2019s turn to our customer results on Slides 6 and 7. Please note that we will continue to reference COVID-19-related financial impacts from 2020 and included again on Slides 19 and 20 of today\u2019s presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 120,000 in the fourth quarter and by 939,000 in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 190,000 in the quarter and by 1.2 million or 4.2% over the last 12 months. Although our Internet customer growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, the business environment in which we are operating has not yet normalized. Similar to the third quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 58,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 154,000, and we added 380,000 mobile lines. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 3.6 million mobile lines. And despite the lower numbers of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. Moving to the financial results, starting on Slide 8. Over the last year, we grew residential customers by 847,000 or 2.9%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and $22 million of COVID-related impacts in the prior period. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends that we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Additionally, this quarter includes $31 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video customers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 8 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.1% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and ARPU growth. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 5.8%. This growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $8 million that negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.9%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%. And enterprise PSUs grew by 5.3% year-over-year, a bit faster than last quarter. Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 28.2% year-over-year primarily due to strong political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, partly offset by COVID impacts last year. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, advertising revenue increased by 3.3% primarily due to our growth in advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by local \u2013 lower local ad revenue, particularly automotive. If you exclude automotive, fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Mobile revenue totaled $632 million with $266 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 6.2% year-over-year driven by lower levels of CPE sold to customers. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year. And when excluding advertising, which benefited from political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue grew by 6.4%. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 9. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $203 million or 2.7% year-over-year. Programming costs decreased by 0.5% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 2.3%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $31 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned earlier and $19 million of other favorable adjustments, all of which was partially offset by the high \u2013 by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.2%. Looking at the full year 2022, we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the mid-single digit percentage range. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 11.3% primarily driven by higher Lakers RSN costs, partially offset by lower original programming costs and regulatory and franchise fees. The Lakers cost growth was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove fewer Lakers games charges in Q4 of 2020, making for a challenging comparison to this year. Excluding RSN costs from both years, regulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 3.5%. Cost to service customers declined by 0.5% year-over-year, compared to 3% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs, mostly offset by previously announced wage increases, which will ultimately provide all hourly employees at Charter a starting minimum wage of $20 per hour by the end of the first quarter. Marketing expenses grew by 4.3% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $724 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses declined by 6.5% driven primarily by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year, given the decline in political ad revenue this year and a one-time corporate cost in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 10. We generated $1.6 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $1.2 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 11. Capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with last year\u2019s fourth quarter spend, although the components of that spend were a bit different. Upgrade and rebuild grew by $66 million year-over-year due to plant replacement in those portions of our footprint that were damaged by Hurricane Ida. Scalable infrastructure spends declined by $45 million, given a stabilized level of network traffic growth and investments made earlier this year. We spent $127 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, cable capital intensity was lower than in 2020 and in line with our outlook. As we look to the full year 2022, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures associated with our rural construction initiative, to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. We hope to spend about $1 billion in 2022 on capital expenditures related to our rural construction initiative or our construction within census block groups that are defined as rural. That spending includes our RDOF and other subsidized rural construction projects such as ARPU-related bills and spend associated with extending our plant to rural homes adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not reach today. We may not reach that targeted spend given a number of factors, including pull permitting and equipment and labor availability. Conversely, we continue to bid on additional broadband stimulus projects that could increase 2022 capital spending for overall construction initiative. Given the variables, our actual rural construction initiative spending may differ meaningfully from our target. As Tom mentioned, the expansion of our footprint into rural areas will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns. And we view our rural construction initiative as similar to or equivalent to acquiring a rural cable operator. We plan to begin disclosing additional operating information associated with our rural construction initiative in 2022. Turning to mobile. We expect our full year 2022 mobile capital expenditures to be about $100 million less than our full year 2021 mobile capital spend, which totaled $482 million. Our 2022 mobile capital spend will consist primarily of back office system spend, the start of our CBRS small cell construction and some additional store build-out. We will continue to update you on our capital spending expectations as the year progresses. And as always, if we find new core cable, rural or mobile projects with attractive ROIs, we\u2019ll pursue them even if that means spending capital above our stated outlook. As Slide 12 shows, we generated nearly $2.3 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of about $200 million or 10% year-over-year. We finished the third quarter with $91.2 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in January is $4.2 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.39 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $5.3 billion at an average price of $702 per share. For the full year 2021, we purchased 25.3 million shares at an average price of $683 per share for a total spend of $17.3 billion. And between September of 2016 and December of 2021, we have repurchased $56.8 billion or about 40% of Charter\u2019s equity at an average price of $452 per share. Turning briefly to taxes. We expect to become a meaningful cash taxpayer in 2022. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 through 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to be approximately equal to our consolidated EBITDA less capital expenditures and cash interest expense multiplied by 23% to 25%. We expect the cash tax rate in 2022 to be in the mid-to-high teens range \u2013 percentage range, given some of our tax attributes that have carried over from 2021. Those estimates would include partnership tax distributions to advance new house that are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple pull factors that impact what I just described, and we\u2019re always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile. So, we\u2019re looking forward to the rest of 2022 as we remain well positioned to succeed and grow given strong demand for our products, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network remains state of the art. Our well-proven strategy, which offers customers the highest quality products at very attractive prices drives customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. I guess two questions. First, any update on momentum in the broadband marketplace and how you feel the market is trending in terms of the competitive environment versus the market-related slowdown that you guys have been highlighting? And then secondly, just sort of structurally as you sit back and think about your wireless strategy, obviously, a lot of success in the fourth quarter. And Tom, you talked about wireless a lot in your prepared remarks. I think there\u2019s sort of two dynamics that your big wireless competitors would know. One is owners\u2019 economics across wireless and wireline for two of your competitors. And then secondly, how do you manage wireless customers when it\u2019s time for them to get a new phone when the wireless companies are waving a free new iPhone under their noses? Thank you so much.\nChris Winfrey: Doug, this is Chris. And we anticipated your question, and I have a few thoughts. But just put it in perspective. So, we added over 1.2 million Internet customers last year. And over the last two years, we\u2019ve added nearly 3.5 million. And the rate of market activity and net additions growth has not been consistent through the pandemic with early on or 60-day offers, Keep Americans Connected, resulting payment plans, and more recently, subsidy plans. And we have the lowest market churn rate of all types that any of us have seen in cable. So that lower market churn has resulted in lower selling opportunities, which Jessica mentioned, with lower connects. And as a share gainer, that results in lower net adds. And our financial results, they actually demonstrate fully that lower transaction volume. So clearly, there was a pull forward of demand in 2020 due to the pandemic. But the lower customer activity environment we saw throughout 2021, including the fourth quarter, is being driven by a number of factors. That includes lower household move rates and housing completion rates, it includes lower voluntary churn everywhere we operate and much lower non-pay churn given the amount of subsidy programs that have been and remain available. And so those lower churn rates across each type of churn, they\u2019ve been uniformly lower relative to 2019 and even compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 across every region and every competitive footprint. So as a result, our sales and connect activity have also been muted by similar amounts in each part of the geographical and competitive footprint. In the fourth quarter, we continued to grow customer relationships across our footprint regardless of competitive technology or infrastructure. November activity levels were better than October, December was better than November. And then Omicron provided a setback to transaction volume in late December. So, we had good growth in operating and financial results last year. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll have a steady return to more normal transaction volume and selling opportunities as 2022 progresses and we get further into the year.\nTom Rutledge: And Doug, with regard to wireless competitive dynamics, I think that our pricing structure and the monthly recurring fee piece of the pricing value equation is superior net-net to what our competitors are offering. And we\u2019re getting some traction with that. And of course, that\u2019s combined too with our superior broadband product and the continued investment we make in our broadband product in terms of its capabilities and how we make the wireless product work with our wireline product through the mobile speed boost technology opportunities and other technology opportunities that we have all affect the price value relationship that we\u2019re presenting to the customer. But it\u2019s true that replacement phones are being given away in the marketing strategies of our competitors, and we haven\u2019t done that. And I think customers will have to \u2013 they\u2019re currently making the evaluation that we have a good product, and they\u2019re buying our product. But I think it\u2019s really our challenges to make sure that the customers\u2019 perception of value is appropriate, and that\u2019s our marketing and branding strategy. But if we need to change our competitive posture, we can. I don\u2019t see \u2013 I think what we\u2019re doing right now is the best strategy for us, but it doesn\u2019t preclude us from future strategies. But the fundamental value proposition that we\u2019re providing is superior service, a fully packaged communication service everywhere we operate, which none of our competitors do and making that a better value and driving customer relationships by having better products and services. And the deeper we penetrate, the lower our costs. And the lower our costs, the better the value we can provide.\nDoug Mitchelson: Understood. Thank you both.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Doug. April, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two questions. First, Tom, the \u2013 27% of the total connectivity market today. Taking a sort of a very long-term view, if we look at the market in its end state, what do you think your fair share of that total revenue opportunity is? And what are the margins for an integrated infrastructure asset look like when we get to that end state? And then looking more near term, there\u2019s been a lot of investor concern recently around the impact to future ARPU from some of the competitive entry that we\u2019ve seen from fiber a bit more so from fixed wireless broadband. Can you give us just some insight into what you\u2019re seeing around pricing dynamics in new fiber build markets? And then how you think about Verizon offering a $30 product over wireless? Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: Well, I \u2013 my point of showing the 27% share was that we have a lot of runway and that there\u2019s a huge opportunity for us to grow our business, both horizontally and vertically. And what I mean by horizontally and vertically is, I think we can have more customers that\u2019s horizontal. And I think we can have higher revenue because we have more product being sold even though those unit prices are going to be lower in the future than they are today. What does a converged network look like in the future? I think, we continue to enhance the experience on the mobile device where it\u2019s used the most first and continue to enhance that value by using our superior WiFi network in the new WiFi 6E spectrum available to us and our ability to provide better managed WiFi services through technological change, along with the use of other Spectrum like CBRS to smart capitally efficient way apply technological solutions that reduce cost to us and improve service to the customer. And by doing that, you get a very virtuous product development cycle in that you get better and better services available at lower and lower costs. And so I think we can do that by using our network and using the tools available to us, both in unlicensed and licensed Spectrum and the technology management tools that we can use to manage the experience on those mobile devices as well as all the other devices that are connected to our network. And I think that when you think about mobility and wireless, those two notions somewhat from a technology point of view are converging as well. And most wireless devices are connected to our network. And so I think we can continue to build value and build share using the mobile marketplace as a sort of fuel for that. Do you want to?\nChris Winfrey: The second question, I\u2019ll start, and then others can chime in. The question was regarding ARPU pressure in competitive markets. And Jonathan, you know that over the years, our strategy has always been about providing high-quality service at an attractive price in the marketplace, first and foremost, so that we could grow faster. And that\u2019s always worked for us. But secondly, it makes our markets less attractive from an overbuild situation and puts us in a different position today as we sit in our markets with very competitive prices already on the entire base. So that\u2019s how we think about our positioning in the marketplace. It hasn\u2019t changed. We have a retail strategy and standard pricing across our entire footprint. We react competitively as needed in the marketplace, but we already have attractive prices. We have great service. And we have a product combination that Tom was just talking about that our competitors can\u2019t replicate in all of our passings, which is the ability to extend that good broadband service that we have, together with an integrated mobile and converged Internet product over time. And we have the ability to upgrade our network at a faster pace and lower cost than any of our competitors across all of our passings, not just cherry picking where we think it\u2019s most attractive demographically. That\u2019s how we think about the marketplace in the past. And I know others have always said the investment community, should you take rates up? That hasn\u2019t been our strategy. Our strategy actually works very well in this type of marketplace as well.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, so funded \u2013 what that all means is that we have fundamentally a lower cost structure than our competitors and where our capital investment strategy is designed to maintain that capability, which we think ultimately gives us a better competitive posture. So, we can grow and have better products working at lower costs than can be replicated by our competitors. Anybody can spend enough capital and replicate your service, obviously. But we can do it more efficiently, which is, I think, our competitive opportunity. The other thing I would say just about the current environment is that from a competitive point of view, when we look at our churn, our move churn is down. Our non-pay churn is down, and our voluntary churn is down to historic levels. So, our actual ability to operate in the environment is pretty effective.\nChris Winfrey: And what Tom said is, what I said as well earlier is that\u2019s across all competitive footprints, all geographies. Jonathan, you asked this other question about fixed wireless broadband. I know you\u2019ve written on it in the past, and we agree with you that the utilization of scarce resources and Spectrum or somebody else\u2019s densification to get a one out of 50 type return on the utilization of your asset, which is what happens with fixed wireless broadband applications versus mobility, we agree with that. You\u2019ve written about it. I know Craig wrote about it a couple of weeks ago in a pretty concise way. And there wasn\u2019t anything in there that we actually disagreed with. And you\u2019ve made the point yourself previously, and we think that\u2019s right. And we think that\u2019s going to become pretty evident to most everybody over time.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. April, we\u2019ll take our next question.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. First, a question on the network and high splits. I think, Tom, you said \u2013 I think it was Tom talked about spending some capital on that this year. I think that\u2019s inside of the $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. So just maybe you could help us with kind of sizing that investment, either qualitatively or quantitatively? And sort of how much of the footprint do you expect to impact with that technology deployment, and what it does competitively or from a product point of view? And then I just want to come back to wireless. I know you guys have been working hard to put the pieces in place to sort of be more aggressive in the marketplace. Are we there now? Or is there more as you look into 2022 that you\u2019re going to do on the wireless side, whether it\u2019s billing system-related or sales channel-related or something else that can offer an opportunity to even further accelerate what obviously has been a pretty impressive acceleration over the last few quarters.\nTom Rutledge: Well, on the high split, I\u2019ll say this that we\u2019re deploying the technology. And I said in my prepared remarks that we can go to symmetrical speeds, gigabit speeds. We can go to multi-gig downspeed \u2013 downstream speeds. And as I said earlier, we\u2019re holding our own competitively as it is. And the value of the high split is that by putting \u2013 by re-architecting the network that way, which is basically just an electronic drop in, we can quit spending money on augmentation or node splits at the same rate that we\u2019ve been spending. And so I think the best way to think about it is that depending on speed of construction and on a relative basis, yes, it\u2019s in the $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. And the general capital intensity over a multiyear period associated with that kind of upgrade will maintain the kind of capital intensity that we heretofore had. With regard to wireless billing, the wireless billing opportunity is that we\u2019ve just built a new billing system, and it\u2019s just being deployed. It was deployed in the \u2013 to some extent at the end of the fourth quarter, but not the full fourth quarter. And it gives us new opportunities for selling and making the selling process easier. When we initially launched mobile, we launched it on a platform, both us and Comcast together through our JV launched on a common platform that was segregated from the traditional cable platform. And so it \u2013 obviously, we did well with it. But we\u2019ve rearchitected all of that and deployed a brand-new system that gets us better integrated sales capabilities and better integrated billing capabilities that ultimately makes the sales process easier, our ability to go faster with less friction is enhanced by those capabilities. And so we\u2019re optimistic that we can continue to accelerate our growth there.\nChris Winfrey: You asked about other developments. The deeper deployment of our advanced in-home WiFi, which includes giving customers more control over their WiFi in the home, the deeper deployment of that across our base as well as more functionality that will be applied there. Tom mentioned as well the mobile speed boost as well as a way to enhance the value of this converged offer that we have. So there\u2019s a number of product development pieces that are in the pipeline that are going to continue to add value. Obviously, the CBRS test this year, which Tom also mentioned, that\u2019s a market rollout. But that\u2019s not going to be across our entire footprint just yet. So, I wouldn\u2019t hang too much on that just for 2022. But there\u2019s a lot of development that\u2019s in the pipeline to continue to make this product better than our competitors and more integrated.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: All right, thanks Ben. April, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Yes. Hi, guys. A couple of questions, staying with wireless for a minute. First, can you just talk about the wireless sale? That is, are you primarily selling at the time that people move, and they\u2019re establishing a relationship with Charter for broadband and other services, and you\u2019re selling that as a bundle? Or are you selling into existing broadband subscribers? And then second, as I think about the offload that you\u2019ve already achieved, can you just talk about the kind of margins that you think you can get to in this business? And how much traffic you think you\u2019ll be able to fully offload so that relative to a traditional wireless customer at one of the three majors, how much lower you think the cellular usage for your customers might be relative to those competitors as a benchmark?\nTom Rutledge: Okay. In terms of moving and upgrading, the \u2013 we\u2019re in a low churn environment, so the yield on that segment of moves and people who are in a moment where they\u2019re more likely to be changing services is lower. We\u2019ve actually had \u2013 we\u2019ve achieved additional sell-in using mobile as part of that process. But the bulk of our mobile growth is still coming from upgrades at the moment if you just look at net changes in the broadband versus net changes in mobile. But \u2013 and interestingly, the mix is changing too to more multiline and because of the way we\u2019ve priced it and the value proposition more \u2013 and more full unlimited service. I expect that through time, we\u2019ll get more pull-through on the new customer creation side of it. But just when you do the math in terms of where the opportunity is to grow mobile, given our existing broadband penetration, the \u2013 just mathematically, we have more upside in upgrades. But it has both effects. In terms of offload and margins, I\u2019ve said previously that we could do more than 30% of the offload, I think, through CBRS. We also are already offloading enormous amounts of traffic on WiFi. And I think that we have the ability to take that up significantly, too. So, I\u2019m not going to give you a full number, but it\u2019s substantial.\nJessica Fischer: And I guess the piece that I would add to that is that we have margin that we\u2019re generating from our mobile customers today. So, you have negative EBITDA in the mobile business, but that\u2019s driven really by customer acquisition costs and our rate of growth in the business. We\u2019re generating margin from those customers today, and we can do the CBRS deployment on \u2013 in a very targeted manner. So, we can look at the CBRS deployment targeted on a \u2013 in an ROI-generating fashion. So that every radio we deploy really increases the margin and increases the value of the mobile business. So, I think that, that piece is important as you think about how we grow profitability in that business that we will grow profitability by adding CBRS and by growing the offload. But those customers stand-alone are generating margin today.\nTom Rutledge: Go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: I was just \u2013 do you think this could be sort of a 10% margin business long term, a 20% margin business? It\u2019s a small part. How profitable might it be?\nJessica Fischer: I like to try. We\u2019re not going to go there on guidance for margin in the long-term. But I do think that it\u2019s an important part of thinking about the growth story for EBITDA in the long-term and that as we find those opportunities to increase the margin through deploying capital through CBRS or by sort of upgrading the way that the system offloads traffic overall that we\u2019ll continue to do those things.\nTom Rutledge: I would just say we don\u2019t have to do CBRS to make mobile work.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. Agreed.\nTom Rutledge: And margins will improve regardless.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. April, we\u2019ll take our next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a follow-up on that. Jessica, you talked about how you could be very targeted with the CBRS deployment. Just wanted to follow-up, could you talk a bit about the coverage requirements you have with the CBRS licenses? I understand the goal is to move traffic onto your network, where there\u2019s high traffic density. But I guess I\u2019m just trying to understand what you\u2019re required to do from a coverage perspective and how that might impact the breadth of the deployment. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. So, I\u2019ll take that. We do have across the regions that we acquired the Spectrum, some minimal amount of deployment across those areas. It doesn\u2019t have to be deep, and it doesn\u2019t have to be expensive from a deployment standpoint. It\u2019s over a multiyear period. And so in every market where we\u2019ve acquired Spectrum, there\u2019s always going to be extremely high traffic areas. And we feel really comfortable we can satisfy the deployment commitment at a pretty low cost and then go from there in terms of just picking and choosing where it makes sense either from a product capability perspective or from an ROI perspective is what Jessica was saying.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. And when we talk about a full market deployment, we\u2019re talking about a full market deployment where it makes sense. And what that means is, we\u2019re putting these radios where traffic dictates that the radio should be and that the amount of offload would reduce our costs sufficiently to pay back the investment in the radios quickly, yes. And so it\u2019s opportunistic capital, which generates a higher margin on the mobile business.\nBryan Kraft: Thank you. If I could just ask one follow-up. Could you just remind us what the dates are around those license for you to meet coverage milestones, minimal coverage milestones?\nChris Winfrey: Yes, it\u2019s public, and so we\u2019re not \u2013 I\u2019m not hiding it. I just don\u2019t know it off \u2013 I don\u2019t remember it off the top of my head. But it\u2019s a multiyear outlay. If you follow-up with Stefan, he can get you the exact dates because it is public as part of the FCC process.\nBryan Kraft: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nStefan Anninger: April, we\u2019ll take our next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thank you. A couple of \u2013 actually one follow-up. You commented on the pace of broadband through the fourth quarter, and I know there was \u2013 I think there was a New York runoff there as well. But I\u2019m curious how you think about seasonality versus typical. Is seasonality sort of running in the business these days? Or is the sort of underlying engine just running more normal through the year? And then second, on SMB, that decelerated this quarter. Maybe you can talk about any update on efforts there as well as conversations with enterprises, what are you seeing? Thanks very much.\nJessica Fischer: Phil, I\u2019ll pick up on two of those. First just around seasonality. I mean, certainly, our results looked different over the course of this year than you would see from a seasonality perspective over a normal year. And one of the things that we\u2019ve been thinking about that we see a lower number of college student enrollments. And so some of those markets have looked sort of different from what we would normally expect. And the overall environment does appear to be sort of more impacted, as Chris mentioned, by things like COVID waves and seeing lower activity when something like Omicron happens. We also did see some impacts from other things on the New York State side, New York had a moratorium on certain disconnects. It did drive a onetime spike in Internet non-pay disconnects. It was about 20,000 in the quarter. So, if you head back that out, we would have been at 210,000 rather than 190,000 but not a huge impact in terms of the overall net adds for the year, which we still thought were very good if they were dispersed a little less evenly.\nTom Rutledge: And I guess to speak to seasonality. Video was very seasonal. In the fall season, you had a tremendous uptick. Fourth quarter was big, although Cablevision because of the Hampton has a sort of an opposite effect. But fourth quarter is a big issue in video, not \u2013 but as Jessica said, the college student situation has been unusual lately. And wireless has its own cadence too, which I\u2019m not sure we fully grasp yet, although we have people who think they do. And whether there\u2019s an underlying broadband seasonality, it\u2019s hard to say. So, I do think that the traditional seasonality in the business is going to be different. And obviously, the effects of COVID have been dramatic in terms of quarter-to-quarter changes in growth. Even in the last quarter, it was very interesting in that the activity levels had \u2013 we\u2019re at \u2013 hit their lowest level in both October, and they started \u2013 November was better than October, and December was better than November. And Omicron affected us at the end of December. So it\u2019s hard to say whether that trend will continue, but my guess is it will steadily improve.\nChris Winfrey: There was a second question on enterprise. I didn\u2019t catch that. Was that also tied to seasonality?\nPhil Cusick: And SMB. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: In terms of seasonality there with those businesses? Enterprise has been from a retail perspective...\nPhil Cusick: I thought \u2013 SMB was down sequentially. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. The SMB business is doing very well. I know relative to last year, it may not look quite as much. But last year, you had an SMB surge coming out of really the lockdown tied to COVID. So the year-over-year comparison there is less favorable. But the underlying trends that we\u2019re seeing coming out of Q4 in the SMB despite everything that COVID has brought, SMB\u2019s continuing to do well and steady. Despite everything that would suggest there might be some pressure there, we\u2019re performing well in SMB. On the enterprise side, there are markets that are still coming back underperforming, New York City and L.A., in particular. But despite that, if you take a look at the underlying retail PSU growth and revenue growth, we\u2019re on a steady march to sequentially improving over many, many quarters now. And that business is looking more healthy. And once we get back into a normal environment, there won\u2019t be that much seasonality tied to enterprise as it will continue to get better is our hope.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks guys.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. April, we\u2019ll take our next question please?\nOperator: Your next question is from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to \u2013 something now that you\u2019re going to start seeing some RDOF CapEx really come through. Can you sort of remind us \u2013 and actually, Jessica, you mentioned looks like as though you did another cable acquisition, can you sort of remind us sort of what are the sort of levered or unlevered IRRs you think you can get, especially in sort of a divergent opportunity there? Obviously, it will be an impact on total company free cash, but it\u2019s probably a fantastic project. Can you just help us think through the long-term returns on that investment?\nJessica Fischer: Sure. So, I would point out that you used the word long-term. And I do think that we think of the investment in RDOF really as a long-term investment in terms of creating returns. But based on the kind of markets that those were in and the success really that we saw in the New York State build-out, we think that we can generate mid-teen IRRs in the long-term from building those passings. And from a project perspective, I\u2019d also point out that a lot of that has already started and has to be. The spend there will be a little lumpy. So you have to spend money upfront to do things like go \u2013 do walkouts and figure out where \u2013 and figure out how to attach to the polls and design your construction, and that all takes time. So what you\u2019re going to see is you\u2019ll see sort of cash investment going in upfront, that\u2019s going to happen before we light up the passings and the passings then will sort of trail behind that. And that\u2019s all sort of factored into the way we think about the IRR of the investment, but it will look different from what I think are sort of normal placing in service of passing on a year-to-year basis book line.\nVijay Jayant: If I could another one on this CapEx \u2013 excuse me, taxes. You talked about being a meaningful taxpayer in 2022, and you still have some tax credits and NOL carryforward. Any help on how close to being a full statutory taxpayer you are likely to be in 2022?\nJessica Fischer: Yes. I mean, I think you can look back in the comments in the script, but it\u2019s \u2013 if you take our EBITDA and subtract from that capital expenditures and cash interest for the year and then multiply that by a mid-teens number, you get there. So you can see the credits and the carryforward on the balance sheet. There is some of that carryforward that\u2019s still subject to limitations on our usage going forward. And so based on that, we\u2019ve sort of come through that process to get to what we think is an appropriate rate for 2022.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Vijay. April we\u2019ll take our last question please?\nOperator: Your last question is from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Hi. Thanks guys. Thanks for all the detail on the rural build-out. Can you give us a sense \u2013 I think you guys have been adding about 1 million homes passed a year for the last few years. And does that ramp from here? If you could give us a sense on \u2013 it sounds like it may be the ramp is a little bit slower this year, but what\u2019s a good sort of run rate once you\u2019re \u2013 once all the money is coming in, and you\u2019re getting it out there and sort of executing on that strategy? And then a follow-up on pricing. I think you guys typically take a price increase November, December on the broadband side. And I don\u2019t believe that happened this year. Is that something we could expect early in 2022 here? Or has your view on sort of slow methodical sort of price increases on the broadband side changed? Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: Sure. So I can start on the sort of home passed per year. I think the rate that we are typically add is around 1 million a year. I think the commitment that we\u2019ve made around RDOF build one million additional FCC locations, one million additional passings over the course of five years. I think that if you pace it in that way that you\u2019ll be close, though the caveat that I would add to it that we do continue to be \u2013 to bid on additional subsidized build projects. And in addition to that, we have spaces that we\u2019ll build that are the space between our network today and where the subsidized build projects are or that are in rural areas that aren\u2019t part of those projects that are sort of close to what we passed today. And so in addition to those passings that we\u2019ve committed under RDOF, you might see additional passings. And if we\u2019re really successful in the subsidized build space, you might see even more. But I think that\u2019s a good place to start as you think about what we\u2019ll be able to place in service.\nJohn Hodulik: So just as a clarification, is that \u2013 so is that all incremental to the one million you were doing previously?\nJessica Fischer: It is incremental to the one million.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Great.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. And with regard to broadband rates, our view is that has always been that we think that our total packaged product should be able to drive the bulk of our revenue and EBITDA growth. And we have tried to continue to make our product more valuable so that we sell more customers. And our anticipation is that that\u2019s going to be our continued strategy, and that we\u2019ll be able to grow our business nicely and grow our revenue nicely by combining our mobile products with our wireline products. And so there is no rate increase in broadband planned in the short run.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thanks Tom.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, John. Thanks to everyone. That concludes our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Doug, this is Chris. And we anticipated your question, and I have a few thoughts. But just put it in perspective. So, we added over 1.2 million Internet customers last year. And over the last two years, we've added nearly 3.5 million. And the rate of market activity and net additions growth has not been consistent through the pandemic with early on or 60-day offers, Keep Americans Connected, resulting payment plans, and more recently, subsidy plans. And we have the lowest market churn rate of all types that any of us have seen in cable. So that lower market churn has resulted in lower selling opportunities, which Jessica mentioned, with lower connects. And as a share gainer, that results in lower net adds. And our financial results, they actually demonstrate fully that lower transaction volume. So clearly, there was a pull forward of demand in 2020 due to the pandemic. But the lower customer activity environment we saw throughout 2021, including the fourth quarter, is being driven by a number of factors. That includes lower household move rates and housing completion rates, it includes lower voluntary churn everywhere we operate and much lower non-pay churn given the amount of subsidy programs that have been and remain available. And so those lower churn rates across each type of churn, they've been uniformly lower relative to 2019 and even compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 across every region and every competitive footprint. So as a result, our sales and connect activity have also been muted by similar amounts in each part of the geographical and competitive footprint. In the fourth quarter, we continued to grow customer relationships across our footprint regardless of competitive technology or infrastructure. November activity levels were better than October, December was better than November. And then Omicron provided a setback to transaction volume in late December. So, we had good growth in operating and financial results last year. And our expectation is that we'll have a steady return to more normal transaction volume and selling opportunities as 2022 progresses and we get further into the year. The second question, I'll start, and then others can chime in. The question was regarding ARPU pressure in competitive markets. And Jonathan, you know that over the years, our strategy has always been about providing high-quality service at an attractive price in the marketplace, first and foremost, so that we could grow faster. And that's always worked for us. But secondly, it makes our markets less attractive from an overbuild situation and puts us in a different position today as we sit in our markets with very competitive prices already on the entire base. So that's how we think about our positioning in the marketplace. It hasn't changed. We have a retail strategy and standard pricing across our entire footprint. We react competitively as needed in the marketplace, but we already have attractive prices. We have great service. And we have a product combination that Tom was just talking about that our competitors can't replicate in all of our passings, which is the ability to extend that good broadband service that we have, together with an integrated mobile and converged Internet product over time. And we have the ability to upgrade our network at a faster pace and lower cost than any of our competitors across all of our passings, not just cherry picking where we think it's most attractive demographically. That's how we think about the marketplace in the past. And I know others have always said the investment community, should you take rates up? That hasn't been our strategy. Our strategy actually works very well in this type of marketplace as well. And what Tom said is, what I said as well earlier is that's across all competitive footprints, all geographies. Jonathan, you asked this other question about fixed wireless broadband. I know you've written on it in the past, and we agree with you that the utilization of scarce resources and Spectrum or somebody else's densification to get a one out of 50 type return on the utilization of your asset, which is what happens with fixed wireless broadband applications versus mobility, we agree with that. You've written about it. I know Craig wrote about it a couple of weeks ago in a pretty concise way. And there wasn't anything in there that we actually disagreed with. And you've made the point yourself previously, and we think that's right. And we think that's going to become pretty evident to most everybody over time. You asked about other developments. The deeper deployment of our advanced in-home WiFi, which includes giving customers more control over their WiFi in the home, the deeper deployment of that across our base as well as more functionality that will be applied there. Tom mentioned as well the mobile speed boost as well as a way to enhance the value of this converged offer that we have. So there's a number of product development pieces that are in the pipeline that are going to continue to add value. Obviously, the CBRS test this year, which Tom also mentioned, that's a market rollout. But that's not going to be across our entire footprint just yet. So, I wouldn't hang too much on that just for 2022. But there's a lot of development that's in the pipeline to continue to make this product better than our competitors and more integrated. Yes. So, I'll take that. We do have across the regions that we acquired the Spectrum, some minimal amount of deployment across those areas. It doesn't have to be deep, and it doesn't have to be expensive from a deployment standpoint. It's over a multiyear period. And so in every market where we've acquired Spectrum, there's always going to be extremely high traffic areas. And we feel really comfortable we can satisfy the deployment commitment at a pretty low cost and then go from there in terms of just picking and choosing where it makes sense either from a product capability perspective or from an ROI perspective is what Jessica was saying. Yes, it's public, and so we're not \u2013 I'm not hiding it. I just don't know it off \u2013 I don't remember it off the top of my head. But it's a multiyear outlay. If you follow-up with Stefan, he can get you the exact dates because it is public as part of the FCC process. There was a second question on enterprise. I didn't catch that. Was that also tied to seasonality? In terms of seasonality there with those businesses? Enterprise has been from a retail perspective... Yes. The SMB business is doing very well. I know relative to last year, it may not look quite as much. But last year, you had an SMB surge coming out of really the lockdown tied to COVID. So the year-over-year comparison there is less favorable. But the underlying trends that we're seeing coming out of Q4 in the SMB despite everything that COVID has brought, SMB's continuing to do well and steady. Despite everything that would suggest there might be some pressure there, we're performing well in SMB. On the enterprise side, there are markets that are still coming back underperforming, New York City and L.A., in particular. But despite that, if you take a look at the underlying retail PSU growth and revenue growth, we're on a steady march to sequentially improving over many, many quarters now. And that business is looking more healthy. And once we get back into a normal environment, there won't be that much seasonality tied to enterprise as it will continue to get better is our hope."

            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the fourth quarter with solid customer growth and strong financial growth. In October, we launched our new Spectrum Mobile multiline pricing and packaging, which allows Spectrum Mobile customers to save hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year on their personal communication spend. We had our strongest mobile quarter ever with 380,000 line net adds. For the full year 2021, we added 940,000 new customer relationships, and we added over 1.2 million Internet customers for growth of over 4%. We also grew our mobile lines by 1.2 million. Financials were also strong in 2021. We grew full year revenue and EBITDA by 7.5% and 11.4%, respectively, and free cash flow grew by 23% year-over-year to $8.7 billion. As we look forward to the rest of this year, we remain focused on several strategic priorities and goals, including product development and network evolution, our rural construction initiative and driving customer growth and penetration. And although the business environment in which we're operating remains unusual, we believe our goals and priorities will continue to foster our growth and prepare us well when the marketplace returns to historical levels of marketplace activity and sales. Fundamental to our success is the delivery of products and services that are superior to what our competitors can offer. Delivering more speed and throughput to our customers remains a key area of focus. In December, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And nearly 25% of our non-video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. So we continue to see very high demand for throughput by our customers. In order to increase the capacity of our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multi-faceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies, which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. In 2022, we'll increase the number of projects to deploy high splits in our service areas. High splits are powerful, cost-efficient upgrades that use our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure and allow us to comfortably offer gigabit speeds at symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Additionally, high splits will significantly reduce our network augmentation capital spending, including node spending. We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 technology, plant architecture and rollout, which will allow us to cost efficiently offer higher multi-gigabit speeds in the future. We recently ran a DOCSIS 4.0 test using Frequency Division Duplexing, and we successfully delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream, and there's more to come from that technology. Other areas of product development in 2022 include speed boosting our WiFi connections, while Spectrum Mobile customers are on their Spectrum Mobile devices connected to any Spectrum WiFi access point enabled for mobile service. We also just turned on 5G C-band for all Spectrum Mobile customers who have a C-band enabled device, which means they can get faster 5G speeds while on the go. Both of the speed boosting enhancements I just mentioned are included in our mobile pricing at no extra charge. We're also rolling out our 5G hybrid mobile network operation using CBRS small cells in a full market area allowing selected participants to connect to our CBRS small cell access points when they're outside of WiFi coverage. By furthering the convergence of our fixed and mobile broadband service, we not only improve the economics of our mobile business but improve the customer experience. In fact, for the last 10 quarters, Global Wireless Solutions has ranked our mobile service the fastest in the country because we combine our Internet and mobile connectivity together with our state-of-the-art WiFi service. Another key piece of our long-term strategy is treating customer service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their Spectrum services and interactions with us whenever and however they want. We continue to work on improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing and monetizing a number of elements of our customer, field and network operations groups. Our rural construction initiative also remains a key focus. Our multiyear, multibillion-dollar construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country. Through the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, or RDOF, we will add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next five years. We're also in the midst of hiring more than 2,000 employees and contractors to support our rural expansion. But our rural construction initiative is not limited to RDOF commitments. We'll continue to build in other rural areas as well, and we will pursue opportunities to receive broadband stimulus funds, including the American Rescue Plan Act funds and funds from Infrastructure Investment Act and Jobs Act. We'll also extend our network passed homes in areas adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not currently reach today. Ultimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but it's also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns. Finally, as we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on driving customer growth, market share growth and penetration by offering high-quality products and services at attractive prices. Our network allows us to deliver a unique, fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds of thousands of dollars per year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, Slide 4 in the presentation shows we only capture about 27% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase the market share with superior products, saving customers money and through our latest offering, we can do that. An average household mobile broadband spend with two lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband is approximately $200 a month. With our new multiline pricing and packaging launched in October, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and two lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less and save at least $700 a year. So far, we've seen a very strong response to our offering with our fourth quarter being our strongest quarter for mobile lines net adds yet. In fact, despite a very competitive environment, we continue to gain lines at a very rapid pace because of the value in our bundled service offering, which drives more EBITDA and free cash flow per customer and per passing value for shareholders. Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica. And Doug, with regard to wireless competitive dynamics, I think that our pricing structure and the monthly recurring fee piece of the pricing value equation is superior net-net to what our competitors are offering. And we're getting some traction with that. And of course, that's combined too with our superior broadband product and the continued investment we make in our broadband product in terms of its capabilities and how we make the wireless product work with our wireline product through the mobile speed boost technology opportunities and other technology opportunities that we have all affect the price value relationship that we're presenting to the customer. But it's true that replacement phones are being given away in the marketing strategies of our competitors, and we haven't done that. And I think customers will have to \u2013 they're currently making the evaluation that we have a good product, and they're buying our product. But I think it's really our challenges to make sure that the customers' perception of value is appropriate, and that's our marketing and branding strategy. But if we need to change our competitive posture, we can. I don't see \u2013 I think what we're doing right now is the best strategy for us, but it doesn't preclude us from future strategies. But the fundamental value proposition that we're providing is superior service, a fully packaged communication service everywhere we operate, which none of our competitors do and making that a better value and driving customer relationships by having better products and services. And the deeper we penetrate, the lower our costs. And the lower our costs, the better the value we can provide. Well, I \u2013 my point of showing the 27% share was that we have a lot of runway and that there's a huge opportunity for us to grow our business, both horizontally and vertically. And what I mean by horizontally and vertically is, I think we can have more customers that's horizontal. And I think we can have higher revenue because we have more product being sold even though those unit prices are going to be lower in the future than they are today. What does a converged network look like in the future? I think, we continue to enhance the experience on the mobile device where it's used the most first and continue to enhance that value by using our superior WiFi network in the new WiFi 6E spectrum available to us and our ability to provide better managed WiFi services through technological change, along with the use of other Spectrum like CBRS to smart capitally efficient way apply technological solutions that reduce cost to us and improve service to the customer. And by doing that, you get a very virtuous product development cycle in that you get better and better services available at lower and lower costs. And so I think we can do that by using our network and using the tools available to us, both in unlicensed and licensed Spectrum and the technology management tools that we can use to manage the experience on those mobile devices as well as all the other devices that are connected to our network. And I think that when you think about mobility and wireless, those two notions somewhat from a technology point of view are converging as well. And most wireless devices are connected to our network. And so I think we can continue to build value and build share using the mobile marketplace as a sort of fuel for that. Do you want to? Yes. The only thing I would add to that is, so funded \u2013 what that all means is that we have fundamentally a lower cost structure than our competitors and where our capital investment strategy is designed to maintain that capability, which we think ultimately gives us a better competitive posture. So, we can grow and have better products working at lower costs than can be replicated by our competitors. Anybody can spend enough capital and replicate your service, obviously. But we can do it more efficiently, which is, I think, our competitive opportunity. The other thing I would say just about the current environment is that from a competitive point of view, when we look at our churn, our move churn is down. Our non-pay churn is down, and our voluntary churn is down to historic levels. So, our actual ability to operate in the environment is pretty effective. Well, on the high split, I'll say this that we're deploying the technology. And I said in my prepared remarks that we can go to symmetrical speeds, gigabit speeds. We can go to multi-gig downspeed \u2013 downstream speeds. And as I said earlier, we're holding our own competitively as it is. And the value of the high split is that by putting \u2013 by re-architecting the network that way, which is basically just an electronic drop in, we can quit spending money on augmentation or node splits at the same rate that we've been spending. And so I think the best way to think about it is that depending on speed of construction and on a relative basis, yes, it's in the $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. And the general capital intensity over a multiyear period associated with that kind of upgrade will maintain the kind of capital intensity that we heretofore had. With regard to wireless billing, the wireless billing opportunity is that we've just built a new billing system, and it's just being deployed. It was deployed in the \u2013 to some extent at the end of the fourth quarter, but not the full fourth quarter. And it gives us new opportunities for selling and making the selling process easier. When we initially launched mobile, we launched it on a platform, both us and Comcast together through our JV launched on a common platform that was segregated from the traditional cable platform. And so it \u2013 obviously, we did well with it. But we've rearchitected all of that and deployed a brand-new system that gets us better integrated sales capabilities and better integrated billing capabilities that ultimately makes the sales process easier, our ability to go faster with less friction is enhanced by those capabilities. And so we're optimistic that we can continue to accelerate our growth there. Okay. In terms of moving and upgrading, the \u2013 we're in a low churn environment, so the yield on that segment of moves and people who are in a moment where they're more likely to be changing services is lower. We've actually had \u2013 we've achieved additional sell-in using mobile as part of that process. But the bulk of our mobile growth is still coming from upgrades at the moment if you just look at net changes in the broadband versus net changes in mobile. But \u2013 and interestingly, the mix is changing too to more multiline and because of the way we've priced it and the value proposition more \u2013 and more full unlimited service. I expect that through time, we'll get more pull-through on the new customer creation side of it. But just when you do the math in terms of where the opportunity is to grow mobile, given our existing broadband penetration, the \u2013 just mathematically, we have more upside in upgrades. But it has both effects. In terms of offload and margins, I've said previously that we could do more than 30% of the offload, I think, through CBRS. We also are already offloading enormous amounts of traffic on WiFi. And I think that we have the ability to take that up significantly, too. So, I'm not going to give you a full number, but it's substantial. Go ahead. I would just say we don't have to do CBRS to make mobile work. And margins will improve regardless. Yes. And when we talk about a full market deployment, we're talking about a full market deployment where it makes sense. And what that means is, we're putting these radios where traffic dictates that the radio should be and that the amount of offload would reduce our costs sufficiently to pay back the investment in the radios quickly, yes. And so it's opportunistic capital, which generates a higher margin on the mobile business. And I guess to speak to seasonality. Video was very seasonal. In the fall season, you had a tremendous uptick. Fourth quarter was big, although Cablevision because of the Hampton has a sort of an opposite effect. But fourth quarter is a big issue in video, not \u2013 but as Jessica said, the college student situation has been unusual lately. And wireless has its own cadence too, which I'm not sure we fully grasp yet, although we have people who think they do. And whether there's an underlying broadband seasonality, it's hard to say. So, I do think that the traditional seasonality in the business is going to be different. And obviously, the effects of COVID have been dramatic in terms of quarter-to-quarter changes in growth. Even in the last quarter, it was very interesting in that the activity levels had \u2013 we're at \u2013 hit their lowest level in both October, and they started \u2013 November was better than October, and December was better than November. And Omicron affected us at the end of December. So it's hard to say whether that trend will continue, but my guess is it will steadily improve. Yes. And with regard to broadband rates, our view is that has always been that we think that our total packaged product should be able to drive the bulk of our revenue and EBITDA growth. And we have tried to continue to make our product more valuable so that we sell more customers. And our anticipation is that that's going to be our continued strategy, and that we'll be able to grow our business nicely and grow our revenue nicely by combining our mobile products with our wireline products. And so there is no rate increase in broadband planned in the short run."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's turn to our customer results on Slides 6 and 7. Please note that we will continue to reference COVID-19-related financial impacts from 2020 and included again on Slides 19 and 20 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 120,000 in the fourth quarter and by 939,000 in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 190,000 in the quarter and by 1.2 million or 4.2% over the last 12 months. Although our Internet customer growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, the business environment in which we are operating has not yet normalized. Similar to the third quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 58,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 154,000, and we added 380,000 mobile lines. As of the end of the fourth quarter, we had 3.6 million mobile lines. And despite the lower numbers of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. Moving to the financial results, starting on Slide 8. Over the last year, we grew residential customers by 847,000 or 2.9%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups, video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases and $22 million of COVID-related impacts in the prior period. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends that we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Additionally, this quarter includes $31 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video customers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 8 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.1% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and ARPU growth. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 5.8%. This growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $8 million that negatively impacted the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.9%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%. And enterprise PSUs grew by 5.3% year-over-year, a bit faster than last quarter. Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 28.2% year-over-year primarily due to strong political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, partly offset by COVID impacts last year. When compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, advertising revenue increased by 3.3% primarily due to our growth in advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by local \u2013 lower local ad revenue, particularly automotive. If you exclude automotive, fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 13.3% over the fourth quarter of 2019. Mobile revenue totaled $632 million with $266 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 6.2% year-over-year driven by lower levels of CPE sold to customers. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 4.7% year-over-year. And when excluding advertising, which benefited from political revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020, revenue grew by 6.4%. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 9. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $203 million or 2.7% year-over-year. Programming costs decreased by 0.5% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 2.3%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $31 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned earlier and $19 million of other favorable adjustments, all of which was partially offset by the high \u2013 by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.2%. Looking at the full year 2022, we expect programming costs per video customer to grow in the mid-single digit percentage range. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 11.3% primarily driven by higher Lakers RSN costs, partially offset by lower original programming costs and regulatory and franchise fees. The Lakers cost growth was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove fewer Lakers games charges in Q4 of 2020, making for a challenging comparison to this year. Excluding RSN costs from both years, regulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 3.5%. Cost to service customers declined by 0.5% year-over-year, compared to 3% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs, mostly offset by previously announced wage increases, which will ultimately provide all hourly employees at Charter a starting minimum wage of $20 per hour by the end of the first quarter. Marketing expenses grew by 4.3% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $724 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses declined by 6.5% driven primarily by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year, given the decline in political ad revenue this year and a one-time corporate cost in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 7.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 10. We generated $1.6 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter versus $1.2 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 11. Capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter, in line with last year's fourth quarter spend, although the components of that spend were a bit different. Upgrade and rebuild grew by $66 million year-over-year due to plant replacement in those portions of our footprint that were damaged by Hurricane Ida. Scalable infrastructure spends declined by $45 million, given a stabilized level of network traffic growth and investments made earlier this year. We spent $127 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, cable capital intensity was lower than in 2020 and in line with our outlook. As we look to the full year 2022, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding capital expenditures associated with our rural construction initiative, to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion. We hope to spend about $1 billion in 2022 on capital expenditures related to our rural construction initiative or our construction within census block groups that are defined as rural. That spending includes our RDOF and other subsidized rural construction projects such as ARPU-related bills and spend associated with extending our plant to rural homes adjacent to our subsidized builds that our network does not reach today. We may not reach that targeted spend given a number of factors, including pull permitting and equipment and labor availability. Conversely, we continue to bid on additional broadband stimulus projects that could increase 2022 capital spending for overall construction initiative. Given the variables, our actual rural construction initiative spending may differ meaningfully from our target. As Tom mentioned, the expansion of our footprint into rural areas will help us drive additional customer growth and financial returns. And we view our rural construction initiative as similar to or equivalent to acquiring a rural cable operator. We plan to begin disclosing additional operating information associated with our rural construction initiative in 2022. Turning to mobile. We expect our full year 2022 mobile capital expenditures to be about $100 million less than our full year 2021 mobile capital spend, which totaled $482 million. Our 2022 mobile capital spend will consist primarily of back office system spend, the start of our CBRS small cell construction and some additional store build-out. We will continue to update you on our capital spending expectations as the year progresses. And as always, if we find new core cable, rural or mobile projects with attractive ROIs, we'll pursue them even if that means spending capital above our stated outlook. As Slide 12 shows, we generated nearly $2.3 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of about $200 million or 10% year-over-year. We finished the third quarter with $91.2 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in January is $4.2 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.39 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 7.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $5.3 billion at an average price of $702 per share. For the full year 2021, we purchased 25.3 million shares at an average price of $683 per share for a total spend of $17.3 billion. And between September of 2016 and December of 2021, we have repurchased $56.8 billion or about 40% of Charter's equity at an average price of $452 per share. Turning briefly to taxes. We expect to become a meaningful cash taxpayer in 2022. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 through 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to be approximately equal to our consolidated EBITDA less capital expenditures and cash interest expense multiplied by 23% to 25%. We expect the cash tax rate in 2022 to be in the mid-to-high teens range \u2013 percentage range, given some of our tax attributes that have carried over from 2021. Those estimates would include partnership tax distributions to advance new house that are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple pull factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile. So, we're looking forward to the rest of 2022 as we remain well positioned to succeed and grow given strong demand for our products, which is why we continue to aggressively build out more broadband passings and ensure that our network remains state of the art. Our well-proven strategy, which offers customers the highest quality products at very attractive prices drives customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. And I guess the piece that I would add to that is that we have margin that we're generating from our mobile customers today. So, you have negative EBITDA in the mobile business, but that's driven really by customer acquisition costs and our rate of growth in the business. We're generating margin from those customers today, and we can do the CBRS deployment on \u2013 in a very targeted manner. So, we can look at the CBRS deployment targeted on a \u2013 in an ROI-generating fashion. So that every radio we deploy really increases the margin and increases the value of the mobile business. So, I think that, that piece is important as you think about how we grow profitability in that business that we will grow profitability by adding CBRS and by growing the offload. But those customers stand-alone are generating margin today. I like to try. We're not going to go there on guidance for margin in the long-term. But I do think that it's an important part of thinking about the growth story for EBITDA in the long-term and that as we find those opportunities to increase the margin through deploying capital through CBRS or by sort of upgrading the way that the system offloads traffic overall that we'll continue to do those things. Yes. Agreed. Phil, I'll pick up on two of those. First just around seasonality. I mean, certainly, our results looked different over the course of this year than you would see from a seasonality perspective over a normal year. And one of the things that we've been thinking about that we see a lower number of college student enrollments. And so some of those markets have looked sort of different from what we would normally expect. And the overall environment does appear to be sort of more impacted, as Chris mentioned, by things like COVID waves and seeing lower activity when something like Omicron happens. We also did see some impacts from other things on the New York State side, New York had a moratorium on certain disconnects. It did drive a onetime spike in Internet non-pay disconnects. It was about 20,000 in the quarter. So, if you head back that out, we would have been at 210,000 rather than 190,000 but not a huge impact in terms of the overall net adds for the year, which we still thought were very good if they were dispersed a little less evenly. Sure. So, I would point out that you used the word long-term. And I do think that we think of the investment in RDOF really as a long-term investment in terms of creating returns. But based on the kind of markets that those were in and the success really that we saw in the New York State build-out, we think that we can generate mid-teen IRRs in the long-term from building those passings. And from a project perspective, I'd also point out that a lot of that has already started and has to be. The spend there will be a little lumpy. So you have to spend money upfront to do things like go \u2013 do walkouts and figure out where \u2013 and figure out how to attach to the polls and design your construction, and that all takes time. So what you're going to see is you'll see sort of cash investment going in upfront, that's going to happen before we light up the passings and the passings then will sort of trail behind that. And that's all sort of factored into the way we think about the IRR of the investment, but it will look different from what I think are sort of normal placing in service of passing on a year-to-year basis book line. Yes. I mean, I think you can look back in the comments in the script, but it's \u2013 if you take our EBITDA and subtract from that capital expenditures and cash interest for the year and then multiply that by a mid-teens number, you get there. So you can see the credits and the carryforward on the balance sheet. There is some of that carryforward that's still subject to limitations on our usage going forward. And so based on that, we've sort of come through that process to get to what we think is an appropriate rate for 2022. Sure. So I can start on the sort of home passed per year. I think the rate that we are typically add is around 1 million a year. I think the commitment that we've made around RDOF build one million additional FCC locations, one million additional passings over the course of five years. I think that if you pace it in that way that you'll be close, though the caveat that I would add to it that we do continue to be \u2013 to bid on additional subsidized build projects. And in addition to that, we have spaces that we'll build that are the space between our network today and where the subsidized build projects are or that are in rural areas that aren't part of those projects that are sort of close to what we passed today. And so in addition to those passings that we've committed under RDOF, you might see additional passings. And if we're really successful in the subsidized build space, you might see even more. But I think that's a good place to start as you think about what we'll be able to place in service. It is incremental to the one million."

On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO, Chris Winfrey, our COO, and Jessica Fisher, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Good morning and thank you, Stefan. We performed well in the third quarter, with good customer growth and very strong financial results. However, we're operating in an unusual environment where the market effects of COVID-19 have not yet normalized. Market churn remains historically low such that net gains are being driven by much lower transaction activity. Despite that, for the full quarter, we added 185,000 customer relationships, with customer growth of 3.3% year-over-year. We also added 265,000 Internet customers in the quarter, and 1.3 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 4.4%. We added 244,000 mobile lines and supported by lower churn and a more tenured customer base, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by a strong 13.9% in our quarterly free cash flow by over 700 million year-over-year. Our view is that we have a long and robust runway of customer growth ahead of us. Today, our network passes over 54 million homes and businesses, and we're doing business with approximately 32 million of them, leaving us with over 20 million opportunities to create new customer relationships. There also approximately 120 million mobile broadband lines in our footprint, and we are currently serving 3.2 million of those. We're currently very underpenetrated. We're looking forward -- looking forward, we remain focused on improving both the quality and value of our products as data usage in the home and outside the home continues to increase at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, we launched our new and highly attractive unlimited multiline pricing structure, which allows customers to save even more on their mobile bills. Early next year, we will launch a field trial of our CBRS small cells in a full market area, allowing participants to attach to our CBRS small cell access points when they are outside of Wi - Fi coverage, providing our spectrum mobile customers with even faster speeds, while improving the economics of our mobile business. We also continue to deliver improving wireline connectivity products. Today, over 70% of our Internet customers subscribe to tiers that provide 200 megabits or more of speed. And our new Wi - Fi 6 Routers and Spectrum Wi-Fi pods managed by our advanced home Wi - Fi platform and our -- My Spectrum App. Provide customers with complete home coverage and greater control of their home networks and connected devices. As expected, we continue to see very high demand for data by our customers. During the quarter, non-video Internet customers used over 600 gigabytes per month, stable as of late, but more than 30% higher than pre -pandemic levels. And today, close to 20% of our non-video Internet customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. In order to increase the capacity and speed on our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multifaceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. We continued to expand our capacity by splitting nodes, but we have a cost -effective approach to deliver multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and a gigabit per second -- symmetrical speeds in both downstream and upstream directions, all using our deployed DOCSIS 3.1 platform. And high-splits, which are currently being tested in market, not only allow for increased speeds in the near-term, but are also a capital-efficient way, as they currently use deployed DOCSIS 3.1 customer premises equipment and reduce the need for node splits, which require an average consumer bandwidth utilization, which will require as consumer bandwidth utilization increase. What I'm saying there is that the high-split actually uses the capital that was needed for node splits. We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 [Indiscernible] technology plant architecture, and roll-out, which allows us to cost effectively and cost efficiently offer greater gigabit speeds in both the downstream and upstream. And of course, we're already using fiber-to-the-home technology in a number of use cases across our footprint, including rural areas such as our [Indiscernible] in an MDUs and Greenfield build areas where the economics makes sense. Ultimately, our plant will be comprised of the most bandwidth - rich and cost -effective technologies, enabling us to deliver the fastest speeds in the industry in a more cost-efficient manner than competitors ubiquitously across 24 million passing\u2019s and growing. So with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers penetration, EBITDA, and free cash flow for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Chris, I want to make a few comments about our recently announced management changes and promotions. October 19th, we announced that John Bickham had been appointed Vice Chairman ahead of his previously announced retirement at the end of 2022. I worked with John for 3 decades and at every turn his knowledge, leadership, and steady hand did not only contribute greatly to the success of the Companies we led but made a profound impact on the growth of our industry. I'm grateful that John will continue to serve Charter in his new capacity as strategic advisor to me and the executive team. We also recently announced that Chris Winfrey had been promoted Chief Operating Officer. Over the past 11 years, Chris has influenced on Charter, has expanded far beyond that of a typical CFO. He has been actively involved in all our business operations and that deep knowledge combined with his previous operational experience in Europe, will serve us well as Charter's next Chief Operating Officer. And John's guidance as Vice Chairman, will help ensure a successful transition for Chris into the COO role. As Chris moves to COO, we've also promoted Jessica Fischer, previously Executive Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer. Jessica's leadership and financial expertise has benefited Charter for many years, both in her roles at Charter and while at E&Y, where she was a key advisor during our 2016 transactions. In our new growth, Jessica will have an even greater impact on Charter's success. Finally, Rich [Indiscernible], our Chief Products and Technology Officer, ads oversight of network and software operations to his current responsibilities, leading the product and technology organization with expanded responsibility, Rich who both shaped the customer experience and lead our network's critical evolution into the 10G future, delivering to our customers a superior broadband connectivity experience. Now I will turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. I wanted to make a few comments about what we're seeing in the marketplace and briefly discuss our long-term market opportunity. Residential customer activity, particularly churn, has taken longer than we expected to return to normal levels. The overall lower level of market churn has reduced sales opportunities available to us. But interestingly, the value of net additions is even higher in this environment. We still maintained good continued customer growth. Given that the start of Q4 feels similar to Q3, we now expect current-year Internet net adds to look more like 2018 than 2019, as record low churn of every type has not offset higher loss selling opportunities from competitors churn. That lower overall transaction volume has exposed the high level underlying EBITDA and cash flow growth that is normally matched by even higher unit growth. With fewer new customers than usual, we have a lower mix of customers on promotion benefiting our customer relationship [Indiscernible]. Additionally, lower sales volume has driven lower expense and capital expenditures associated with sales and installation, lower upfront provisioning cost, and fewer service calls and truck rolls, which are more frequent with newer customers. Ultimately, market churn will return, driving more sales opportunities, and a return to normal net addition environment for Charter. As that happens, we would expect a reversal of some of the transactional financial benefits I mentioned a moment ago. We thought that would happen by the summer of this year, but it hasn't happened quite yet. Lower transactions have lowered costs and at the same time, our cost per existing customer relationship continues to get better. Our service model drives lower service calls and truck rolls with nearly 100% in-sourcing of our call centers now, improving tools for employees, and increasing customer usage of our digital and automated platforms. The service churn and expense benefits of those initiatives will continue for years. We've also continued to invest in our product marketing sales capabilities, and our yield for close rate has been growing, albeit on lower sales traffic. And we continue to grow Internet customers across our footprint, regardless of the competitive technology or in Infrastructure. Earlier this month, we announced new mobile multi-line pricing designed to drive new mobile relationships, more lines per relationship, and ultimately, stimulate overall market movement and sales opportunities for all of our products, including Internet. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package. And we offer the nation's fastest overall mobile service, combined with our Wi - Fi invest mobile pricing, which offers unlimited service for just $29.99 per line per month in households which have two or more lines. An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors with two lines and mobile broadband and wireline broadband spends approximately $200 per month on its telecom services. With our pricing and packaging, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and two lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less, and with more lines means more savings. And customers can also combine 5-a-gig rate plans for $14 per gig, with 1 or more unlimited lines to take advantage of the new 29.99 unlimited line pricing. Today, we have roughly 2 million of our 54 million passing\u2019s subscribed to this converged connectivity service. So as Tom mentioned, we have a very long runway for customer and market share growth created by an ability to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. As Tom mentioned, Jessica has been promoted to CFO. I had the opportunity to work with Jessica for over 10 years, 5 years, while she was partner at E&Y advising us. Including on the structure of the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. In the past five years, she's been at Charter, she steadily grown our responsibilities from initially overseeing tax and treasury, that in procurement, internal audit, investor relations, and acquisitions and capital markets activities, all of which has prepared her to take over the CFO role. Now I will turn the call over to Jessica to cover our Q3 results in more detail.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. Total residential and SMB customer relationships by 185,000 in the third quarter and by 1 million in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our internet customers by 265,000 in the quarter and by 1.3 million or 4.4% over the last 12 months. Video declined by a 121,000 in the third quarter. Wireline voice declined by 216,000 and we added 244,000 mobile lines in the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had 3.2 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality attractively - priced service, rather than using device subsidies. Moving to our financial results starting on slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by over 900,000 or 3.2%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 5.6% year-over-year, given last year's third quarter residential revenue adjustment of 218 million per sports network credits that we provided to video customers, as well as promotional rates step-ups, video rate adjustments that passed through programmer rate increases and a greater mix of longer tenured customers. Those were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of choice essentials and stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 9.4% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth in last year's COVID impacts. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 7.5%. This growth rate reflects COVID related impacts of $11 million that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2020, excluding this impact from last year SMB revenue grew by 6.3% faster than the second quarter growth when making the same COVID related adjustment. Enterprise revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year and included some one-time fees which were a benefit in this quarter. Excluding the benefit from this year, enterprise revenue grew by 3.8% and by 6.5% when additionally excluding all wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.5% year-over-year. Third quarter advertising revenue declined 15.1% year-over-year, primarily due to less political revenue in 2021, partially offset by COVID impact last year. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, advertising revenue declined by 0.8%, primarily due to local ad revenue, particularly auto, mostly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Excluding auto, the third quarter advertising grew by 8% over the third quarter of 2019. Mobile revenue totaled 535 million, with 201 million of that revenue being device revenue, and other revenue grew by 6.5% year-over-year. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7, in Q3, total operating expenses grew by 460 million or 6.2% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 9.4% year-over-year due to last year's third quarter benefit of 163 million related to sports network rebates and higher programming rates. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages such as choice, essentials, and stream. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 3.5%, primarily driven by higher regulatory and franchise fees and video CPE s sold to the customers. Cost to service customer's were essentially flat year-over-year compared to 3.3% customer relationship growth, excluding bad debt, cost-to-service customers declined by 2.8% year-over-year. And that's despite a higher number of customers and outsize hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Bad debt was higher by $47 million year-over-year, but still nearly $75 million were lower when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Marketing expenses were also flat year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower sales environment. Mobile expenses totaled $607 million and were comprised at mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition, and service and operating costs, and other expenses grew by 3.8%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs, partially offset by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year, given the absence of political revenue this year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13.9% in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus 814 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Training to Slide 9, capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the third quarter below last year's third quarter spend of 2 billion driven by lower scalable infrastructure spend primarily due to a stabilized level of network traffic growth at investments made earlier this year. a decrease in line extension spend driven by housing built delays due to supply chain constraints in the housing industry and lower support capital primarily due to timing. We spent $119 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital, and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full-year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. As slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of $722 million or 41.2% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.9 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in October is $4.1 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.32 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million Charter shares in Charter holdings, common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $753 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased $12 billion of our stock in common unit and since September of 2016, we have repurchased $51.4 billion or 37.5% of Charter's equity at an average price of $436 per share. Our results show that even in this unusual environment, our flexible and robust business and service model, which benefits economically from lower customer transaction activity still drives outstanding EBITDA and free cash flow. Coupling that with our unique balance sheet structure and a proven capital allocation strategy, we will continue to produce shareholder value for years to come. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore.\nVijay Jayant: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to of unpack obviously, some of the trends on broadband. There's some sense out there that some of this could be competition. Is there any way you can talk about what you're seeing in the marketplace from fiber or fixed wireless in any sense? And then question on -- for Tom Rutledge on your CapEx comments this morning, it looks like you're going to deploy high-splits and -- that will probably reduce the need of doing notes as going forward, can you talk about broadly the cost impact of that shift in strategy if you go down that path, [Indiscernible] bring forward some CapEx while the total CapEx there is a lot really changed over the long term, is that really the message? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Let me start with the high-split question first. And we are deploying it in market to see how it works and how it actually works in the real world. But our sense of it is that you get symmetrical gigabit speeds out of it. But you also get the augmentation capacity that we've been spending capital on for years as average consumer growth in usage of data continues to increase. And so when you take the actual capital and let that against it, it becomes a very low cost of incremental capital. And at the same time becomes operationally a lot more capable in terms of the products that you can deliver on the network. So we think it's a very capital-efficient way of upgrading the network and maintaining our superiority from a competitive point of view everywhere we operate. In terms of how we're doing in the marketplace and what the competitive environment's like, The competitive environment is similar to what it's been and when we look at the effects of the marketplace in terms of net ads in the churn environment we're in. We're seeing the same effect where there are no wireline competitors as we do with wireline competitors in terms of net ads, proportionately to -- say 2019. And so we're seeing that the competitive environment doesn't appear to be significantly different than it has been. It's always been a competitive environment. And that the effects of a lower activity are, throughout the marketplace, regardless of what the infrastructure we're competing against is.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Vijay, April will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. And congratulations, Chris and Jessica on the promotions. I want to ask questions similar to Vijah's, if you don't mind, I guess two of them. One is you guys are obviously describing an environment that is impacting, that adds tied to activity, but the market is focused on competition. If we were to look at markets that Charter operates in with fiber competition, I know AT&T;s been adding fiber for a number of years. Would we see a dramatically different business in terms of penetration and ARPU and even pricing strategy than if we looked at Charter's footprint in DSL market? I think that'd be a helpful framework to think about this. And then number 2 is on the network, again, following Vijay 's line of thought. And Chris be interested in your perspective given your European experience. We're seeing some cable companies in Europe essentially skip Docsis 4.0 and go fiber. And I know there is major structural differences there versus here, but I'm just wondering if there's any thought in your head about where fiber might make sense or what would cause you to move towards fiber-to-the-home versus 4.0 and extended Spectrum Docsis, which seems to be your plan A right now. Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts on those two. Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: I would just -- I would say that in fiber markets versus DSL markets, that our business model works pretty much the same way. And there are slight variations and penetration everywhere we operate for a variety of reasons, but they're very similar businesses and our growth rates are similar structurally. So we've been able to grow market share in every environment we operate in. Pretty much in terms of facilities based competition for variety of reasons. It's not just capacity in every case. It's sometimes services, sometimes the overall product mix, including the mobile piece of it. We've found ways to make our product work regards of the operating environment.\nChris Winfrey: The difference between Europe and the U.S. they're completely different densities. And we do fiber-to-the-home today in rural environments, often in [Indiscernible] environments and on the increment we're doing greenfield, but the capabilities of the DOCSIS 3.1 network, it really has a very long runway which is what Tom has mentioned at extremely low capital costs and provides all kinds of opportunity, including picking overtime, how you attack with Docsis 4.0 and fiber-to-the-home. But we have a really capital-efficient path that doesn't -- that means that we don't have to go down that safe path. And a lot of the difference here is, I think, driven more by density than anything else.\nTom Rutledge: Density in conduits and the way markets are built, it's a much different environment here. But the reality is that we can upgrade our network at way less than it cost to build fiber platform over top of it. And fiber works for us on the incremental [Indiscernible], it works for us in certain kinds of MDU Environments, certain kinds of greenfield new construction environments. But in terms of taking existing infrastructure that we've already deployed in three quarters of a million miles of Infrastructure essentially -- that we can upgrade at very low costs. Orders of magnitude less than a cost to build fiber and get equal performance. In those cases faster, and do it quickly.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Ketan Moreau with RBC Capital Markets.\nKetan Moreau: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I was hoping for more color on residential ARPU trends. The quarter came in strong even when backing out the Coder comps against last year. I know this was partly related to the June rate event, but you also noted benefits from a more favorable customer mix. Customer mix given how low churn has been. I guess, given your commentary on 2021 net adds looking more like 2018, should we assume these positive ARPU trends could continue not only into the fourth quarter, but also into early 2022. It's just -- I assume that even if market activity picks up, it would likely take a few quarters to reverse some of this tailwind in your overall subscriber mix would appreciate your perspectives. Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. So first I'd point you back to Citi share and the COVID picture that there is a big piece of the year-over-year ARPU increase that's related to the revenue credits in Q3 of last year. But I do you think you pointed out something, the lower churn environment benefits us in a large number of ways. And one of those is on the ARPU side. The longer that a customer stays with idea of more customers [Indiscernible] roll off of promotional packages and therefore roll into higher pricing packages. And we have a low churn environment where you have additional longer tenured customers. We do see some impact on ARPU from that. The other pieces in there that you pointed out is the additional programmers sort of pass-through costs that we pushed at the end of the quarter. So there's a mix of the three. There will -- I think if we continue to be in the low Churn Environment, continue to be some ARPU impact. Just having longer tenured customers in the system. And the financial results of having those customers in the system for longer really are very good both on the revenue and the transactions side which is some of what you see. And in the overall financial results for the quarter.\nChris Winfrey: I would just add to that that if you think about it from a return on investment perspective, every customer you add in a low churn environment is more valuable than a customer you add in a higher churn environment because the average life of the customer is longer, therefore, the total cash flow of the customer is longer and the cost to serve the passing from a transaction cost perspective is less. So it's a from a financial point of view, a slower growth environment related to churn being reduced is actually economically positive from ROI perspective.\nKetan Moreau: That's perfect. Thank you both.\nStefan Anninger: Thank you April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Follow-up and a question, and echo my congratulations to Chris, Jessica and Rich. It's all deserves. First on Vijay's question, you said the ads are more valuable. I think Chris, does that mean you are seeing something similar to Comcast in a slower low-end customer and consistent high-end. And any thoughts on whether wireless, fixed or mobile might be pulling more of that low-end then. And then Tom, can you expand on your CBRs trial comments. How wide a trial is this? [Indiscernible] sites? Anything you can help us with there. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: I'll do a quick answer on the CBRS. It's an entire DMA market test, thousands of sites because they are whole monitored sites, small cells, relatively speaking. I don't know the exact number, but it's an entire DMA. In terms of customer mix acquisition, it's true that the programs that we put in place in the midst of COVID last year, where there is the remote education offer or the way that we worked with customers where they keep Americans connected credit meant that both from a sales, as well as from a retention perspective, there was a locking end and there was securing the lower-income population and for any of them on as Charter customers. We're really pleased that we did it. So is that a pull-forward maybe that took place last year? But that doesn't mean that we haven't stopped --that we have -- we stopped marketing and selling into that base. We've been an active participant in the Emergency Broadband funds. I wouldn't say that it's created in the third quarter in incremental acquisition. Vast majority has come into that program through our existing subscribers. But we're utilizing our federal program to make sure that we service that community and continue to actively market, sell, and service\nTom Rutledge: into the space. But your point is true there. There is certainly a lot of people who had been on wireless substitution in the past or had affordability issues that through the things that we did cooperating with the federal government, we were able to get them to proper broadband we benefited from that last year, we've managed to keep those customers through the course of this year, but the same level of inflow of sales looking lower.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks for.\nPhil Cusick: That contributes to lower churn environment as well.\nTom Rutledge: Correct.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett : Hi, good morning. And let me join the parade of all the congratulations to Jessica and to Chris and to Rich and to John. So two questions if I could. First just digging into the broadband dynamics one more time. In this low churn environment, have you seen any change in the share of gross editions that you're winning. So my understanding is the gross addition pool is clearly suppressed by low churn, but has there been any change in your Windshare as far as you can tell, among what's left in gross additions. And then as you think about the upcoming CBRS offload trial, what's your expected offload? What's your target for how much of the -- what would otherwise go over the cellular contract with Verizon that you think you can offload onto the CBRS small cells?\nTom Rutledge: So on the -- on your -- the first part of your question on broadband growth say, are you talking about new construction growth?\nCraig Moffett : No, just in the smaller gross addition pool that's available. Given that customers are just moving less and churn ing less. But in that smaller pool that's available, do you have any sense that your share of wins has changed at all?\nJessica Fischer: So --\nTom Rutledge: Go ahead.\nJessica Fischer: I guess -- okay, we've seen that in the sense that you come in during the yields are actually going up. So the number of sales that come in that we are able to close and convert to customers has been increasing. I haven't it looked at it exactly. And Chris.\nChris Winfrey: That's -- our share of activity is actually higher from the activity that we see in front of us, our ability to attach mobile units to transaction is going up. There's just less of them. And -- but no, in terms of -- I don't see really a change or shift of any material way that I can see in the numbers in terms of our acquisition share, our churn is down in all types of markets, with all types of infrastructure that we operate in front of. And our gross adds are down proportionately inside all of those same footprints. So there isn't any incremental change in any material way in gross adds based on the foot print in which we operate, it's just lower transaction volume taking place across the entire board.\nCraig Moffett : It sounds a lot like what you're describing is just that a low mobility and low household formation market.\nTom Rutledge: That's true. And how that unwinds is unclear. I mean, there was -- it's a very unusual market situation. People sheltered in place, so to speak. And so you had all the friction of the market came out that used to exist, people in transition, and they settled into subscriptions. And when the market remobilizes, so to speak, I think there will be continued pressure on gross because of pull-forward of all of that activity. But it is I think the [Indiscernible] opportunity for growth and long-term growth is still the same and our ability to take share out of the market is still the same. In terms of CBRS, today 80% of the traffic on mobile platforms is on Wi-Fi. And our -- and we continue to use the Wi-Fi network effectively. And there's a whole new piece of spectrum available to Wi-Fi, available to us. So Wi-Fi and CBRS together have an opportunity to make a significant change in how much traffic is on our network versus on the MVNO. Our targeted for CBRS, I've said before could be pushing up third of the marketplace if everything works and it's fully deployed now. You're talking years of runway necessary to deploy that and to get it fully utilized. The good thing about it is that the capital associated with any construction we do is dedicated to the -- to a lower cost. In other words, if we're going to put out a device or a radio, we know where the traffic flows are, we know that the traffic flows in that particular area justify the capital of placing that device. And that the offload percentage that's associated with that specific geography is sufficient to pay back the capital investment in the radio. It's a -- we'll deploy that based on actual utilization. But our modeling shows that it could be a significant reduction in the overall traffic load on the MBO.\nCraig Moffett : Thanks. That's helpful.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Just to start off, a quick housekeeping question, and then I've got another one as well. For anchoring off of 2018, and I guess this is the question for Chris, should we be anchoring off of residential net adds of 1.1 million or total net adds of closer to 1.3 million? And then following up from one of the earlier questions, the -- I recognized the color you're giving on the transition of the network to high-splits, and that's extremely helpful. I'm wondering if you can give us some indication of how long that transition to high-splits across the network will take. And then when more or less, do you expect to start folding in the DOCSIS 4.0 upgrade? And then my final question on broadband ads. Are you assuming any benefit in the broadband ads guidance that you're giving for 4Q effectively from a pull-through from the lower wireless rate plans that you've put out there. So if wireless accelerate, should that have a pull through benefit broadband? And is that baked into your expectations? Thanks, guys.\nTom Rutledge: Okay. In the timing, high-split opportunity from a timing perspective is also opportunistic. like I was describing CBRS, but it's relatively inexpensive like a CBRS deployment. Excuse me like 3.1s Docsis deployment was. And it's on per passing basis. We think it will be quite efficient, but it -- the other beauty of it is it's pretty much in electronic drop in and it could be done quite rapidly. And cover huge slots of geography in a very short period of time. And so it has two benefits. One, it just -- if you do it in an sort of a normal management of augmentation network growth pattern, sort of deployment, it replaces the need to do node splits. But if you do it quickly, it also has the same effect, but it gives you greater capacity in terms of what products you can deploy in a market and what marketing claims you can make. So it can be done quite quickly and that's the beauty of it. Do you want [Indiscernible]\nChris Winfrey: Sure. The 2018 comments that I made was really in the context of total internet additions. The answer to your question is yes.\nTom Rutledge: And it's got a pull forward, but this mobile pricing pull forward,\nChris Winfrey: It's only been out in the market for [Indiscernible], so we should be careful of what we say. But the initial uplift for mobile sales has been fairly significant as we expected. And while we think it could and should have a material impact on broadband over a multiyear period. We haven't seen anything yet that indicates that's the case. And so I think it's [Indiscernible] we expect [Indiscernible]. We expected and we didn't expect it. So I think it's premature to think that we're going to see that pull through the internet just yet.\nJonathan Chaplin: [Indiscernible]. Thanks, guys and congratulations to both you and Jessica and Chris.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan, April, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. Just a couple of follow-up questions on wireless. When we look at your wireless pricing strategy, you've done the exact opposite of what major carriers are doing, which is you've offered your consumers a great deal on their service price, but you're not necessarily offering a promo on the handsets. And so at least it's sort of two questions. The first is, what are you thinking about handset promotions? Meaning, would you be willing to also incorporate them into your price point, particularly as consumers look to upgrade to 5G devices\nBrett Feldman: and they are offered promos elsewhere? And then bigger picture, I mean, the key reason it looks like you were able to lower your prices recently is because you were able to get a better cost structure under the MVNO agreement, meaning that you took your lower costs and you converted them into lower prices. The question would be, if you're pleased with the success of the CBRS trial, what does that mean for your wireless businesses? Does it mean that you have an opportunity to be more profitable or do you think that's an opportunity to take your price point down even further, because once again, you'll have lower your costs? Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: I'd say both.\nJessica Fischer: If you look at our total opportunity relative to customer spend on combined mobile and broadband, there's a lot of broadband spend -- a lot of mobile spend out there relative to broadband spend. So if you think about a customer, typical two-line household, they might be spending a total of $200 on broadband and mobile. And today, we're only getting a relatively small piece of that. And so if we continue to sell mobile product, even if we do it by bringing the pricing of mobile down, our expectation is that we'll continue to drive both revenue growth and bottom line EBITDA growth from that business, all wall driving pricing down in the mobile industry. And from the perspective of our mobile business, even today, our mobile business is profitable if you take customer acquisition costs down. And like what we've done across our business, our goal is always to further penetrate the market. And so if we can increase our penetration of the mobile market and up more ongoing revenues and less customer acquisition costs, okay, not less, even with additional customer acquisition costs, we'll generate strong profits out of that business just by penetrating the market, sticking with our strategy of having very competitive pricing for our customers.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. I agree that -- I think that one way of thinking about it is -- we have 55% penetration of our broadband business at about a $60 ARPU on average, and the average spend on mobile on a per home basis inside our footprint is over $120 a month. And the average number of devices inside our footprint is about 120 million. And so when you really look at our 6% mobile penetration and our 55% broadband penetration, and look at that as a share of spend, even if you cut the mobile average household price in half, where our penetration of the dollar is less than 30%, which is -- which means what I said earlier in the presentation, which is we're really underpenetrated and there's lots of Telecom spend in which to grow our business at the household level.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Bryan. April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Peter Zaffino with Bernstein.\nPeter Zaffino: Hey, good morning. Wanted to go back to this sector of ARPU with fiber and fixed wireless, segmenting broadband, presumably in 2022 and beyond, I wondered if you could talk with us a bit about how you manage local pricing in response to those local deployments and whether that might result in some ARPU, growth, deceleration, albeit still at nice positive rates in the years to come.\nChris Winfrey: You want me to take [Indiscernible]\nTom Rutledge: Sure.\nChris Winfrey: So we have national pricing everywhere for our retail pricing, and it's low compared to any of our peers or competitors. And we have the ability to bundle products that most of those competitors that you mentioned don't have. So if you think about low broadband pricings at national retail pricing combined with the ability to save customers hundreds or thousands of dollars in mobile, and increasingly, because of where the rest of the market has gone, we have the very best video product out there. And that may not be for everybody because there's a lot of different ways to take video, but Our video product -- we have something for everybody, whether it's a full expanded package, where there is blend matino, or whether it's essential stream choice in the home, outside the home, on every single device. So, we have a package and price point for just about everybody and still about half of our internet sales still take video. And it causes them to retain so we're able to add value to these households, not just by having a national low retail pricing structure for broadband, but the ability to use video and to use the savings from mobile to compete now, and really for a long period of time. So that's how we approach the marketplace. It's really how we've always approached the marketplace, including back to if you think about phone, where the pricing, and again, it's only maybe half the customer base that's relevant for it, but it is relevant for half, where we have a total dollar price point for phone as well. So we have different ways we can save customers' money, and we think the product that we offer anyway in broadband is as good, if not better than any competitive footprint that we face.\nTom Rutledge: And ultimately price -- what you can do with price is a function of what costs are, and we have lowered costs.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Peter. April, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. First question on video. You guys saw some accelerating video and voice losses, actually this quarter. That is the function of the catch rates and lower broadband ads or is there a sort of a reopening issue there as well? Or maybe did the price increase in June, affect those numbers? And then, getting back to the wireless. Clearly wireless and broadband is a new bundle. And thanks for the number, 2 million households so far having that bundle. I mean, it's early yet. But can we look at the churn within that cohort and see whether or not you're actually seeing an improvement versus standalone broadband? And if so, can you maybe give us a sense of the change in churn that you may be seeing? Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: On the video and voice losses front, I think that that one is just the impact of having the -- not having the level of broadband additions that we had in 2020. when you have a lot of broadband additions, we pulled through a lot of recent video in bundling there, in this lower gross add lower churn environment. It's just carried through of the prior trends. It's no overall change in trend.\nChris Winfrey: On the churn benefit for a broadband customer also takes wireless. I can sit here and advertise and tell you how fantastic it is, the churn is definitely lower and I can beat our chest about it. But some of that -- a lot of that is really at this point, they're just self selection of customers are happy with our service. They like who we are, they like the pricing that they have on the products, and as a result, they take more product from us. I don't know that, that means there's enough evidence now to say systemically, but our gut tells us the answer is yes. And while the numbers would tell us yesterday as well, I don't think you should rely on that, in terms of an order of magnitude until we get further down the road.\nTom Rutledge: And the term, it's all [Indiscernible] is so low relative to the sort of trend that it's hard to attributed it all.\nChris Winfrey: That's right.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks, guys.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, John.\nStefan Anninger: April, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question is from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much, and I have my congratulations to Jessica and Chris and Rich. I will stick with broadband and wireless, seems. Tom, just a clarification on you mentioned the pandemic was a pull -forward, and I think you emphasized share opportunities. Should we think about the growth opportunity really as share focus going forward and that the broadband marketplace is broadly fairly mature after this pandemic pull-forward. And then I guess jump all though Chris, I know your experienced in Europe might inform this and it seemed like Bryan Roberts yesterday was implying that they're thinking about launching a converged in-home out-of-home, broadband offering and I'm sure you've been thinking about the same thing. Is there an opportunity to disrupt the marketplace by having a single converged by-the-home subscription rather than thinking about it as a per-phone plus per-home subscription model? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: So, Doug, I wouldn't say broadband is mature in the sense that, we think high capacity broadband, which we sell and packaged with mobility and packaged with great home connectivity, and managed Wi - Fi. Is still a growth opportunity in two ways. You have, what will the number of people that ultimately take that level of service be. And in our footprint today, we think 93% of houses are occupied. And I think the penetration of any kind of Internet service in that footprint is about 85%. So there's still opportunity to grow the overall connectivity broadband market. And then there's the opportunity to actually grow it into the high capacity service that we sell and high-quality service we sell. So we think that while we have 55% penetration, there's 37% penetration more to go in terms of what other possibilities are there. Plus the whole broadband -- mobile broadband platform as well and which grew very under penetrated.\nChris Winfrey: Doug, your question -- yes, it's true, it's a decade in European cable, but it's also been a decade since I've been there. So I don't know that I'm really any longer qualified to make comparisons or talking about it. But your question was -- and I apologize if I haven't followed it, but the -- that could you offer a mobile subscription together with broadband and have the mobile lines be part of the home subscription to multi-line?\nDoug Mitchelson: Yeah. Just a single price for a household to have as many devices as they want in and out of the home.\nChris Winfrey: It's an interesting concept and I know what it's trying to solve. I mean, for all the reasons that you can think convergence tech technically makes a lot of sense. The ability to have a ubiquitous Internet product inside the home, outside of the home, in the neighborhood, in the coffee shop, etc. All that which we talked about and it works. The ability to save customers tons of money, which we do. There are not that many markets where from a marketing and sales machine, it's been fully proven out yet of how you combine that together when lines are often sold at a personal level, and broadband subscription wireline is sold at a household level. So I think it's an interesting concept, one that we're keeping our eye on. And when you think about as our pricing gets lower, mobile bridging our way towards that one way or another. It's one another way of thinking about it. But I think those type of models and taking a look at how to fully get convergence also for marketing and sales and solve the difference between per line versus per household is interesting.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Doug. April, we'll take our last question, please.\nOperator: And your last question is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you for getting me on. I guess one last question on broadband to beat a dead horse and then one other question. On the Internet ads on the SMB side, that's slowed as well. And that's an area that seems to have kind of normalized a bit more than residential. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on commercial? And then on, X Class TV that the Comcast talked about rolling out, is there anything in this service to the extent that [Indiscernible] by an X Class TV, are there any benefits or economic that you get or would you consider shifting to becoming an aggregator of streaming services, which with the different set of economics from linear?\nTom Rutledge: You can answer.\nChris Winfrey: I think the SMB space is really more about cyclicality right now related to COVID and how things have opened and shutdown and businesses have closed and restarted and new businesses formed. I think it's much more tied to that than the things that we're seeing in the residential side. Generally, I would say that our SMB capabilities are as good as ever right now. And in a market where you have new business is forming or coming back online, where our competitive posture there is very good and I don't see the same type of issues that we've talked about in residential for us in this. So the fluctuations you've been seeing really much more about just the overall economic cyclicality has taken place with COVID, but I wouldn't --we don't face the same type of issues from market movement that we're seeing in residential in the SMB space. Our opportunity for theirs remains good and same as residential long-term.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. So from a streaming perspective, it's interesting Charter's actually the biggest live-streaming app in the country and the most highly rated app in the country. We distribute streaming products on Roku, Apple TV, on our own set-top boxes. We've got the cloud-based streaming application that can be placed on our app-based streaming app system that can be placed right on our set-top boxes. And so we've got more than 10 million customers who are connected to us strictly through a streaming relationship. And we like the Comcast strategy with regard to their -- putting their platform on televisions. And so, we think there's lots of opportunity for us to continue to change the video model and to take advantage of our relationship with customers and to make the video model more efficient for programmers and for operators, and to bring value back into television.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jessica. That concludes our call. Thanks to everyone. And April I'll pass back to you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. I wanted to make a few comments about what we're seeing in the marketplace and briefly discuss our long-term market opportunity. Residential customer activity, particularly churn, has taken longer than we expected to return to normal levels. The overall lower level of market churn has reduced sales opportunities available to us. But interestingly, the value of net additions is even higher in this environment. We still maintained good continued customer growth. Given that the start of Q4 feels similar to Q3, we now expect current-year Internet net adds to look more like 2018 than 2019, as record low churn of every type has not offset higher loss selling opportunities from competitors churn. That lower overall transaction volume has exposed the high level underlying EBITDA and cash flow growth that is normally matched by even higher unit growth. With fewer new customers than usual, we have a lower mix of customers on promotion benefiting our customer relationship [Indiscernible]. Additionally, lower sales volume has driven lower expense and capital expenditures associated with sales and installation, lower upfront provisioning cost, and fewer service calls and truck rolls, which are more frequent with newer customers. Ultimately, market churn will return, driving more sales opportunities, and a return to normal net addition environment for Charter. As that happens, we would expect a reversal of some of the transactional financial benefits I mentioned a moment ago. We thought that would happen by the summer of this year, but it hasn't happened quite yet. Lower transactions have lowered costs and at the same time, our cost per existing customer relationship continues to get better. Our service model drives lower service calls and truck rolls with nearly 100% in-sourcing of our call centers now, improving tools for employees, and increasing customer usage of our digital and automated platforms. The service churn and expense benefits of those initiatives will continue for years. We've also continued to invest in our product marketing sales capabilities, and our yield for close rate has been growing, albeit on lower sales traffic. And we continue to grow Internet customers across our footprint, regardless of the competitive technology or in Infrastructure. Earlier this month, we announced new mobile multi-line pricing designed to drive new mobile relationships, more lines per relationship, and ultimately, stimulate overall market movement and sales opportunities for all of our products, including Internet. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package. And we offer the nation's fastest overall mobile service, combined with our Wi - Fi invest mobile pricing, which offers unlimited service for just $29.99 per line per month in households which have two or more lines. An average household served by the big 3 mobile broadband competitors with two lines and mobile broadband and wireline broadband spends approximately $200 per month on its telecom services. With our pricing and packaging, a Spectrum customer can purchase our Internet product and two lines of our unlimited mobile product with faster service for nearly 50% less, and with more lines means more savings. And customers can also combine 5-a-gig rate plans for $14 per gig, with 1 or more unlimited lines to take advantage of the new 29.99 unlimited line pricing. Today, we have roughly 2 million of our 54 million passing's subscribed to this converged connectivity service. So as Tom mentioned, we have a very long runway for customer and market share growth created by an ability to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. As Tom mentioned, Jessica has been promoted to CFO. I had the opportunity to work with Jessica for over 10 years, 5 years, while she was partner at E&Y advising us. Including on the structure of the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. In the past five years, she's been at Charter, she steadily grown our responsibilities from initially overseeing tax and treasury, that in procurement, internal audit, investor relations, and acquisitions and capital markets activities, all of which has prepared her to take over the CFO role. Now I will turn the call over to Jessica to cover our Q3 results in more detail. The difference between Europe and the U.S. they're completely different densities. And we do fiber-to-the-home today in rural environments, often in [Indiscernible] environments and on the increment we're doing greenfield, but the capabilities of the DOCSIS 3.1 network, it really has a very long runway which is what Tom has mentioned at extremely low capital costs and provides all kinds of opportunity, including picking overtime, how you attack with Docsis 4.0 and fiber-to-the-home. But we have a really capital-efficient path that doesn't -- that means that we don't have to go down that safe path. And a lot of the difference here is, I think, driven more by density than anything else. I would just add to that that if you think about it from a return on investment perspective, every customer you add in a low churn environment is more valuable than a customer you add in a higher churn environment because the average life of the customer is longer, therefore, the total cash flow of the customer is longer and the cost to serve the passing from a transaction cost perspective is less. So it's a from a financial point of view, a slower growth environment related to churn being reduced is actually economically positive from ROI perspective. I'll do a quick answer on the CBRS. It's an entire DMA market test, thousands of sites because they are whole monitored sites, small cells, relatively speaking. I don't know the exact number, but it's an entire DMA. In terms of customer mix acquisition, it's true that the programs that we put in place in the midst of COVID last year, where there is the remote education offer or the way that we worked with customers where they keep Americans connected credit meant that both from a sales, as well as from a retention perspective, there was a locking end and there was securing the lower-income population and for any of them on as Charter customers. We're really pleased that we did it. So is that a pull-forward maybe that took place last year? But that doesn't mean that we haven't stopped --that we have -- we stopped marketing and selling into that base. We've been an active participant in the Emergency Broadband funds. I wouldn't say that it's created in the third quarter in incremental acquisition. Vast majority has come into that program through our existing subscribers. But we're utilizing our federal program to make sure that we service that community and continue to actively market, sell, and service That's -- our share of activity is actually higher from the activity that we see in front of us, our ability to attach mobile units to transaction is going up. There's just less of them. And -- but no, in terms of -- I don't see really a change or shift of any material way that I can see in the numbers in terms of our acquisition share, our churn is down in all types of markets, with all types of infrastructure that we operate in front of. And our gross adds are down proportionately inside all of those same footprints. So there isn't any incremental change in any material way in gross adds based on the foot print in which we operate, it's just lower transaction volume taking place across the entire board. Sure. The 2018 comments that I made was really in the context of total internet additions. The answer to your question is yes. It's only been out in the market for [Indiscernible], so we should be careful of what we say. But the initial uplift for mobile sales has been fairly significant as we expected. And while we think it could and should have a material impact on broadband over a multiyear period. We haven't seen anything yet that indicates that's the case.

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Good morning and thank you, Stefan. We performed well in the third quarter, with good customer growth and very strong financial results. However, we're operating in an unusual environment where the market effects of COVID-19 have not yet normalized. Market churn remains historically low such that net gains are being driven by much lower transaction activity. Despite that, for the full quarter, we added 185,000 customer relationships, with customer growth of 3.3% year-over-year. We also added 265,000 Internet customers in the quarter, and 1.3 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 4.4%. We added 244,000 mobile lines and supported by lower churn and a more tenured customer base, we grew our adjusted EBITDA by a strong 13.9% in our quarterly free cash flow by over 700 million year-over-year. Our view is that we have a long and robust runway of customer growth ahead of us. Today, our network passes over 54 million homes and businesses, and we're doing business with approximately 32 million of them, leaving us with over 20 million opportunities to create new customer relationships. There also approximately 120 million mobile broadband lines in our footprint, and we are currently serving 3.2 million of those. We're currently very underpenetrated. We're looking forward -- looking forward, we remain focused on improving both the quality and value of our products as data usage in the home and outside the home continues to increase at a rapid pace. Earlier this month, we launched our new and highly attractive unlimited multiline pricing structure, which allows customers to save even more on their mobile bills. Early next year, we will launch a field trial of our CBRS small cells in a full market area, allowing participants to attach to our CBRS small cell access points when they are outside of Wi - Fi coverage, providing our spectrum mobile customers with even faster speeds, while improving the economics of our mobile business. We also continue to deliver improving wireline connectivity products. Today, over 70% of our Internet customers subscribe to tiers that provide 200 megabits or more of speed. And our new Wi - Fi 6 Routers and Spectrum Wi-Fi pods managed by our advanced home Wi - Fi platform and our -- My Spectrum App. Provide customers with complete home coverage and greater control of their home networks and connected devices. As expected, we continue to see very high demand for data by our customers. During the quarter, non-video Internet customers used over 600 gigabytes per month, stable as of late, but more than 30% higher than pre -pandemic levels. And today, close to 20% of our non-video Internet customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. In order to increase the capacity and speed on our network for next-generation products and services, we've developed a multifaceted approach to our network evolution comprised of a number of technologies which will be deployed where they make the most sense strategically and economically, delivering the very fastest speeds and lowest latency at the lowest cost and time to deploy. We continued to expand our capacity by splitting nodes, but we have a cost -effective approach to deliver multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and a gigabit per second -- symmetrical speeds in both downstream and upstream directions, all using our deployed DOCSIS 3.1 platform. And high-splits, which are currently being tested in market, not only allow for increased speeds in the near-term, but are also a capital-efficient way, as they currently use deployed DOCSIS 3.1 customer premises equipment and reduce the need for node splits, which require an average consumer bandwidth utilization, which will require as consumer bandwidth utilization increase. What I'm saying there is that the high-split actually uses the capital that was needed for node splits. We also continue to actively develop our DOCSIS 4.0 [Indiscernible] technology plant architecture, and roll-out, which allows us to cost effectively and cost efficiently offer greater gigabit speeds in both the downstream and upstream. And of course, we're already using fiber-to-the-home technology in a number of use cases across our footprint, including rural areas such as our [Indiscernible] in an MDUs and Greenfield build areas where the economics makes sense. Ultimately, our plant will be comprised of the most bandwidth - rich and cost -effective technologies, enabling us to deliver the fastest speeds in the industry in a more cost-efficient manner than competitors ubiquitously across 24 million passing's and growing. So with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers penetration, EBITDA, and free cash flow for many years to come. Before turning the call over to Chris, I want to make a few comments about our recently announced management changes and promotions. October 19th, we announced that John Bickham had been appointed Vice Chairman ahead of his previously announced retirement at the end of 2022. I worked with John for 3 decades and at every turn his knowledge, leadership, and steady hand did not only contribute greatly to the success of the Companies we led but made a profound impact on the growth of our industry. I'm grateful that John will continue to serve Charter in his new capacity as strategic advisor to me and the executive team. We also recently announced that Chris Winfrey had been promoted Chief Operating Officer. Over the past 11 years, Chris has influenced on Charter, has expanded far beyond that of a typical CFO. He has been actively involved in all our business operations and that deep knowledge combined with his previous operational experience in Europe, will serve us well as Charter's next Chief Operating Officer. And John's guidance as Vice Chairman, will help ensure a successful transition for Chris into the COO role. As Chris moves to COO, we've also promoted Jessica Fischer, previously Executive Vice President of Finance, Chief Financial Officer. Jessica's leadership and financial expertise has benefited Charter for many years, both in her roles at Charter and while at E&Y, where she was a key advisor during our 2016 transactions. In our new growth, Jessica will have an even greater impact on Charter's success. Finally, Rich [Indiscernible], our Chief Products and Technology Officer, ads oversight of network and software operations to his current responsibilities, leading the product and technology organization with expanded responsibility, Rich who both shaped the customer experience and lead our network's critical evolution into the 10G future, delivering to our customers a superior broadband connectivity experience. Now I will turn the call over to Chris. Let me start with the high-split question first. And we are deploying it in market to see how it works and how it actually works in the real world. But our sense of it is that you get symmetrical gigabit speeds out of it. But you also get the augmentation capacity that we've been spending capital on for years as average consumer growth in usage of data continues to increase. And so when you take the actual capital and let that against it, it becomes a very low cost of incremental capital. And at the same time becomes operationally a lot more capable in terms of the products that you can deliver on the network. So we think it's a very capital-efficient way of upgrading the network and maintaining our superiority from a competitive point of view everywhere we operate. In terms of how we're doing in the marketplace and what the competitive environment's like, The competitive environment is similar to what it's been and when we look at the effects of the marketplace in terms of net ads in the churn environment we're in. We're seeing the same effect where there are no wireline competitors as we do with wireline competitors in terms of net ads, proportionately to -- say 2019. And so we're seeing that the competitive environment doesn't appear to be significantly different than it has been. It's always been a competitive environment. And that the effects of a lower activity are, throughout the marketplace, regardless of what the infrastructure we're competing against is. I would just -- I would say that in fiber markets versus DSL markets, that our business model works pretty much the same way. And there are slight variations and penetration everywhere we operate for a variety of reasons, but they're very similar businesses and our growth rates are similar structurally. So we've been able to grow market share in every environment we operate in. Pretty much in terms of facilities based competition for variety of reasons. It's not just capacity in every case. It's sometimes services, sometimes the overall product mix, including the mobile piece of it. We've found ways to make our product work regards of the operating environment. Density in conduits and the way markets are built, it's a much different environment here. But the reality is that we can upgrade our network at way less than it cost to build fiber platform over top of it. And fiber works for us on the incremental [Indiscernible], it works for us in certain kinds of MDU Environments, certain kinds of greenfield new construction environments. But in terms of taking existing infrastructure that we've already deployed in three quarters of a million miles of Infrastructure essentially -- that we can upgrade at very low costs. Orders of magnitude less than a cost to build fiber and get equal performance. In those cases faster, and do it quickly. into the space. But your point is true there. There is certainly a lot of people who had been on wireless substitution in the past or had affordability issues that through the things that we did cooperating with the federal government, we were able to get them to proper broadband we benefited from that last year, we've managed to keep those customers through the course of this year, but the same level of inflow of sales looking lower. Correct. So on the -- on your -- the first part of your question on broadband growth say, are you talking about new construction growth? Go ahead. That's true. And how that unwinds is unclear. I mean, there was -- it's a very unusual market situation. People sheltered in place, so to speak. And so you had all the friction of the market came out that used to exist, people in transition, and they settled into subscriptions. And when the market remobilizes, so to speak, I think there will be continued pressure on gross because of pull-forward of all of that activity. But it is I think the [Indiscernible] opportunity for growth and long-term growth is still the same and our ability to take share out of the market is still the same. In terms of CBRS, today 80% of the traffic on mobile platforms is on Wi-Fi. And our -- and we continue to use the Wi-Fi network effectively. And there's a whole new piece of spectrum available to Wi-Fi, available to us. So Wi-Fi and CBRS together have an opportunity to make a significant change in how much traffic is on our network versus on the MVNO. Our targeted for CBRS, I've said before could be pushing up third of the marketplace if everything works and it's fully deployed now. You're talking years of runway necessary to deploy that and to get it fully utilized. The good thing about it is that the capital associated with any construction we do is dedicated to the -- to a lower cost. In other words, if we're going to put out a device or a radio, we know where the traffic flows are, we know that the traffic flows in that particular area justify the capital of placing that device. And that the offload percentage that's associated with that specific geography is sufficient to pay back the capital investment in the radio. It's a -- we'll deploy that based on actual utilization. But our modeling shows that it could be a significant reduction in the overall traffic load on the MBO. Okay. In the timing, high-split opportunity from a timing perspective is also opportunistic. like I was describing CBRS, but it's relatively inexpensive like a CBRS deployment. Excuse me like 3.1s Docsis deployment was. And it's on per passing basis. We think it will be quite efficient, but it -- the other beauty of it is it's pretty much in electronic drop in and it could be done quite rapidly. And cover huge slots of geography in a very short period of time. And so it has two benefits. One, it just -- if you do it in an sort of a normal management of augmentation network growth pattern, sort of deployment, it replaces the need to do node splits. But if you do it quickly, it also has the same effect, but it gives you greater capacity in terms of what products you can deploy in a market and what marketing claims you can make. So it can be done quite quickly and that's the beauty of it. Do you want [Indiscernible] And it's got a pull forward, but this mobile pricing pull forward, Thank you. Yes. I agree that -- I think that one way of thinking about it is -- we have 55% penetration of our broadband business at about a $60 ARPU on average, and the average spend on mobile on a per home basis inside our footprint is over $120 a month. And the average number of devices inside our footprint is about 120 million. And so when you really look at our 6% mobile penetration and our 55% broadband penetration, and look at that as a share of spend, even if you cut the mobile average household price in half, where our penetration of the dollar is less than 30%, which is -- which means what I said earlier in the presentation, which is we're really underpenetrated and there's lots of Telecom spend in which to grow our business at the household level. Sure. And ultimately price -- what you can do with price is a function of what costs are, and we have lowered costs. And the term, it's all [Indiscernible] is so low relative to the sort of trend that it's hard to attributed it all. So, Doug, I wouldn't say broadband is mature in the sense that, we think high capacity broadband, which we sell and packaged with mobility and packaged with great home connectivity, and managed Wi - Fi. Is still a growth opportunity in two ways. You have, what will the number of people that ultimately take that level of service be. And in our footprint today, we think 93% of houses are occupied. And I think the penetration of any kind of Internet service in that footprint is about 85%. So there's still opportunity to grow the overall connectivity broadband market. And then there's the opportunity to actually grow it into the high capacity service that we sell and high-quality service we sell. So we think that while we have 55% penetration, there's 37% penetration more to go in terms of what other possibilities are there. Plus the whole broadband -- mobile broadband platform as well and which grew very under penetrated. You can answer. Yes. So from a streaming perspective, it's interesting Charter's actually the biggest live-streaming app in the country and the most highly rated app in the country. We distribute streaming products on Roku, Apple TV, on our own set-top boxes. We've got the cloud-based streaming application that can be placed on our app-based streaming app system that can be placed right on our set-top boxes. And so we've got more than 10 million customers who are connected to us strictly through a streaming relationship. And we like the Comcast strategy with regard to their -- putting their platform on televisions. And so, we think there's lots of opportunity for us to continue to change the video model and to take advantage of our relationship with customers and to make the video model more efficient for programmers and for operators, and to bring value back into television."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Now let's turn to our results on Slide 5. We will continue to reference the COVID schedules we provided last year and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with year-over-year financial comparisons. Total residential and SMB customer relationships by 185,000 in the third quarter and by 1 million in the last 12 months. Including residential and SMB, we grew our internet customers by 265,000 in the quarter and by 1.3 million or 4.4% over the last 12 months. Video declined by a 121,000 in the third quarter. Wireline voice declined by 216,000 and we added 244,000 mobile lines in the quarter. As of the end of the quarter, we had 3.2 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality attractively - priced service, rather than using device subsidies. Moving to our financial results starting on slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by over 900,000 or 3.2%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 5.6% year-over-year, given last year's third quarter residential revenue adjustment of 218 million per sports network credits that we provided to video customers, as well as promotional rates step-ups, video rate adjustments that passed through programmer rate increases and a greater mix of longer tenured customers. Those were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we have seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of choice essentials and stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 9.4% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth in last year's COVID impacts. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 7.5%. This growth rate reflects COVID related impacts of $11 million that negatively impacted the third quarter of 2020, excluding this impact from last year SMB revenue grew by 6.3% faster than the second quarter growth when making the same COVID related adjustment. Enterprise revenue was up 6.4% year-over-year and included some one-time fees which were a benefit in this quarter. Excluding the benefit from this year, enterprise revenue grew by 3.8% and by 6.5% when additionally excluding all wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.5% year-over-year. Third quarter advertising revenue declined 15.1% year-over-year, primarily due to less political revenue in 2021, partially offset by COVID impact last year. When compared to the third quarter of 2019, advertising revenue declined by 0.8%, primarily due to local ad revenue, particularly auto, mostly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Excluding auto, the third quarter advertising grew by 8% over the third quarter of 2019. Mobile revenue totaled 535 million, with 201 million of that revenue being device revenue, and other revenue grew by 6.5% year-over-year. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 9.2% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7, in Q3, total operating expenses grew by 460 million or 6.2% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 9.4% year-over-year due to last year's third quarter benefit of 163 million related to sports network rebates and higher programming rates. These factors were partially offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages such as choice, essentials, and stream. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 3.5%, primarily driven by higher regulatory and franchise fees and video CPE s sold to the customers. Cost to service customer's were essentially flat year-over-year compared to 3.3% customer relationship growth, excluding bad debt, cost-to-service customers declined by 2.8% year-over-year. And that's despite a higher number of customers and outsize hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Bad debt was higher by $47 million year-over-year, but still nearly $75 million were lower when compared to the third quarter of 2019. Marketing expenses were also flat year-over-year, primarily driven by the lower sales environment. Mobile expenses totaled $607 million and were comprised at mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition, and service and operating costs, and other expenses grew by 3.8%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs, partially offset by lower advertising sales expense year-over-year, given the absence of political revenue this year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13.9% in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter versus 814 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Training to Slide 9, capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the third quarter below last year's third quarter spend of 2 billion driven by lower scalable infrastructure spend primarily due to a stabilized level of network traffic growth at investments made earlier this year. a decrease in line extension spend driven by housing built delays due to supply chain constraints in the housing industry and lower support capital primarily due to timing. We spent $119 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital, and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full-year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. As slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of $722 million or 41.2% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.9 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest pro forma for financing activity completed in October is $4.1 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our net debt to last 12 month adjusted EBITDA was 4.32 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.3 million Charter shares in Charter holdings, common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $753 per share. Year-to-date, we've purchased $12 billion of our stock in common unit and since September of 2016, we have repurchased $51.4 billion or 37.5% of Charter's equity at an average price of $436 per share. Our results show that even in this unusual environment, our flexible and robust business and service model, which benefits economically from lower customer transaction activity still drives outstanding EBITDA and free cash flow. Coupling that with our unique balance sheet structure and a proven capital allocation strategy, we will continue to produce shareholder value for years to come. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yeah. So first I'd point you back to Citi share and the COVID picture that there is a big piece of the year-over-year ARPU increase that's related to the revenue credits in Q3 of last year. But I do you think you pointed out something, the lower churn environment benefits us in a large number of ways. And one of those is on the ARPU side. The longer that a customer stays with idea of more customers [Indiscernible] roll off of promotional packages and therefore roll into higher pricing packages. And we have a low churn environment where you have additional longer tenured customers. We do see some impact on ARPU from that. The other pieces in there that you pointed out is the additional programmers sort of pass-through costs that we pushed at the end of the quarter. So there's a mix of the three. There will -- I think if we continue to be in the low Churn Environment, continue to be some ARPU impact. Just having longer tenured customers in the system. And the financial results of having those customers in the system for longer really are very good both on the revenue and the transactions side which is some of what you see. And in the overall financial results for the quarter. So -- I guess -- okay, we've seen that in the sense that you come in during the yields are actually going up. So the number of sales that come in that we are able to close and convert to customers has been increasing. I haven't it looked at it exactly. And Chris. Thank you. If you look at our total opportunity relative to customer spend on combined mobile and broadband, there's a lot of broadband spend -- a lot of mobile spend out there relative to broadband spend. So if you think about a customer, typical two-line household, they might be spending a total of $200 on broadband and mobile. And today, we're only getting a relatively small piece of that. And so if we continue to sell mobile product, even if we do it by bringing the pricing of mobile down, our expectation is that we'll continue to drive both revenue growth and bottom line EBITDA growth from that business, all wall driving pricing down in the mobile industry. And from the perspective of our mobile business, even today, our mobile business is profitable if you take customer acquisition costs down. And like what we've done across our business, our goal is always to further penetrate the market. And so if we can increase our penetration of the mobile market and up more ongoing revenues and less customer acquisition costs, okay, not less, even with additional customer acquisition costs, we'll generate strong profits out of that business just by penetrating the market, sticking with our strategy of having very competitive pricing for our customers. On the video and voice losses front, I think that that one is just the impact of having the -- not having the level of broadband additions that we had in 2020. when you have a lot of broadband additions, we pulled through a lot of recent video in bundling there, in this lower gross add lower churn environment. It's just carried through of the prior trends. It's no overall change in trend."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning. Welcome to Charter's second quarter 2021 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update these segments or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And because churn continues to be so low, those trends are having a meaningful impact on our net additions and even larger impact on our financial growth rates. Our Commercial business also saw improvements in the second quarter. Small business sales were up versus second quarter of 2019, and enterprise sales continue to steadily improve. Advertising also improved with second quarter revenue exceeding second quarter 2019 levels, driven by our advanced advertising products. So our view is the economy is improving, and our business trajectory is normalizing. For the full quarter, we added over 330,000 customer relationships with customer growth of 4.2% year-over-year. We also added 400,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.5 million over the last year for year-over-year growth of 5.5%. We added 265,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 11.8% and our free cash flow by over $2 million year-over-year. We remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high quality products and service under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. We've spoken significantly about wireless convergence in the capital-efficient nature of our expanding network capabilities and products. A key piece of our strategy also includes treating service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their spectrum services and interactions with us, whenever and however they want. We are improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing a number of elements our customers feel and network operations groups can use. Those efforts improve the customer experience and the quality of our products, while reducing transactions with customers, lowering churn, extending average customer life and reducing costs. We've responded to digital and self-service trends in several ways. Today, over 20% of our residential relationship sales are generated through our online channel, with fully automated provisioning and installation scheduling and zero touch by Charter. And close to 85% of our sales take advantage of our self-installation program, reducing costs and driving higher customer satisfaction. Today, customers also choose the preferred meeting [ph] of interacting with us when they have questions or service issues, including digital chat, phone, online, in-person at one of our stores or via the Spectrum app. Our ability to avoid and manage network impairments has improved significantly over the last several years by using machine learning to pinpoint potential service degradation in real time and often, in advance, allowing us to avoid disruption altogether. We're now coupling that information with customer's preferred communications to proactively notify them of maintenance and restoration. Today, over 60% of our customers engage with us exclusively via digital means when they have a service question or issue. Customers that still want to interact with us via phone can do so, and service from our call centers continues to become more efficient, given new tools we're deploying which enhance our ability to properly answer questions and solve the first - for the first time, customer calls. And the fact that our call center workforce is US-based and fully in-sourced, with employees who have training and career paths here at Charter, enhances that. In aggregate, all of our efforts have reduced total customer transactions, including billing and service calls, repeat service calls, truck rolls and network impairments, all of which improved the quality of our products. We're executing well, yet we remain early in the process of optimizing our services product. So together with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customer's EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come. That confidence stems from a number of factors, including the demand for our connectivity products, including the long-term growth rate and usage on both wireline and wireless networks, our ability to deliver unique fully converged connectivity services, connectivity service package, while saving customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still low. From a passings perspective, we remain under-penetrated to our long-term opportunity. Finally, our capital efficient path to expand network capability improve the quality of our products in a manner that's more capital efficient than our competitors gives us a structural advantage to compete over the long term. Ultimately, our strategy is founded on the principle of providing superior services at highly competitive prices. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. Turning to our results on slide 5. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 1.3 million in the last 12 months and by over 330,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 400,000 in the quarter by 1.5 million or 5.5% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 50,000 in the second quarter, and wireline voice declined by 78,000. In residential Internet, we added a total of 365,000 customers in the quarter, higher than the 221,000 that we gained during the second quarter of 2019. Our residential video customers declined by 63,000 less than the loss of 150,000 we saw in the second quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 99,000 residential customers in the quarter, also less than the loss of 207,000 in the second quarter of 2019, and that was driven by continued fixed to mobile substitution. Turning to mobile. We added 265,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. A few things to keep in mind when reviewing this quarter's customer results. First, we estimate that 60,000 of our residential Internet net adds would not have occurred without the Emergency Broadband Benefit program, or EBD, which launched in May. These incremental Internet net adds had little impact on our video and voice net adds. Some of what we estimate as business-as-usual sales also enrolled in the EBD [ph] program, as did some of our existing customers. Those customers did not in add to our second quarter customer net adds. Our second quarter customer net adds also benefited from certain state-mandated moratoriums on Internet, video and voice disconnects. Internet benefited by about 40,000, with video and voice net additions also benefiting, but by loss. Some states have recently ended their moratoriums. So similar to our KAC customers last year, we will work with these customers to forgive portions of their bills and provide financing options to customers. And we expect to keep them as customers, same as we did with the KAC program. Looking at the bigger picture. Residential customer activity levels in the marketplace, including sales, churn and particularly non-pay churn, are taking a bit longer than we expected to return to normal levels. As a result, our first half 2021 financials have been better than we expected, driven by lower operating expense given lower transactions, significantly lower bad debt. We continue to expect transaction volume to pick up in the second half of this year, driving more selling opportunities in the market for cable and mobile, and we still expect full year Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. So the financial effects that we expected of a higher churn environment and expected higher sales for Charter as a share taker could accrue later in 2021 or even into 2022. Moving to financial results, starting on slide six. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.2 million or 4.1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1.8% year-over-year, given last years second quarter residential revenue write-down of $76 million for customers in the Keep Americans Connected program, as well as bill credits that we provided last year as part of the remote education offer, which provided 2 months of free Internet. Those one-time comparison benefits were partly offset by the same bundle and mixed trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. Slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 6.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 6%, and this growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $17 million that negatively impacted the second quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.2%, faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 5.1% year-over-year and was also negatively impacted last year by $18 million due to COVID credits. Excluding this impact from last year, enterprise revenue grew by 2% and by 5.8%, when additionally excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 3.7% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue increased by 65% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID impact last year. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, advertising revenue grew by 4%, primarily due to our growing advertising - advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by lower local add revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $519 million, with $214 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, second quarter revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on slide seven. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $575 million or 8% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 3.6% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as choice, essentials and stream. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 36.9%, driven by more Lakers games than normal this quarter given the delayed start to the NBA season combined with no Lakers or Dodger games expensed in the prior year due to COVID-19. Excluding sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 3.2% year-over-year. Cost to service customers declined by 1.2% year-over-year compared to 4.2% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs and lower bad debt, partly driven by government stimulus packages. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers was flat year-over-year despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Marketing expenses grew by 3.1% year-over-year, driven by second quarter 2020 COVID impacts, including lower media placement rates in 2020 and a payroll tax credit. Mobile devices totaled $586 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating cost. And other expenses grew by 13.5%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs and advertising sales expense given the strength of ad sales this quarter, combined with the weakness in the ad market in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.8% in the quarter. And turning to net income on slide eight. We generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $766 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to slide nine. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter capital spend, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. This was offset by lower spend on modems, routers and self-installation kits given the elevated sales volume in the second quarter of last year. We spent $124 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, just mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect cable capital expenditures, excluding the RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. Slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 10.8% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.5 million in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in July, is $4 billion, 4.0 to be exact. As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage range. In June, we converted Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units, which had a face value of $2.5 billion and paid a 6% coupon. They were converted into 9.3 million common partnership units, which means we no longer pay $150 million in preferred dividends per year. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $656 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $47 billion or 36% of Charter's equity at an average price of $421 per share. So we have a successful operating model and growth-oriented investment approach, which when coupled with the unique balance sheet structure and improving capital allocation strategy, has and will produce cash flow growth and shareholder value for years to come. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. I'm going to - instead of talking about broadband, which everybody wants to talk about, I want to ask about your other two big revenue drivers, wireless and business services. First, with business services, I think you said last quarter, the repricing is now largely over for the Time Warner Cable customers. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in business services? It looks like with particularly weak results from Verizon and AT&T that share gains may have meaningfully accelerated now in the wake of COVID. And then with CBRS and wireless, I wonder if you could just talk about how much traffic you think you can offload from the MVNO agreement. And what kind of time line do you think you'll be before you'll start to see those traffic reductions on your own network?\nChris Winfrey: So maybe I'll start with business. And then I take - Tom cover wireless. The - on the business service segment, you have to really distinguish between SMB and enterprise. So I'll start with what we're seeing in SMB and then with enterprise. And for SMB, as businesses recover, new businesses open and the share flow opportunity for us is growing, and you see us returning to higher growth rates. And at the same time, most of the repricing in the SMB space at the legacy TWC base is behind us with the exception of the voice product. So it's largely behind. So what you're seeing is accelerating net add growth accompanied by less price pressure, which is resulting in accelerating sequential revenue growth in SMB. And we're steadily marching down a path to continue to go higher on both. And I think the runway for us on SMB continues to be very long, even though we're - we have a meaningful percentage and participation in that marketplace. On the enterprise side, we're lower penetrated, and our value-added opportunity is due to our significant amount of deployed fiber throughout our footprint to be able to drive connectivity services, as well as software-defined network overlay products, including SD-WAN, Unified Communications. And so our opportunity there is not only to provide more fiber connectivity, but to establish ourselves in the marketplace for these additional services and increase the stickiness of our fiber connectivity with additional product, and we're early on in that. That marketplace had really slowed down significantly during COVID. And our selling activity is back and above 2019 levels, despite the fact that certain key markets of ours, L.A., New York City, are not back to where they were. So despite that, we're above where we were in 2019, both from a units, as well as our revenue takeout on selling. What you're not seeing is the full impact of that yet inside of our revenue for enterprise because those sales have long time to installation and therefore, revenue conversion into billing. So our outlook on that is pretty strong. It's going to continue slowly, but continually get better and better in the enterprise space. But we're optimistic about both SMB and enterprise. And I think we can be a share taker there for many years to come.\nTom Rutledge: Yeah. And Craig, with regard to CBRS and offload, we have our first infrastructure project that we're building that will use CBRS that won't be active until early next year. And I don't anticipate any meaningful national offload until beginning in '23. But that said, we - it is a long-term opportunity, and we're a nascent player in the mobile space and just beginning our acceleration. And we're incented to move significant amounts of traffic onto our own network, and we already do through our Wi-Fi network, which we can also optimize for traffic flow going forward. And we can do the same with CBRS and potentially other parties as well. So we have a opportunity to continuously lower our cost going forward and to - even if we were not using CBRS, we have an opportunity just through our volume of activity to continuously move down the price curve. So we're optimistic about our ability to grow our mobile business and at the same time, take costs out of our mobile business as it grows. And there are a variety of tools, including CBRS, that allow us to do that. But I would say that, without giving you an exact number, it would be material.\nCraig Moffett: Fine. That's helpful. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thank you. Chris, I'm wondering if you can give us an update on when you think you'll switch from splitting nodes to potentially adding capacity to the plant with maybe an upgrade to 1.2 gigahertz with a high split. And if that happens later this year, is that contained within the CapEx envelope that you've guided to for the year? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: So I'll start off and let Tom add into it. I don't think it's going to be - one, we haven't announced a definitive plan as of yet to if and when we're moving into a high split territory. It's not going be like you're going to flip the switch nationally, you'll start off market-by-market. And it's not going to be heavy inside of this year in any event. So I don't think it's going to have any material impact to our CapEx this year. As you look out over a 5, 6-year period, really what you would be doing is using high split to replace augmentation that you'd be doing otherwise to increase the capacity of our network. And so when you look at it over a 5 to 6-year time period, it would be at very low, if any, incremental cost. There may be pockets in that 5 to 6-year window where you'd be doing effectively capital pull forward. And I'd like to use the word lumpiness you might have in some of your capital expenditure. But we're going to do what's right. And if we can move fast and get additional augmentation and capacity, we'd do it. But I don't see a material impact this year and over 5 to 6-year period. I don't think it changes the trajectory of our investment cycle. It give us additional capabilities, additional speeds at a lower cost than what we'd otherwise incur.\nTom Rutledge: The only thing I would add is the one thing it does, it gives you the ability to sell symmetrical data speeds at over a gig. And you can do that without really spending out much incremental capital. And at the moment, we really don't need that from a market facing perspective or from - I mean there's a perception issue in the market, but in terms of product use, there's none. And so we don't need it yet from a marketing perspective. And it's not the only tool in our toolbox. We have other technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0 and Full-Duplex, which we can use selectively and efficiently wherever augmentation or product definitions require. But I think the main thing to keep in mind is that, pathway we have to continuously upgrade our network capabilities is very efficient from a capital perspective and flexible.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. Kavita [ph] we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi.\nTom Rutledge: Michael, you might be on mute. There you go.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Good morning. Curious if you could talk a bit more about what you're seeing in the broadband market and your performance in terms of just overall market expansion versus market share. And then separately, on the video side, can you share what you find is contributing to the better trend line of video losses? And how you see that going forward? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Michael, I think the broadband market continues to expand, both through housing growth, population growth and adoption. The big issue in general adoption is more of a digital literacy issue than it is a cost issue. And it's continuing to improve in terms of market adoption because of the way people can use the tools on the Internet today, at any level and at any age. And so I think you have a continuous march of a broadband adoption right up to occupied housing over the next 5 years. And so you have that and then you have our ability to have a superior service with a capitally efficient ability to continuously upgrade that service. And we think we can - with a full range of products, including mobile and video, and we think we can continue to take share as a result of our ability to have high quality, low cost products available to consumers across the marketplace. With regard to video, why do we - why our number is relatively better? We're selling more packages that allow us to tailor video to customer needs. It's a difficult business because in general, video is very expensive. Our cost for video to provide it to customers are very high and continuously going up. And so there's people being priced out of the market. We put lower-priced packages into the market. The new products that have been developed direct-to-consumer products are churning at higher levels. And so our products also are in that re-adoption process of - that occurs as a result of churn. So to some extent, we think our video business is stabilizing, but at the other - on the other hand, the fundamental trends haven't stopped, which is that prices are being continuously passed through to consumers, and there's real pressure on the total cost of the bundle. The reason we're relatively better as we have, we've been moderate with our pricing, and we've been moderate, and we've created new packages that cost less.\nMichael Rollins: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Hey. Good morning, guys. Two questions. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about wireless sell-in. I don't know if you'd be willing to give us a number on percentage of new customers or connects that are taking wireless or any trends you're seeing or your ambitions long term? It would seem like that business is really starting to get a lot of momentum. And I was wondering if all your sales channels are turned on and just sort of how to think about the potential acceleration of that business, I think, you could share would be helpful. And then probably for Chris. Chris, just as we think about the third quarter broadband net adds, do we need to think about anything as it relates to either the EBB number you called out or the New York order, like definitely we need to factor in, in our thought process for third quarter? Or any thoughts would be appreciated.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. I'll take a crack at both of those, and then Tom may want to add additional. And on the wireless selling, so we're - the answer is no, we're not going to give you the percentage of selling for obvious competitive reasons, but I can provide some color on it. We're essentially selling through all of our channels. It is a focus we have to make sure that on every conversation that we have inside of our selling channels that we're bringing up the conversation to how we can save customers money if they take mobile with us. Our sales success rate, our compliance for that conversation taking place and the sales success rate is going up. And what happened inside of Q2 and also inside of Q1 is we just have less selling opportunities, but our success rate in selling in is going up on the steady march across all of those channels, which includes retention, by the way. So in all of our sales channels, and we're using it as a retention tool as well. Customers call in and want to save money. This is a great way to save hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year for a customer by taking your mobile product. So it's working well, and we have a lot of confidence that it's going to keep on increasing. And as soon as the market flow opens back up in terms of selling opportunities, I think we're well positioned. And the Q3 broadband, I don't expect EBB to have any negative impact on us in Q3. The customers that were protected from the state mandate perspective, we've already - inside of our Q2 results, it was small, but we've written off a portion of their balances. We're working with those customers. We've been successful in keeping those customers, those type of customers to the Keep Americans Connected programs. We'd want those customers to stay with us, and we're working with them to make sure that takes place. And it's worked in the past, and I don't expect any major impact there. I guess the only thing that I would say and - well, two things I would say about Q3, and not so much even Q3 is just when you think about the coming quarters. Q2 2019 wasn't our strongest quarter. So we've really outpaced that this quarter versus 2019. And I think Q3 2019 was better than Q2 2019. So I'd just caution not to get over your SKUs [ph] on relative expansion of net adds and comparison to 2019. And there will be a moment where - we were just talking about it yesterday. There will be a moment where there's dislocation where the market churn picks up, your sales should pick up. And so there's always this question of does the timing line up exactly right. As a share taker over a period of time, that means we're going to have higher sales and we're going to have higher net adds. But in order to get there, the market churn rate has to pick up. And there's a timing question of does it all flow through inside of the quarter the way they think it should. And so I - what we always say, I wouldn't pay too much attention to a particular quarter. Our growth rate is good. It's going to continue to be good, and we tend to look over longer periods of time, as opposed to just a particular quarter.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. Thanks, Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Yeah.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. First question, one clarification. Did you say that CapEx this year would be, I think, stable including RDOF or excluding RDOF, because I think the press release said excluding RDOF?\nChris Winfrey: Excluding RDOF.\nDoug Mitchelson: Okay. For some reason, I thought I heard including, which would have been a surprise.\nChris Winfrey: Yes.\nDoug Mitchelson: I'm just - a question on wireless on the go-to-market strategy and the position and look, you've been pretty clear on not offering phone subsidies, which obviously is somewhat self-limiting for subscriber growth. Are you already leveraging all of your marketing channels for wireless? Is the elbow grease putting into driving gross additions, something that we could consider as relatively stable over time. I mean as we see our scale forward, it's partly selling opportunities, as you indicated, and it's partly churn on a growing subscriber base, and that's how we run the subscriber model. Or should we think of this as more of a financial decision as the economics of the business improve either through scale or learnings and operating smarter or offload on CBRS and Wi-Fi? As the economics of the business improve, should we assume that you'll spend more on market and ultimately consider phone subsidies? Just trying to understand that top of funnel approach over the next bunch of years for wireless? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Yeah. Doug, we haven't fully deployed all of our channels. We have a store strategy that's multi-year, and that's still rolling out. And we expect to complete it by the end of this year, but a substantial portion of our stores are not done. And so even the channels that we wanted to deploy are not fully rolled out. But we have a variety of tools to grow our market share. And we have - and I would not preclude any of them that anybody else has ever used in history. But fundamentally, we haven't changed our pricing since we launched the product. And we have that ability to be - to move the needle in terms of the amount of mobile customers that we create as part of our broadband strategy. So I would say that we set up a strategy that was based on activity levels. Those activity levels are lower than we thought because churn is lower than we thought. But there's - there are more ways to get into the market than we are using.\nChris Winfrey: And I'd just add, since you asked the question, is it - are there financial decisions driving how aggressive we are is the essence of what you're asking, the answer is no. We have a lot of confidence. We know what the economics are. They're very good of what we're doing. And overtime, it's not a short term financially driven decision in terms of how we deploy those channels.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Very helpful. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Doug. Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hey, guys. A couple of follow-ups. Maybe expand on the comment about business trajectory normalizing. Was that improving through the second quarter or since? And is your own churn starting to pick up as well? And then on mobile CapEx, as store spending comes to an end, do you expect mobile spend from those traditional uses to fall? And how could your strand mount [ph] spend to come in relative to that in maybe '22 or '23? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Look, I don't think ever want to go down the heavy path of the intra-quarter trajectory. SMB has been steadily improving each quarter. You can see it in our results. Enterprise, clearly, as more businesses become occupied, which is still relatively low, the selling opportunity for us increases and the willingness for people to take decisions on their IT network, including our services increases. So a lot of that's really been moving with COVID and in office occupancy as people are making decisions, and that's going to continue to - that has been improving steadily. And - but for what you're seeing in newspaper, I think we'll continue to steadily improve. So enterprise selling opportunities should continue to get better. Your question - go ahead.\nTom Rutledge: Well, I was just going to say that in terms of churn, fundamentally, recovery is slower than we thought it would be in terms of activity levels. And while we're performing well in all of that, it's not what we thought. So we're a little surprised at how slow move activity has rebounded. And so I'm - it is rebounded. Everything is moving and increasing and returning to normal. But it is not there, and it's still an unusual marketplace.\nChris Winfrey: On the CapEx side, the stores that we plan to roll out will be largely completed this year. Some of that's going to roll little bit into next year. And then we have another investment decision to make of how we're deeply penetrated in the market we want to go, we've not made that decision yet. We'll take a similar ROI approach to how we deal with that in stores, but our original plan will be complete, largely end of this year as Tom said, and maybe a little carryover into next year. You rightfully point out that we'll be stepping up the CBRS investment. And could that take the place of store capital? Yes, but not into perpetuity, I think. So it may have been you who published.\nTom Rutledge: That's not the way we think about it.\nChris Winfrey: It's not the way that all we think about. It just happens to be some coincidence. But I think you had [indiscernible] published a number that was relatively high for what we would spend on \u2013 that number that NBC told to me is a multibillion dollar number, and that's way more than what this project is going to cost. And that will be ROI-based. We don't have a specific time line other than we'll roll out market-by-market based on where we have the best ROI to achieve that. But the capital spending is - it's large. But in the overall context of Charter, it's not that big.\nPhil Cusick: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. Kavita, next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik with UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks, guys. During the quarter, you signed a new affiliate agreement with Viacom. And it seems like the wording has changed a bit. So anything you could tell us about, maybe not a specific deal, but just affiliate deals in general? Are you getting more flexibility? As you are more sort of B2C participation because there's obviously fewer blackouts and so that seemingly, the negotiations are going better. So just any evolution there that you're seeing. And then going back a couple of years, you guys talked about 500 basis points or so of sort of visibility on margin improvement. And in the prepared remarks, you talked about all the digitalization and efforts there that should sort of keep that trend going. But just in some - any change in your visibility for margin improvement from the sort of 39% levels as you look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: John, with regard to Viacom, I would say this, it was a modern agreement, a new agreement and recognized that the video business is changing, and it addressed our legacy relationship and addressed our new direct-to-consumer relationship with Viacom. And they were, I think, happy with the discussion, and we were obviously since we agreed to it. And the - it's different than prior agreements because they have direct-to-consumer products, and those were integral to the discussion. And consistent with our view that we'd like to be part of the marketplace and to enhance our video and customer relationship with customers through managing transactions for them. So it did that.\nChris Winfrey: On the margin, I think you know us well enough, John, that we don't think about the business in terms of percentage margin terms. It doesn't drive how we do investment planning or operating plans or budgets. But the part of your question is, are we going to continue to get more efficient? And the answer is yes. I mean, you have double-digit percentage increases in the number of trouble calls and service calls per customer relationship year-over-year, and that continues. It has a long runway. I think the bigger driver for consolidated margin really is much more about revenue mix. So if you think about what we're doing, we're adding mobile in, which has a positive EBITDA on the increment, but it has a lower structural percentage margin, if you think about it that way. We use video and mobile to drive higher attach rates for broadband, which is a high growth margin. We use it to drive higher retention of broadband. So we use lower stand-alone margin products to drive higher-margin acquisition and retention. And at the end of the day, that's not at all how we think about the mix. What we're thinking about is how can we create the most value in the household to drive the most products going in that gets the most EBITDA and the most cash flow per household. And so you could have a low revenue business with a high percentage margin and have this victory lap of high percentage margin, but you could have lower EBITDA and lower cash flow per household, and that's not the model that we deploy. So we're looking to put as much product in much value and to get as much EBITDA and cash flow out of the household by providing products that - and packages that our customers can't replicate and make it easy to - for customers to stay with us for a long period of time. So I don't want to give a guidance on where margin is going, other than it's going to be much more of a function of our lower video losses, continued growth in mobile, continued growth in Internet, which goes the opposite direction. But the biggest thing to focus on us is free cash flow and free cash flow per share.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thanks, Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Yeah.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, John. Excuse me, Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Cahall, Wells Fargo.\nSteven Cahall: Thanks. Could you maybe talk about costs a little bit, both in the P&L and in CapEx in the back half of the year? You mentioned some of the labor cost increases? And I know labor is also a big piece of CapEx and especially with a strong selling environment. Just how should we think about cost growth in the back half of the year? And then on share repurchase, you're annualizing to a pretty big share repurchase here. I know you don't guide on it. I'm just curious if you could talk about what informed your thinking on share repurchase in the first half of the year and if there's anything that's shifting as we move into the back half of the year? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. And the cost commentary, if you go back after the call, take a look at the prepared remarks, what I was trying to make clear is as the - as churn returns into the marketplace, that will give us better selling opportunities, which should ultimately lead to net adds. Some of that will be timing driven, but - as I talked about earlier. But it's going to increase our sales commissions. It's going to increase the number of installations that we do, which has OpEx into, a lesser extent, CapEx. And it will increase the number of newer tenured customers who tend to call more frequently at the beginning. So operating cost and a higher transaction environment and higher churn environment move up. And in some sense, that's what we're hoping for is that we'll have OpEx pressure because our sales will be accelerating and our net adds would be higher, and it's not in the environment that we've been in the first half. And so we'll just do a good job of explaining that as it's taking place. But we've been trying to condition people from that environment since the beginning of the year, and it's happening later than we expected and may continue to push out. The other item that in the cost category of the bad debt, which goes along if you're non-pay. And it also attaches to - it's driven as well by people just moving and term [ph] generally. And the CapEx is less impacted. From a volume standpoint, yes, you'll have a little bit more CP purchase. You'll have a little bit more capitalized install, but it doesn't move around quite as rapidly in that environment as you'd see in OpEx. On share repurchase, we've been targeting a leverage to be at the mid to high end of our target leverage range. And so the buybacks, we think about the long-term value of Charter, and we think it's high. And so really, when we look at buybacks, it's more about the target leverage range target, as opposed to trying to be opportunistic for not day triggers. We have a good long-term view on the value of Charter. And so our buyback is much more informed [ph] by the target leverage, target leverage where we expect to be at the end of the year.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Yeah.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Steven. Kavita, we'll take our next question, please?\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I guess two separate questions. On - Comcast has flexed in the market for quite a while. And Altice recently announced their own streaming hardware. Are you planning on introducing anything similar for your customer base? And if you are, would you build it or potentially license flex from Comcast? Or how are you thinking about it? And then separately, can you - you've called out advanced advertising or addressable everything a number of times as a driver and you've always been an industry leader in this area. Can you give us some color on current initiatives? And where you see it going?\nTom Rutledge: Jessica, with regard to our IP box solution, we've got a bunch of techniques and market facing IT strategies. One is that we have an app-based user interface, and a lot of our customers bring their own hardware and use our apps and get their MVPD service in that way from us. We also have the existing world box that we've deployed to our customer base. And in that world box is an IP platform. And we have - we are beginning to put apps, Netflix, YouTube and other apps on to our existing set-top box. And we continue to engage with Comcast on a discussion about their flex technology and what it might be are capable of doing for us.\nChris Winfrey: And I'll take the advertising question and then add, if needed. The - David Klein appreciates your complement to the industry-leading, I'm sure, Jessica. But the driver here is we've really had an enhanced ability to sell the long-tail inventory and be able to monetize what was previously not utilized. And we have a tool that's called Audience App. Because we have all of the set-top box data in an aggregated anonymized way for all of our customer base. We have the ability to present that to buyers of advertising and sell the long-tail inventory in a way that you were never able to do because Nielsen doesn't go very deep. And so we can sell that on a zone basis. We can sell it on a split-avail basis, addressable. And we can really effectively guarantee a buyer impressions across not just the traditional set-top box base, but clearly, through the increasing amount of IP-based viewing that we have off a Spectrum TV app, which is on Apple TV, on Roku and Samsung TV and all these other devices, iOS devices, Android and really monetize those impressions and monetize the set-top box inventory in a very similar way. So I do think that we're leading the charge of moving the entire advertising space to an impression-based viewing and being able to show it to the buyer where across all of the different channels that they can get placement and to be able to validate and verify on the back end that those eyeballs were actually captured and that they had a good return. We've also been investing in addition to more forward thinking areas like addressability which we're selling, split avails, which we have capabilities on, but also moving into using everything that I just described before, moving into attribution as well. And that's the Holy Grail here of being able to sell and then to go back and - or take a lead to the customer what exactly it drove in terms of sales for them. So we have a fully - full set of advertising capabilities that we offer to a client, super local when needed, addressable when needed. And we do it in traditional set-top box impression-based viewing and digital, which we sell as well. So despite the fact that the local ad sales market isn't all the way back, it's actually down relative to 2019. Certain segments like auto aren't performing as well because they don't have a lot of inventory. But despite that, our overall ad sales are up versus 2019, primarily driven by all the different capabilities that I described and the ability to make use of inventory that wasn't previously monetized.\nTom Rutledge: At higher CPMs.\nChris Winfrey: At higher CPMs. It gives us more value.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Can you license that across the industry or volume?\nChris Winfrey: I think you went soft, but I think you asked if we could license that across the industry. We're always open to revenue opportunities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks\u2026\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jessica. Kavita, we'll take our last question, please?\nOperator: Your last question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. Wanted to ask a couple, if I could. In broad strokes, following up with the last question, can you talk about how the agreements you're reaching with programmers to carry their streaming services, provide you with ad inventory that you can monetize in the future as you gain scale there? And then secondly, I just wanted to see if you could comment on what you're seeing in terms of any incremental competitive fiber-to-the-home expansion in your footprint and or fixed wireless? Is there anything observable there? Or is it pretty much business as usual? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well, I think your last question on competition, we continue to see a similar marketplace that we've seen for a number of years now in terms of competitive overbuilds. We're continuing to do well everywhere we operate, and we are the share leader everywhere we operate competitively speaking. The - with regard to programmers, yes, there's an opportunity depending on the model, either for an advertising sale in the app and at multiple levels and the transaction opportunity as well in creating new subscriptions. So I guess the short answer is yes.\nBryan Kraft: Is - and Tom, maybe just to follow-up there. As you - it sounds like you're building some of these revenue streams now as the apps available through your current set-top box infrastructure, as you shift to sort of your next gen, whether it's Flex or something else, do you see those opportunities kind of ending significantly or..\nTom Rutledge: Yes, I do. I think there's an opportunity to have a better advertising business than we've had historically. That works better for advertisers. It's more direct. It's got attribution. And we have a large skilled sales force on the streets, in the cities that we operate. So yes, I think it's an opportunity to create increased revenue.\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Bryan. And thanks to everyone. We will see you next quarter.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you very much.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. As we discussed last quarter, given the effects of COVID in 2020, 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021. We'll continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year and included again on slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. Turning to our results on slide 5. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 1.3 million in the last 12 months and by over 330,000 in the second quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 400,000 in the quarter by 1.5 million or 5.5% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 50,000 in the second quarter, and wireline voice declined by 78,000. In residential Internet, we added a total of 365,000 customers in the quarter, higher than the 221,000 that we gained during the second quarter of 2019. Our residential video customers declined by 63,000 less than the loss of 150,000 we saw in the second quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 99,000 residential customers in the quarter, also less than the loss of 207,000 in the second quarter of 2019, and that was driven by continued fixed to mobile substitution. Turning to mobile. We added 265,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.9 million mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from cable sales, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high quality, attractively priced service rather than using device subsidies. A few things to keep in mind when reviewing this quarter's customer results. First, we estimate that 60,000 of our residential Internet net adds would not have occurred without the Emergency Broadband Benefit program, or EBD, which launched in May. These incremental Internet net adds had little impact on our video and voice net adds. Some of what we estimate as business-as-usual sales also enrolled in the EBD [ph] program, as did some of our existing customers. Those customers did not in add to our second quarter customer net adds. Our second quarter customer net adds also benefited from certain state-mandated moratoriums on Internet, video and voice disconnects. Internet benefited by about 40,000, with video and voice net additions also benefiting, but by loss. Some states have recently ended their moratoriums. So similar to our KAC customers last year, we will work with these customers to forgive portions of their bills and provide financing options to customers. And we expect to keep them as customers, same as we did with the KAC program. Looking at the bigger picture. Residential customer activity levels in the marketplace, including sales, churn and particularly non-pay churn, are taking a bit longer than we expected to return to normal levels. As a result, our first half 2021 financials have been better than we expected, driven by lower operating expense given lower transactions, significantly lower bad debt. We continue to expect transaction volume to pick up in the second half of this year, driving more selling opportunities in the market for cable and mobile, and we still expect full year Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. So the financial effects that we expected of a higher churn environment and expected higher sales for Charter as a share taker could accrue later in 2021 or even into 2022. Moving to financial results, starting on slide six. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.2 million or 4.1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1.8% year-over-year, given last years second quarter residential revenue write-down of $76 million for customers in the Keep Americans Connected program, as well as bill credits that we provided last year as part of the remote education offer, which provided 2 months of free Internet. Those one-time comparison benefits were partly offset by the same bundle and mixed trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. Slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 6.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth and last year's COVID impacts. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 6%, and this growth rate reflects COVID-related impacts of $17 million that negatively impacted the second quarter of 2020. Excluding this impact from last year, SMB revenue grew by 4.2%, faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 5.1% year-over-year and was also negatively impacted last year by $18 million due to COVID credits. Excluding this impact from last year, enterprise revenue grew by 2% and by 5.8%, when additionally excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 3.7% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue increased by 65% year-over-year, primarily due to COVID impact last year. When compared to the second quarter of 2019, advertising revenue grew by 4%, primarily due to our growing advertising - advanced advertising capabilities, partly offset by lower local add revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $519 million, with $214 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, second quarter revenue was up 9.5% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on slide seven. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $575 million or 8% year-over-year. Similar to revenue, the year-over-year operating expense growth rate is elevated due to 2020 COVID effects. Programming increased 3.6% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as choice, essentials and stream. Regulatory, connectivity and produced content grew by 36.9%, driven by more Lakers games than normal this quarter given the delayed start to the NBA season combined with no Lakers or Dodger games expensed in the prior year due to COVID-19. Excluding sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 3.2% year-over-year. Cost to service customers declined by 1.2% year-over-year compared to 4.2% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by lower transaction costs and lower bad debt, partly driven by government stimulus packages. Excluding bad debt, cost to service customers was flat year-over-year despite a higher number of customers and outsized hourly wage increases that we put through earlier this year. Marketing expenses grew by 3.1% year-over-year, driven by second quarter 2020 COVID impacts, including lower media placement rates in 2020 and a payroll tax credit. Mobile devices totaled $586 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating cost. And other expenses grew by 13.5%, driven primarily by higher corporate costs and advertising sales expense given the strength of ad sales this quarter, combined with the weakness in the ad market in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 11.8% in the quarter. And turning to net income on slide eight. We generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $766 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to slide nine. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter capital spend, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. This was offset by lower spend on modems, routers and self-installation kits given the elevated sales volume in the second quarter of last year. We spent $124 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, just mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect cable capital expenditures, excluding the RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. Slide 10 shows, we generated nearly $2.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 10.8% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $87.5 million in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in July, is $4 billion, 4.0 to be exact. As of the end of the second quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times leverage range. In June, we converted Advance/Newhouse's preferred partnership units, which had a face value of $2.5 billion and paid a 6% coupon. They were converted into 9.3 million common partnership units, which means we no longer pay $150 million in preferred dividends per year. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.1 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $656 per share. Since September of 2016, we've repurchased $47 billion or 36% of Charter's equity at an average price of $421 per share. So we have a successful operating model and growth-oriented investment approach, which when coupled with the unique balance sheet structure and improving capital allocation strategy, has and will produce cash flow growth and shareholder value for years to come. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. So maybe I'll start with business. And then I take - Tom cover wireless. The - on the business service segment, you have to really distinguish between SMB and enterprise. So I'll start with what we're seeing in SMB and then with enterprise. And for SMB, as businesses recover, new businesses open and the share flow opportunity for us is growing, and you see us returning to higher growth rates. And at the same time, most of the repricing in the SMB space at the legacy TWC base is behind us with the exception of the voice product. So it's largely behind. So what you're seeing is accelerating net add growth accompanied by less price pressure, which is resulting in accelerating sequential revenue growth in SMB. And we're steadily marching down a path to continue to go higher on both. And I think the runway for us on SMB continues to be very long, even though we're - we have a meaningful percentage and participation in that marketplace. On the enterprise side, we're lower penetrated, and our value-added opportunity is due to our significant amount of deployed fiber throughout our footprint to be able to drive connectivity services, as well as software-defined network overlay products, including SD-WAN, Unified Communications. And so our opportunity there is not only to provide more fiber connectivity, but to establish ourselves in the marketplace for these additional services and increase the stickiness of our fiber connectivity with additional product, and we're early on in that. That marketplace had really slowed down significantly during COVID. And our selling activity is back and above 2019 levels, despite the fact that certain key markets of ours, L.A., New York City, are not back to where they were. So despite that, we're above where we were in 2019, both from a units, as well as our revenue takeout on selling. What you're not seeing is the full impact of that yet inside of our revenue for enterprise because those sales have long time to installation and therefore, revenue conversion into billing. So our outlook on that is pretty strong. It's going to continue slowly, but continually get better and better in the enterprise space. But we're optimistic about both SMB and enterprise. And I think we can be a share taker there for many years to come. So I'll start off and let Tom add into it. I don't think it's going to be - one, we haven't announced a definitive plan as of yet to if and when we're moving into a high split territory. It's not going be like you're going to flip the switch nationally, you'll start off market-by-market. And it's not going to be heavy inside of this year in any event. So I don't think it's going to have any material impact to our CapEx this year. As you look out over a 5, 6-year period, really what you would be doing is using high split to replace augmentation that you'd be doing otherwise to increase the capacity of our network. And so when you look at it over a 5 to 6-year time period, it would be at very low, if any, incremental cost. There may be pockets in that 5 to 6-year window where you'd be doing effectively capital pull forward. And I'd like to use the word lumpiness you might have in some of your capital expenditure. But we're going to do what's right. And if we can move fast and get additional augmentation and capacity, we'd do it. But I don't see a material impact this year and over 5 to 6-year period. I don't think it changes the trajectory of our investment cycle. It give us additional capabilities, additional speeds at a lower cost than what we'd otherwise incur. Sure. I'll take a crack at both of those, and then Tom may want to add additional. And on the wireless selling, so we're - the answer is no, we're not going to give you the percentage of selling for obvious competitive reasons, but I can provide some color on it. We're essentially selling through all of our channels. It is a focus we have to make sure that on every conversation that we have inside of our selling channels that we're bringing up the conversation to how we can save customers money if they take mobile with us. Our sales success rate, our compliance for that conversation taking place and the sales success rate is going up. And what happened inside of Q2 and also inside of Q1 is we just have less selling opportunities, but our success rate in selling in is going up on the steady march across all of those channels, which includes retention, by the way. So in all of our sales channels, and we're using it as a retention tool as well. Customers call in and want to save money. This is a great way to save hundreds and even thousands of dollars a year for a customer by taking your mobile product. So it's working well, and we have a lot of confidence that it's going to keep on increasing. And as soon as the market flow opens back up in terms of selling opportunities, I think we're well positioned. And the Q3 broadband, I don't expect EBB to have any negative impact on us in Q3. The customers that were protected from the state mandate perspective, we've already - inside of our Q2 results, it was small, but we've written off a portion of their balances. We're working with those customers. We've been successful in keeping those customers, those type of customers to the Keep Americans Connected programs. We'd want those customers to stay with us, and we're working with them to make sure that takes place. And it's worked in the past, and I don't expect any major impact there. I guess the only thing that I would say and - well, two things I would say about Q3, and not so much even Q3 is just when you think about the coming quarters. Q2 2019 wasn't our strongest quarter. So we've really outpaced that this quarter versus 2019. And I think Q3 2019 was better than Q2 2019. So I'd just caution not to get over your SKUs [ph] on relative expansion of net adds and comparison to 2019. And there will be a moment where - we were just talking about it yesterday. There will be a moment where there's dislocation where the market churn picks up, your sales should pick up. And so there's always this question of does the timing line up exactly right. As a share taker over a period of time, that means we're going to have higher sales and we're going to have higher net adds. But in order to get there, the market churn rate has to pick up. And there's a timing question of does it all flow through inside of the quarter the way they think it should. And so I - what we always say, I wouldn't pay too much attention to a particular quarter. Our growth rate is good. It's going to continue to be good, and we tend to look over longer periods of time, as opposed to just a particular quarter. Yeah. Excluding RDOF. Yes. And I'd just add, since you asked the question, is it - are there financial decisions driving how aggressive we are is the essence of what you're asking, the answer is no. We have a lot of confidence. We know what the economics are. They're very good of what we're doing. And overtime, it's not a short term financially driven decision in terms of how we deploy those channels. Look, I don't think ever want to go down the heavy path of the intra-quarter trajectory. SMB has been steadily improving each quarter. You can see it in our results. Enterprise, clearly, as more businesses become occupied, which is still relatively low, the selling opportunity for us increases and the willingness for people to take decisions on their IT network, including our services increases. So a lot of that's really been moving with COVID and in office occupancy as people are making decisions, and that's going to continue to - that has been improving steadily. And - but for what you're seeing in newspaper, I think we'll continue to steadily improve. So enterprise selling opportunities should continue to get better. Your question - go ahead. On the CapEx side, the stores that we plan to roll out will be largely completed this year. Some of that's going to roll little bit into next year. And then we have another investment decision to make of how we're deeply penetrated in the market we want to go, we've not made that decision yet. We'll take a similar ROI approach to how we deal with that in stores, but our original plan will be complete, largely end of this year as Tom said, and maybe a little carryover into next year. You rightfully point out that we'll be stepping up the CBRS investment. And could that take the place of store capital? Yes, but not into perpetuity, I think. So it may have been you who published. It's not the way that all we think about. It just happens to be some coincidence. But I think you had [indiscernible] published a number that was relatively high for what we would spend on \u2013 that number that NBC told to me is a multibillion dollar number, and that's way more than what this project is going to cost. And that will be ROI-based. We don't have a specific time line other than we'll roll out market-by-market based on where we have the best ROI to achieve that. But the capital spending is - it's large. But in the overall context of Charter, it's not that big. Thanks. On the margin, I think you know us well enough, John, that we don't think about the business in terms of percentage margin terms. It doesn't drive how we do investment planning or operating plans or budgets. But the part of your question is, are we going to continue to get more efficient? And the answer is yes. I mean, you have double-digit percentage increases in the number of trouble calls and service calls per customer relationship year-over-year, and that continues. It has a long runway. I think the bigger driver for consolidated margin really is much more about revenue mix. So if you think about what we're doing, we're adding mobile in, which has a positive EBITDA on the increment, but it has a lower structural percentage margin, if you think about it that way. We use video and mobile to drive higher attach rates for broadband, which is a high growth margin. We use it to drive higher retention of broadband. So we use lower stand-alone margin products to drive higher-margin acquisition and retention. And at the end of the day, that's not at all how we think about the mix. What we're thinking about is how can we create the most value in the household to drive the most products going in that gets the most EBITDA and the most cash flow per household. And so you could have a low revenue business with a high percentage margin and have this victory lap of high percentage margin, but you could have lower EBITDA and lower cash flow per household, and that's not the model that we deploy. So we're looking to put as much product in much value and to get as much EBITDA and cash flow out of the household by providing products that - and packages that our customers can't replicate and make it easy to - for customers to stay with us for a long period of time. So I don't want to give a guidance on where margin is going, other than it's going to be much more of a function of our lower video losses, continued growth in mobile, continued growth in Internet, which goes the opposite direction. But the biggest thing to focus on us is free cash flow and free cash flow per share. Yeah. Sure. And the cost commentary, if you go back after the call, take a look at the prepared remarks, what I was trying to make clear is as the - as churn returns into the marketplace, that will give us better selling opportunities, which should ultimately lead to net adds. Some of that will be timing driven, but - as I talked about earlier. But it's going to increase our sales commissions. It's going to increase the number of installations that we do, which has OpEx into, a lesser extent, CapEx. And it will increase the number of newer tenured customers who tend to call more frequently at the beginning. So operating cost and a higher transaction environment and higher churn environment move up. And in some sense, that's what we're hoping for is that we'll have OpEx pressure because our sales will be accelerating and our net adds would be higher, and it's not in the environment that we've been in the first half. And so we'll just do a good job of explaining that as it's taking place. But we've been trying to condition people from that environment since the beginning of the year, and it's happening later than we expected and may continue to push out. The other item that in the cost category of the bad debt, which goes along if you're non-pay. And it also attaches to - it's driven as well by people just moving and term [ph] generally. And the CapEx is less impacted. From a volume standpoint, yes, you'll have a little bit more CP purchase. You'll have a little bit more capitalized install, but it doesn't move around quite as rapidly in that environment as you'd see in OpEx. On share repurchase, we've been targeting a leverage to be at the mid to high end of our target leverage range. And so the buybacks, we think about the long-term value of Charter, and we think it's high. And so really, when we look at buybacks, it's more about the target leverage range target, as opposed to trying to be opportunistic for not day triggers. We have a good long-term view on the value of Charter. And so our buyback is much more informed [ph] by the target leverage, target leverage where we expect to be at the end of the year. Yeah. And I'll take the advertising question and then add, if needed. The - David Klein appreciates your complement to the industry-leading, I'm sure, Jessica. But the driver here is we've really had an enhanced ability to sell the long-tail inventory and be able to monetize what was previously not utilized. And we have a tool that's called Audience App. Because we have all of the set-top box data in an aggregated anonymized way for all of our customer base. We have the ability to present that to buyers of advertising and sell the long-tail inventory in a way that you were never able to do because Nielsen doesn't go very deep. And so we can sell that on a zone basis. We can sell it on a split-avail basis, addressable. And we can really effectively guarantee a buyer impressions across not just the traditional set-top box base, but clearly, through the increasing amount of IP-based viewing that we have off a Spectrum TV app, which is on Apple TV, on Roku and Samsung TV and all these other devices, iOS devices, Android and really monetize those impressions and monetize the set-top box inventory in a very similar way. So I do think that we're leading the charge of moving the entire advertising space to an impression-based viewing and being able to show it to the buyer where across all of the different channels that they can get placement and to be able to validate and verify on the back end that those eyeballs were actually captured and that they had a good return. We've also been investing in addition to more forward thinking areas like addressability which we're selling, split avails, which we have capabilities on, but also moving into using everything that I just described before, moving into attribution as well. And that's the Holy Grail here of being able to sell and then to go back and - or take a lead to the customer what exactly it drove in terms of sales for them. So we have a fully - full set of advertising capabilities that we offer to a client, super local when needed, addressable when needed. And we do it in traditional set-top box impression-based viewing and digital, which we sell as well. So despite the fact that the local ad sales market isn't all the way back, it's actually down relative to 2019. Certain segments like auto aren't performing as well because they don't have a lot of inventory. But despite that, our overall ad sales are up versus 2019, primarily driven by all the different capabilities that I described and the ability to make use of inventory that wasn't previously monetized. At higher CPMs. It gives us more value. I think you went soft, but I think you asked if we could license that across the industry. We're always open to revenue opportunities. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. Our operating strategy continues to deliver good customer growth and even better financial growth. While second quarter residential customer activity remained lower than normal, residential sales activity is slowly picking up. And because churn continues to be so low, those trends are having a meaningful impact on our net additions and even larger impact on our financial growth rates. Our Commercial business also saw improvements in the second quarter. Small business sales were up versus second quarter of 2019, and enterprise sales continue to steadily improve. Advertising also improved with second quarter revenue exceeding second quarter 2019 levels, driven by our advanced advertising products. So our view is the economy is improving, and our business trajectory is normalizing. For the full quarter, we added over 330,000 customer relationships with customer growth of 4.2% year-over-year. We also added 400,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 1.5 million over the last year for year-over-year growth of 5.5%. We added 265,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 11.8% and our free cash flow by over $2 million year-over-year. We remain focused on driving customer growth by offering high quality products and service under an operating strategy, which works well in various market conditions. We've spoken significantly about wireless convergence in the capital-efficient nature of our expanding network capabilities and products. A key piece of our strategy also includes treating service as a product itself and giving our customers the flexibility to manage their spectrum services and interactions with us, whenever and however they want. We are improving the quality and efficiency of our interactions with customers by expanding our customer self-service and self-care capabilities and digitizing and modernizing a number of elements our customers feel and network operations groups can use. Those efforts improve the customer experience and the quality of our products, while reducing transactions with customers, lowering churn, extending average customer life and reducing costs. We've responded to digital and self-service trends in several ways. Today, over 20% of our residential relationship sales are generated through our online channel, with fully automated provisioning and installation scheduling and zero touch by Charter. And close to 85% of our sales take advantage of our self-installation program, reducing costs and driving higher customer satisfaction. Today, customers also choose the preferred meeting [ph] of interacting with us when they have questions or service issues, including digital chat, phone, online, in-person at one of our stores or via the Spectrum app. Our ability to avoid and manage network impairments has improved significantly over the last several years by using machine learning to pinpoint potential service degradation in real time and often, in advance, allowing us to avoid disruption altogether. We're now coupling that information with customer's preferred communications to proactively notify them of maintenance and restoration. Today, over 60% of our customers engage with us exclusively via digital means when they have a service question or issue. Customers that still want to interact with us via phone can do so, and service from our call centers continues to become more efficient, given new tools we're deploying which enhance our ability to properly answer questions and solve the first - for the first time, customer calls. And the fact that our call center workforce is US-based and fully in-sourced, with employees who have training and career paths here at Charter, enhances that. In aggregate, all of our efforts have reduced total customer transactions, including billing and service calls, repeat service calls, truck rolls and network impairments, all of which improved the quality of our products. We're executing well, yet we remain early in the process of optimizing our services product. So together with our network and product capabilities, we remain confident in our ability to grow our customer's EBITDA and free cash flow for many years to come. That confidence stems from a number of factors, including the demand for our connectivity products, including the long-term growth rate and usage on both wireline and wireless networks, our ability to deliver unique fully converged connectivity services, connectivity service package, while saving customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still low. From a passings perspective, we remain under-penetrated to our long-term opportunity. Finally, our capital efficient path to expand network capability improve the quality of our products in a manner that's more capital efficient than our competitors gives us a structural advantage to compete over the long term. Ultimately, our strategy is founded on the principle of providing superior services at highly competitive prices. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Yeah. And Craig, with regard to CBRS and offload, we have our first infrastructure project that we're building that will use CBRS that won't be active until early next year. And I don't anticipate any meaningful national offload until beginning in '23. But that said, we - it is a long-term opportunity, and we're a nascent player in the mobile space and just beginning our acceleration. And we're incented to move significant amounts of traffic onto our own network, and we already do through our Wi-Fi network, which we can also optimize for traffic flow going forward. And we can do the same with CBRS and potentially other parties as well. So we have a opportunity to continuously lower our cost going forward and to - even if we were not using CBRS, we have an opportunity just through our volume of activity to continuously move down the price curve. So we're optimistic about our ability to grow our mobile business and at the same time, take costs out of our mobile business as it grows. And there are a variety of tools, including CBRS, that allow us to do that. But I would say that, without giving you an exact number, it would be material. The only thing I would add is the one thing it does, it gives you the ability to sell symmetrical data speeds at over a gig. And you can do that without really spending out much incremental capital. And at the moment, we really don't need that from a market facing perspective or from - I mean there's a perception issue in the market, but in terms of product use, there's none. And so we don't need it yet from a marketing perspective. And it's not the only tool in our toolbox. We have other technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0 and Full-Duplex, which we can use selectively and efficiently wherever augmentation or product definitions require. But I think the main thing to keep in mind is that, pathway we have to continuously upgrade our network capabilities is very efficient from a capital perspective and flexible. Michael, you might be on mute. There you go. Michael, I think the broadband market continues to expand, both through housing growth, population growth and adoption. The big issue in general adoption is more of a digital literacy issue than it is a cost issue. And it's continuing to improve in terms of market adoption because of the way people can use the tools on the Internet today, at any level and at any age. And so I think you have a continuous march of a broadband adoption right up to occupied housing over the next 5 years. And so you have that and then you have our ability to have a superior service with a capitally efficient ability to continuously upgrade that service. And we think we can - with a full range of products, including mobile and video, and we think we can continue to take share as a result of our ability to have high quality, low cost products available to consumers across the marketplace. With regard to video, why do we - why our number is relatively better? We're selling more packages that allow us to tailor video to customer needs. It's a difficult business because in general, video is very expensive. Our cost for video to provide it to customers are very high and continuously going up. And so there's people being priced out of the market. We put lower-priced packages into the market. The new products that have been developed direct-to-consumer products are churning at higher levels. And so our products also are in that re-adoption process of - that occurs as a result of churn. So to some extent, we think our video business is stabilizing, but at the other - on the other hand, the fundamental trends haven't stopped, which is that prices are being continuously passed through to consumers, and there's real pressure on the total cost of the bundle. The reason we're relatively better as we have, we've been moderate with our pricing, and we've been moderate, and we've created new packages that cost less. Yeah. Doug, we haven't fully deployed all of our channels. We have a store strategy that's multi-year, and that's still rolling out. And we expect to complete it by the end of this year, but a substantial portion of our stores are not done. And so even the channels that we wanted to deploy are not fully rolled out. But we have a variety of tools to grow our market share. And we have - and I would not preclude any of them that anybody else has ever used in history. But fundamentally, we haven't changed our pricing since we launched the product. And we have that ability to be - to move the needle in terms of the amount of mobile customers that we create as part of our broadband strategy. So I would say that we set up a strategy that was based on activity levels. Those activity levels are lower than we thought because churn is lower than we thought. But there's - there are more ways to get into the market than we are using. Well, I was just going to say that in terms of churn, fundamentally, recovery is slower than we thought it would be in terms of activity levels. And while we're performing well in all of that, it's not what we thought. So we're a little surprised at how slow move activity has rebounded. And so I'm - it is rebounded. Everything is moving and increasing and returning to normal. But it is not there, and it's still an unusual marketplace. That's not the way we think about it. John, with regard to Viacom, I would say this, it was a modern agreement, a new agreement and recognized that the video business is changing, and it addressed our legacy relationship and addressed our new direct-to-consumer relationship with Viacom. And they were, I think, happy with the discussion, and we were obviously since we agreed to it. And the - it's different than prior agreements because they have direct-to-consumer products, and those were integral to the discussion. And consistent with our view that we'd like to be part of the marketplace and to enhance our video and customer relationship with customers through managing transactions for them. So it did that. Jessica, with regard to our IP box solution, we've got a bunch of techniques and market facing IT strategies. One is that we have an app-based user interface, and a lot of our customers bring their own hardware and use our apps and get their MVPD service in that way from us. We also have the existing world box that we've deployed to our customer base. And in that world box is an IP platform. And we have - we are beginning to put apps, Netflix, YouTube and other apps on to our existing set-top box. And we continue to engage with Comcast on a discussion about their flex technology and what it might be are capable of doing for us. At higher CPMs. Well, I think your last question on competition, we continue to see a similar marketplace that we've seen for a number of years now in terms of competitive overbuilds. We're continuing to do well everywhere we operate, and we are the share leader everywhere we operate competitively speaking. The - with regard to programmers, yes, there's an opportunity depending on the model, either for an advertising sale in the app and at multiple levels and the transaction opportunity as well in creating new subscriptions. So I guess the short answer is yes. Yes, I do. I think there's an opportunity to have a better advertising business than we've had historically. That works better for advertisers. It's more direct. It's got attribution. And we have a large skilled sales force on the streets, in the cities that we operate. So yes, I think it's an opportunity to create increased revenue. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter's first quarter 2021 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the first quarter even in an environment with lower consumer move activity. We added over 300,000 customer relationships during the quarter with growth of 5.8% year-over-year. We also added 355,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 2 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We added 300,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% and our free cash flow by nearly $500 million or 35%. COVID has continued to have an impact on our operations, but the economy \u2013 as the economy reopens and normal activities resume, we expect more sales opportunities to develop during the second half of the year. And we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers' EBITDA and free cash flow at healthy rates given the investments we've made in our network, which enable us to offer superior products and services. While the last year has focused on our successful operations and execution through the pandemic, May 18 will mark the 5 anniversary of the closing of our transaction to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Since then, we've added more than 7 million Internet customers, and our annual EBITDA has expanded from $13.6 billion to over $19 billion, and our enterprise value has increased by $100 billion. Since the start of 2016, we've invested over $40 billion in infrastructure and technology. And over the last 5 years, we've extended serviceability to approximately 5 million homes and businesses. We've also committed to extending our network to reach more rural areas. Over the next 6 years, we expect to spend at least $5 billion, offset by $1.2 billion in RDOF subsidies to reach over 1 million unserved consumer locations to gigabit Internet speeds. And we're actively exploring additional opportunities to further expand our rural build potential. Since our transactions closed, we've also enhanced the quality and efficiency of our operations. We've hired thousands of new employees into good jobs by bringing all of our work back to the U.S., and we committed to a minimum wage of $20 per hour to provide the best service possible, which fuels our growth. Since close, we prepared the launch of mobile broadband products at scale, and our customers now have the fastest and least expensive mobile and wireline broadband products available in the market. Importantly, we continue to improve our connectivity products as demand for data in the home continues to grow at a very rapid pace. During the first quarter, we continued to see significant growth in data usage per Internet customer. On average, non-video customers used about 700 gigabytes per month in the first part of the quarter. And for the full quarter, average usage by non-video customers was up nearly 20% year-over-year. Close to 20% of our non-traditional video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth in IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the growing number of IP devices connected to our network, which now totals nearly 450 million devices, and new and emerging products and services that are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning for telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats, for example. We're continuously increasing the capacity in our core and hubs and augmenting our network to improve speed and performance at a pace dictated by customers in the marketplace. We have a cost-effective approach to using DOCSIS 3.1, which we've already deployed, to expand our network capacity 1.2 gigahertz, which gives us the ability to offer multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and at least 1 gigabit per second in the upstream. In additional \u2013 in addition, we have DOCSIS 4.0 and other emerging technologies to cost efficiently offer multi-gigabit speeds in both the downstream and in the upstream, serving heavy data usage needs of our customers with quality connectivity services. While we have a great network asset, which is fully deployed and has a capitally efficient path to deliver even higher capabilities, our strategy is founded on saving customers' money while providing state-of-the-art products. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package, which has delivered over a combination of mobile and fixed networks. Our share of household connectivity spend including mobile and fixed broadband, is low. And we remain very much underpenetrated relative to our long-term opportunity. An average household served by the big three mobile broadband competitors, with two-plus lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband, spends approximately $200 a month on its telecom services. Today, Charter only generates $33 a passing and $65 a customer of that $200 of combined monthly spend on mobile and wireline broadband service. By choosing Charter as their full-service connectivity provider, customers can save hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. And so our goal is to do the same with mobile in our service area as we did with wireline voice, where we made charter the predominant wireline phone carrier by reducing consumer telephone bills by over 70%. Meaning Charter can grow for a long time because we remain underpenetrated and our growth will reduce customer costs. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom. Before getting into the details of the quarter, a few comments regarding our outlook and reporting. On last quarter's conference call, I spent some time walking through the outlook for 2021, that commentary related to our customer and financial growth expectations given the difficult comparability to prior year results due to the effects of COVID in 2020. Those comments were intended to help investors update their models for 2021 and understand the backdrop for what should be a very good 2022. So while I won't repeat everything I said on the last earnings call, our outlook in general has not changed. 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021, where we expect Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. And we will continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year, and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation, to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. Secondly, bundle allocation rules as required by GAAP continue to have a significant impact on our residential Internet, video and voice product revenues. Because of the declining utility of individual product revenues to investors, it's likely that, at some point, will collapse all residential product revenues into one residential revenue line. Turning to our results on Slide 5. Customer activity levels in the marketplace, specifically move churn and non-pay churn, have still not returned to normal levels, which means, on the one hand, we benefit from the lower operating expense from reduced service transactions and significantly lower bad debt. But it also means there are fewer selling opportunities in the market generally. Those trends are on a slow path to normalization. Despite a lower sales environment, we continue to gain share across our footprint, and we remain the share leader in Internet in all of our markets regardless of competing infrastructure. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.7 million in the last 12 months and by 302,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 355,000 in the quarter and by 2 million or 7.3% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 138,000; wireline voice declined by 88,000; and we added 300,000 higher ARPU mobile lines. In residential Internet, we added a total of 334,000 customers in the quarter, lower than the 398,000 that we gained during a strong first quarter in 2019 for the reasons I mentioned. Our residential video customers declined by 156,000, consistent with the loss of 152,000 we saw in the first quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 102,000 residential customers in the quarter, also similar to the loss of 120,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to mobile. We added 300,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 million mobile lines with a good mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. We continue to be pleased with the results and trajectory of Spectrum Mobile, with less EBITDA loss per line as the business scales to expected stand-alone profitability. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.6 million or 5.8%. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.5% year-over-year, given the higher mix of non-video customers, higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base, lower pay-per-view and video-on-demand revenue and lower installation revenue given higher self-install rates. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.6%, a bit faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.5% year-over-year, also a bit better than last quarter and grew by 7.2%, excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 2.8% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue declined by 5.8% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Our non-political revenue grew by 5.3% year-over-year, primarily due to some COVID impacts late last March and our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue declined by 2% year-over-year, driven by lower late fees, partly offset by higher RSN revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $492 million with $228 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 6.7% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $235 million or 3.2% year-over-year. Programming increased 3.3% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the lower pay-per-view revenue I mentioned. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 8.9%, driven by more Laker games than normal this quarter, resulting from the delayed start to the NBA season, combined with fewer games in the prior year period when sports leagues played fewer games due to COVID. Excluding those sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 2.1% year-over-year. Cost to service customers declined by 2.4% year-over-year compared to 5.8% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by $100 million in lower bad debt, which continues to benefit from record payment trends similar to 2020, though our expectation remains that bad debt trends should normalize over the course of this year. On the other direction, we saw pressure from outsized hourly wage increases that we put through in March of last year and again in March of this year, which we've discussed previously and relate to our commitment to reach a $20 minimum starting wage in 2022. Excluding bad debt, cost of service customers grew by 3.2% year-over-year, including the minimum starting wage increase and reflecting the 5.8% relationship growth. Marketing and sales expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $572 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. In other expenses declined by 5.5%, primarily driven by a non-recurring adjustment to bonuses related to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.5% in the quarter. Excluding mobile and bad debt in both years, our EBITDA growth rate would have been 3.6 percentage points lower. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $807 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $396 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $360 million year-over-year, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage, with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. We also spent more on line extensions due to continued network expansion, including to rural areas. This does not include any yard-off spend, which we will incur and start to disclose later this year. The cost of build-outs tends to be front-loaded with design, make-ready construction before passings are activated. So it will take well into next year before our construction cadence lets any cost per passing metric to be meaningful. We spent $112 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding any RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $84.3 billion in debt principal, and our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in April is $4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares \u2013 Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $627 per share. In September of 2016, we've repurchased $43 billion or 34% of Charter's equity at an average price of $408 per share. Turning to taxes on Slide 13. We don't anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash tax payer until 2022, and we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of this year. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 to 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA, less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense, multiplied by 23% to 25% with a tax rate in 2022 to be a bit lower than that range given some carryover tax attributes. That estimate includes partnership tax distributions to advance Newhouse, which are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile. Our operating model of growing by saving customers' money. Our network capabilities now and in the future and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. And we expect our results to reflect a growing infrastructure asset with a lot of ancillary products to use for until on top of our core connectivity services with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax-advantaged levered equity returns. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Go ahead please. Your line is open. \nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. Good morning. One for Tom. One for Chris. Tom, I feel like you threw down the gauntlet a bit on fixed wireless convergence \u2013 fixed wireline convergence. I think the \u2013 including the entire mobile market in your target market of $200 a home of telecom spending. Does your commentary suggest a more aggressive posture regarding wireless marketing? You already have a pretty healthy growth pace of lines already. And when you look out 5 or 10 years, if that's where the market is headed, I know you've been asked and answered in the past, but wouldn't that suggest at some point need owner's economics on the wireless side to match up with what you have on the wireline side. And then, Chris, can you talk about the returns investors should expect on the $5 billion of build-out CapEx or the $3.8 billion net CapEx spend over the next 5 years? Thank you both. \nTom Rutledge: Sure. So Doug, yes, I think that our opportunity over a multiyear period is significant. And I think that we have an opportunity to \u2013 when you look at the penetration of those mobile products, we have an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. And so we are moving to make sure that happens in terms of the way we position and sell our products and in terms of their \u2013 both product attributes and the price that we charge. My \u2013 the purpose of that exposition on how much telecom spin there is, is just to show that there's lots of runway in front of us and a significant market opportunity there for us to create value for Charter while, at the same time, creating value for consumers. In terms of convergence, we already are moving toward convergence in many ways. And we have owners' economics in many ways. And we also have a good relationship as an MVNO. The owners' economics we get are in the CBRS spectrum that we purchased and its deployment in the Wi-Fi network that we've deployed and the traffic that we carry over it. And there's continued opportunities to take advantage of that in the near-term and the long-term to create additional value for our customers and for the company's cost structure.\nChris Winfrey: On the RDOF spend, Doug, the way we think about that $5 billion just in Phase 1 of RDOF, we think there may be more opportunities over time either through federal programs or through what we call white space areas that might be a product of the additional rural investing that we make that open up new opportunities. But when you think about this in terms of project financing, these construction projects have a much higher cost per passing than what we've typically built, and they have a longer payback. But as a result of them being as expensive as they are, we have a real high confidence in our ability to penetrate these markets with a broadband service that's needed and desired. And so what that means is, together with low-risk assumptions on ARPU, you can have pretty high confidence in terms of what the financial model is going to look like both from a cost and revenue perspective over time. So I think I've mentioned in the past that we'd expect the payback \u2013 the cash-from-cash payback for these type of projects to be double digits in terms of years, so over 10 years. But the IRR can be mid-teens. And so we think those attractive investment with a low risk in terms of our ability to achieve those types of returns. What we haven't factored into any of that is what does that open for additional building opportunities on the edge of those networks as well as some of these rural communities by having broadband can actually have more fill in or become more suburban like, which could open up opportunities, which aren't built into our model. We think it's consistent to build this way as part of our strategy, and we think it's the right thing to do for the extended communities that we serve. And we think it's attractive for shareholders as a way to continue to grow our broadband footprint over time. So another alternative way to think about it is when you think about those type of economics, it's actually not that different from cable M&A at a point in time where there just hasn't been unfortunately as much cable M&A that we would have liked to have done.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you. \nStefan Anninger: James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Tom, I was wondering if we could get your perspective. This came up on yesterday's Comcast call on sort of the consumer demand and opportunity for Charter to offer symmetric products and sort of the need for the network to offer symmetric service and kind of how you get there. You touched on 3.1 and 4.0 in your prepared remarks. But if you could give us a little sense of the past and time line in your mind and I guess the cost, whether it would move capital intensity around enough that we would notice And then I was just wondering, Chris, this sort of subdued activity level we're seeing, which is helping bad debt hurting gross adds, I know it's impossible to know, but could this end up sort of lasting through the year? I mean it seems like even though we're seeing vaccinations ramp back up, the consumer \u2013 we're seeing this across a lot of companies. This churn is at like record lows, so like unusually low levels. I'm just wondering if you \u2013 if you're seeing any signs that things are normalizing? Or if that's just an expectation you have? Thank you guys.\nTom Rutledge: So Ben, the issue of capacity and where it's needed and how it's used is a complicated discussion. But basically, our view is that if you think about the way networks are used, and I said people are using 700 gigs a month in the presentation today and a lot of our customers are using over a terabyte per month, most of that is television being delivered through IP to households. And the actual upstream usage is quite sufficient for all the current uses that we have. So we don't have an immediate need to expand the capacity of the plant. And the plant is actually used in a very asymmetric way by the products that are currently on it. And we don't see that changing in the near-term. But we do have the capability from a technical perspective to upgrade our network based on changing market dynamics, however they may develop in terms of how products develop. We don't see an immediate need to do that, but we do think our network from a competitive point of view is well positioned from a capital intensity perspective to make those upgrade costs at much lower cost than alternative means. And so we think that we're positioned to grow in the marketplace in a very efficient way and serve products that we need to serve up based on the way the market develops. But today, we should continue to operate our network with more capacity downstream than upstream.\nBen Swinburne: Great.\nChris Winfrey: Ben, on the lower level of activity, it's true. It's normalizing slightly slower than what we would have expected or hoped for. Like I said in the prepared remarks, the benefit is that we have really significant EBITDA growth as a result of last year's subscriber growth and this year \u2013 this quarter's subscriber growth, compounded by the lower level of activity in the marketplace, which is driving down transaction costs and churn and bad debt, which produces an outsized temporary financial result. Our preference would be to put a little bit of pressure on those financial results by increasing our sales and marketing through commissions and through normalizing the market through a higher level of move activity, which opens up additional selling opportunities for us as a share taker. It's a share-taker year. We'd like to be on the offensive and to acquire customers and save some money. And that opportunity is what contributes to net adds and what contributes to short-term financial pressure to have a higher long-term EBITDA and free cash flow. We have seen the market slowly coming back. And so it is moving in the right direction. It's just not moving as fast as some of us would like. That includes from move churn slight \u2013 not as much on non-pay because of all this subsidy that\u2019s out there today, which is a different topic. I think it's going to start getting back to normal here pretty quick. A lot of us who have been in the office every day through the pandemic that we're just noting this morning that the pickup in traffic even in the New York and Connecticut area, it's pretty symbolic in terms. It's going to normalize, and we think that will start to \u2013 it will continue to take place across the rest of the country. And so we're optimistic about our ability to sell and net add through the rest of the year.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please. Your line is open. \nBrett Feldman: Thanks. I'm going to kind of stick with a similar theme. I appreciate that moves creates a lot of jump balls for the company, but you only serve half the households in your footprint. The vast majority of those you don't serve, I think, are poorly served, and that's probably becoming increasingly apparent to them. Does the math on marketing dollars become more favorable, meaning looking to potentially force the issue a bit as opposed to just waiting for a natural shift in volumes in the market? And then also, I'm curious how significant is an assumption that, bad debt sort of reverts to normalized levels in terms of thinking about the margin profile of the company this year? And the reason I ask is it would seem like all the things going on in the background are favorable to bad debt, whether it's an expectation that the economy is going to continue to recover and also just the government continuing to show a prioritization and making sure that people not only have access to good broadband but are able to sustain that access, including through additional subsidy programs. It all just seems to be moving in your favor from a bad debt standpoint. Thanks. \nChris Winfrey: So, two separate topics. One and I am not sure if Tom would differ. But we feel we are pretty aggressive on the sales and marketing side. And to the extent that we could be more aggressive, and we thought that it would have the ability to add more subscribers, and we would do it. And so we are always looking for that, and we are not afraid to spend if we think we can drive customer acquisition, some of the difficulties that you are digging out customers and they are inert. And so you have to keep coming back and back and back. And as attractive as our products are and as much as we can save customers\u2019 money, it takes a while to prime loose, and it\u2019s disruptive to swap out one, if not all, of your services in the household. And despite the economics that we can provide and the better quality speeds and service, it just takes a little bit of time. But we are always looking for ways to be more aggressive. And as Tom mentioned, I think mobile, because of the additional outsized amount of dollars that we can save customers, is a really interesting tool, together with the combined benefits of products that we can provide that most cannot.\nTom Rutledge: I agree with that.\nChris Winfrey: Okay. Good for me. And bad debt. And look, there is a bull case that the market could start to move and our selling opportunities could increase, which would drive higher commissions and transaction costs to acquire and provision and install these customers. And the bull case would be at the same time, we have that because the level of subsidy that is out in the marketplace and might continue that our bad debt could remain low, and it could actually open up. Those subsidies could open up portions of the market from an affordability standpoint that could drive more sales. And so could end up with the best of the both worlds, maybe, but that\u2019s not something that we are betting on. It\u2019s an environment we have never really seen before. And that\u2019s not factored into any of the kind of outlook or forward-looking statements that were provided. I don\u2019t think we want to depend on third parties to drive our growth. And it may be the case that, that\u2019s how it turns out. But right now, we are focused on just selling more cable and minimizing the churn to the extent that we can things that are in our control.\nTom Rutledge: What I would say is that we are in an unusual climate, and it\u2019s still unusual. And when it normalizes, which I expect it to normalize, our cost structure will revert to what it was historically, and that includes a bad debt. And as a result of that, growth could accelerate, but growth also can create cost as \u2013 well, when you are comparing it to someone who isn\u2019t growing. And so that has an impact on margins. But the overall trajectory of our business, notwithstanding the current circumstances, which are really unprecedented. The fundamental cost to serve our customers continues to come down because of our digitization of the sales and marketing and service infrastructure of the company and our ability to do self-service and self-installation. And the relative ease of delivery going forward creates long-term advantages and the cost of CPE continues to come down on a relative basis. So, we have long run trends, which are favorable to our cost structure. We have short-term trends which are favorable to our cost structure which I expect to go away.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Two questions, if I could. Chris, I want to push you to just return to what you were just talking about of stimulus. And just given the size of the stimulus with \u2013 about 4x as much stimulus in dollars, about $20 billion as the annual growth rate of the entire U.S. band market. How do we think about quantifying that? I know you said it\u2019s not in your numbers, but can you just talk about what you as a company have done to prepare in terms of applications and what have you for the EBPP and the E-Rate? And what impact do you think that might have on your business? And then a second somewhat unrelated question, just if you could talk about the Business Services segment perhaps, and that\u2019s still growing significantly more slowly than residential. Are you more or less through the re-pricing of the TWC customers now, so that we can expect that to return to being a growth driver rather than, just mathematically today, being a growth drag?\nTom Rutledge: So Craig, on the stimulus, a lot of that money is undifferentiated in the States and has broadband in front of it in the nomenclature, but it\u2019s \u2013 it can go anywhere. And so yes, we are out, through our business sales services groups, trying to orient that money both to line extension and to products for schools and municipalities. And we have a full suite of products to sell. But how that money gets allocated and how it gets spent in the States is difficult to say. And I think it will vary by location. So it\u2019s a huge opportunity, as you pointed out, and it\u2019s massive. And our sense is that the States are \u2013 don\u2019t know how to spend it all. And so they are \u2013 we will see what happens, but there is an opportunity there.\nChris Winfrey: And as it relates to business services growth, there are really 2 separate categories here. One is SMB and enterprise. The re-pricing of the TWC base is essentially through for SMB. We have had some pressure recently through seasonality programs that we have offered to SMB customers through COVID that is winding down as well as the re-pricing being through. If you take a look at the unit growth on SMB, I think you can pretty quickly see a path for us to kind of get revenue growth than SMB more closely aligned to the unit growth rate or the customer relationship growth rate. So, I think the outlook on SMB from a revenue standpoint is positive. The same applies for enterprise. Enterprise is a slightly different set of circumstances. The retail revenue growth rate, like SMB, has been accelerating. And it\u2019s up sequentially, the same as SMB. It\u2019s now at 7.2% for the retail portion of revenue for enterprise. And it\u2019s being held back slightly by wholesale, particularly cell tower backhaul, where that\u2019s becoming a lesser and lesser portion of the overall revenue mix in enterprise. And the more strategic piece for us is retail in any event. The enterprise business is selling more, is doing extremely well, both certainly compared to last year, but also compared to 2019. And that\u2019s despite the fact that these are complex fiber products where today, less than 25% of the time, we are meeting our customers\u2019 CIOs in the office. So, that\u2019s a difficult sell to make when you are not in person to have a complex fiber cell, whether it\u2019s for fiber Internet access, Ethernet, unified communications, SD-WAN, and yet our sales are increasing and accelerating despite the fact that we can\u2019t be on location to make those cells. So, I am optimistic about the enterprise retail side and what that\u2019s going to do for the overall revenue growth rate, not only for enterprise, but when you look at commercial combined together with SMB, which is also improving.\nCraig Moffett: Thanks Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Craig. James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Supino with Bernstein. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPeter Supino: Hi. I wanted to ask about the mobile business. Do you expect to use device subsidies any more aggressively in the future? I know your unit economics have historically made that challenging and also have the sense that they are getting better. So, any thoughts on that strategy for the long run would be great? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: We \u2013 so far, we haven\u2019t done that much of that, and we like the way we are marketing it currently.\nChris Winfrey: It\u2019s not a great business. Yes, in of itself.\nTom Rutledge: We will create customers if we can retain those customers and whatever works, but we are doing well without it.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Peter. James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. A couple of sort of follow-ups. On broadband, Chris, can you talk about the drivers of seasonality in customer growth in a typical second quarter? And any differences we might see this year because of the pandemic? And do you think that could be offset somewhat by increasing win opportunities in ABB? And then second, on CapEx, higher or at least stable, not stable to lower in the core cable business. What\u2019s changing there? Do you see more opportunities? Is that a function of mobile? What\u2019s happening? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: On broadband, I don\u2019t see the broader seasonality differences that have always existed in Q2 with disconnects in Q3 with reconnects. A lot of that\u2019s college and back-to-school driven as well as the mood season of people repositioning it if anything. On one end I think it will be normal, on the other hand you could argue that things really do get back to fully normalized level to maybe a pent up demand for that type of activity. So, I don\u2019t know. The two factors you mentioned which could around the edges have an impact slightly, although I don\u2019t think it changes the overall curve, would be to the extent that subsidies and stimulus continued to drive down non-pay. And at the same time, we had an acceleration of move churn, which is a lot more selling opportunities, maybe that could have a positive impact. And the other one that you pointed out was the EBPP program, which could have similar type of benefits both on the non-pay as well as on the activation side. But I don\u2019t think that fundamentally, the overall trend of Q2 compared to Q1 or Q3 or Q4 is going to be that much different. On CapEx, we slightly tweaked what we said from an outlook perspective. And it ties back to what I talked about with Ben in terms of the market is normalizing, but just at a slightly slower pace. But as that market has been \u2013 remains slow to normalize, data usage remains high. And so that has an impact on the amount of headroom we planned for in terms of capacity and network augmentation. Now it\u2019s very much possible our core cable capital intensity declines this year. But given the uncertainty, we updated the outlook slightly to say relatively \u201cconsistent\u201d with last year. But I want to be clear, there is no change to our long-term outlook for core cable capital intensity to decline.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks. Chris, do you think that with mobile wireless broadband coming on, does that give you any pause on your assumption for a strong second half or is that sort of built in already?\nChris Winfrey: Mobile wireless broadband, you mean our home mobile wireless broadband.\nPhil Cusick: Wireless \u2013 sorry, no, competitive wireless broadband coming to the markets?\nChris Winfrey: We are not a wireless broadband, but \u2013 are you talking about somebody else\u2019s?\nPhil Cusick: Sorry. I mean T-Mobile and Verizon, T-Mobile and Verizon mid-band wireless offerings?\nChris Winfrey: Look, we are always concerned about competition, and we are watching for it. On the increment, and I think there will be added pressure. We think it\u2019s a real product for certain areas of a customer base. And so it\u2019s something we are keeping an eye on. And we have our own mobile broadband wireless together with our fixed line broadband converged we think competes well, and it requires us to continue to invest in that space.\nTom Rutledge: And we will be on that spectrum as well.\nChris Winfrey: Correct. From a C-band perspective, that will be something we participate through the MVNO and then we have our own CBRS, which you are aware of as well.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Phil. James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. First, can you share your mix of broadband customers between entry level versus higher level tiers? And how you are looking at the ARPU opportunities and take to migrate customers to higher performance levels? And then secondly, just from your comments earlier, can you share what the fair average rate of estimated pass-through growth can be for Charter if you think about it on a 3-year to 5-year horizon, and you could share that with or without RDOF? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: In terms of the broadband customer base, most of our customer base is on entry level package, meaning 200 megabits. So, our basic strategy has been to have a very rich broadband product as our base product. And we have continuously taken that up. And so in terms of opportunities to sell up, we have a lot of it. We haven\u2019t done much of that really. We do it. And obviously, we satisfy the market, but the bulk of our customer base is at the entry-level speed, which is quite high. Our \u2013 I am not sure I fully understood what you were going at with the passings growth. But it\u2019s really about housing starts and versus if you take out the RDOF out of it and what\u2019s that going to look like. And yes, we \u2013 our footprint pretty much looks like the United States from a statistical perspective. And so if you look at housing starts and you have an opinion on that, that will probably mirror our passings growth.\nChris Winfrey: I agree. That will be the variability driver. Just to put in context of what\u2019s going on today, we are building about \u2013 we are constructing about 600,000 a year, much of which is rural extensions proactive on our part already before RDOF. The remainder of what you see of our passings growth is fill-in and other type of what we call brownfield opportunities.\nTom Rutledge: Well, new developments.\nChris Winfrey: New developments.\nTom Rutledge: So that\u2019s in Florida.\nChris Winfrey: Yes, certainly. That will all depend on the overall housing starts growth. And then during the period of RDOF, there is an additional over 1 million homes that we will construct in these rural areas to address RDOF on top of whatever the organic growth rate is, which a big driver is the housing starts, as Tom mentioned.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Mike. Operator, we will take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I have a question with, I guess, a two-parter on video, which hasn\u2019t come up at all. Are there any plans to offer a product similar to Comcast\u2019 Flex? Can you \u2013 maybe you could talk about the pros and cons from a Charter perspective? And then is there any difference in how you are approaching programmers that are now offering direct-to-consumer services that mirror or encompass a lot of the content they have on their pay TV channels?\nTom Rutledge: Jessica, the video business is under a lot of challenge, and it\u2019s going through a transformation. And we are \u2013 we have over 10 million customers now who receive our service through an application as opposed to a set-top box. And we have direct-to-consumer relationships, and we have new relationships with programmers developing that allow us to sell traditional content and bundles. We have different kinds of bundles, some are traditional cable TV packages, some are over-the-top packages and some are direct to consumers, where we are representing direct-to-consumer relationship and really essentially acting in a consignment kind of mode. So, we have every business model you can imagine going on simultaneously, which I think over the long-term creates opportunity for us. Right now, it\u2019s quite disruptive.\nChris Winfrey: And on approach to programmers.\nTom Rutledge: Well, you mean how we deal with programmers from a content perspective, you mean\u2026\nChris Winfrey: Yes. It hasn\u2019t changed because of the way that they are selling content into the...\nTom Rutledge: Well, it\u2019s going to affect the value of content. And obviously, if content comes out of bundled packages and goes direct-to-consumer, its value in the bundle goes down.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Jessica. James, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks guys. Two unrelated questions. First, Tom, I thought the message on the magnitude of investment you have put into building a future proof network at the beginning of the call is pretty powerful, both in terms of what you have invested over the course of the last 5 years and what you will invest over the course of next 5 years. I am wondering what you would be able to share from the conversations you have been having with the administration around their ambitions for $100 billion in infrastructure investment in broadband. Wondering how \u2013 specifically how you guys see the opportunity to benefit from that if it were to come to pass? And where you see potential threats? And then separately, I just looked back at where voice penetration of broadband customers peaked, and it peaked at 50%. And that probably understates your market share because it peaked at the end of \u201815 when the market was already declining. I am wondering if you can remind us where market share of wired voice peaked for you guys. And is that basically where you are setting your expectation for mobile penetration to go over time?\nTom Rutledge: Well, my hope is to have all the share over time. And so we have significant ambition. It will take a long, long time to get that. But if you do \u2013 I don\u2019t have the wireline share off the top of my head, but it\u2019s significant.\nChris Winfrey: There were years and years and years where when we modeled and forecasted and realized what we were getting, it was always at 50% of broadband to your point. And so until the wireline substitution with mobile really took place in a significant way, that was pretty reliable for a long time. So, I think that where really going gives you what you are looking for.\nJonathan Chaplin: If you look at how much of the wireline business we currently own...\nChris Winfrey: Yes.\nTom Rutledge: It\u2019s significant. And it\u2019s oddly, we got the right to be in to compete in the telephone business, and we are a telephone company now. And that\u2019s kind of strange when you think about it. In terms of how we are communicating with regard to broadband build-out and subsidy and infrastructure subsidies, our view is that the job one is to get the un-served areas of the country served and that subsidies should be directed to do that. And we are willing to help and invest and to make that happen. And that the private capital that\u2019s been deployed in the United States in the communications networks, the capital that just got spent on Spectrum by the wireless companies and us and Comcast and the CBRS auction and the capital that\u2019s going into \u2013 that has gone into and continues to go into the communications infrastructure in the country is good and held us in good stead in \u2013 through the pandemic when we were able to operate networks at high capacity instantaneously, unlike Western Europe and other places where communication services and entertainment services were actually down rest. So, we think there is a good model there and an opportunity to serve the un-served and would like to help and be part of it.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Jonathan. James\u2026\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I am going to go off the beat and pass a little bit here. Can you talk about how you are thinking about the future of your Los Angeles RSNs, given the pressures on pay TV bundle volumes that you just talked about against your fixed rates and production costs? What\u2019s the right long-term model for the business? And also under your rights agreements, could you actually bundle it as an app with broadband outside of a bundled service? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Well, luckily, it\u2019s not a material part of our business. It\u2019s difficult, and it\u2019s expensive and the prices continue to go up. It\u2019s hard to say how we could monetize it effectively over the long run.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Bryan. Operator, we will take our last question please.\nOperator: And our last question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Go ahead please. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. I have got two. Chris, given where you are on your wireless subscriber growth, I think you are sort of like 10% behind Comcast, and they are sort of broken even from a profitability standpoint. Is that something we can extrapolate looking out quarter 2 away that it\u2019s no longer \u2013 wireless is no longer going to be sort of a headwind on EBITDA growth? It\u2019s not \u2013 is there any reason in economics that changes that? And for Tom, your comments, even last quarter and this quarter, talked about obviously healthy broadband growth this year. But interestingly, you talked about acceleration in 2022. Can you sort of talk about what gives you the confidence on that? Is that RDOF contributions or just sort of natural on the core base? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So on the wireless EBITDA, and our goal is \u2013 it\u2019s going to sound bad, but our goal isn\u2019t to drive short-term EBITDA profitability. Our goal is to drive as much growth as we can because we know what the underlying profitability is and what it does for the overall business. So, I don\u2019t think we are going to be forecasting EBITDA breakeven on a consolidated wireless business basis, which isn\u2019t even how we look at the business because we think about it combined. And that being said, we have essentially the same economics as Comcast, and so the model is very similar. And \u2013 but we are focused on really driving as much subscriber acquisition as we can. The business itself, absent any subscriber acquisition costs, so absent any marketing and sales, already cleared profitability absent growth cost at the 2 million lines mark. So, we are well into that territory. So really, what you are looking at in terms of an EBITDA drag right now is really about new subscriber acquisition. And that\u2019s something, if we have the opportunity to push through, we are going to go do that. And so I don\u2019t want to give necessarily a guidance or an outlook on that. But the trend continues to improve despite the fact that we have a very strong net addition rate on wireless lines.\nTom Rutledge: And if I understand your question, it was why do we have confidence that broadband growth will accelerate? And why \u201822 will be better than \u201821? I think that our basic view is that if you go back over the last few years that we have been on a growth track, and that growth track has been accelerating, and we had a very anomalous situation in 2020 that carries into \u201821. And that if you just sort of trend out that long-term line, it gets back on that line in \u201822. And that\u2019s really what we are saying. It\u2019s that simple.\nChris Winfrey: I don\u2019t think RDOF is going to be a significant contributor in 2022, just given the limited number of activated passings that will be there. So, I don\u2019t think about that as a material driver. I think about just the momentum and the ability to use mobile, which we have treated as an attribute to the broadband product as a way to continue to drive growth and to continue to improve retention on the broadband side.\nVijay Jayant: Okay. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Vijay and thanks to everyone for listening. James, I will pass it back to you.\nOperator: This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Before getting into the details of the quarter, a few comments regarding our outlook and reporting. On last quarter's conference call, I spent some time walking through the outlook for 2021, that commentary related to our customer and financial growth expectations given the difficult comparability to prior year results due to the effects of COVID in 2020. Those comments were intended to help investors update their models for 2021 and understand the backdrop for what should be a very good 2022. So while I won't repeat everything I said on the last earnings call, our outlook in general has not changed. 2019 remains the better customer growth comparison for 2021, where we expect Internet and customer relationships to be at or above 2019 net additions. And we will continue to reference the COVID schedules we've provided last year, and included again on Slide 17 and 18 of today's presentation, to help with the year-over-year financial comparisons. Secondly, bundle allocation rules as required by GAAP continue to have a significant impact on our residential Internet, video and voice product revenues. Because of the declining utility of individual product revenues to investors, it's likely that, at some point, will collapse all residential product revenues into one residential revenue line. Turning to our results on Slide 5. Customer activity levels in the marketplace, specifically move churn and non-pay churn, have still not returned to normal levels, which means, on the one hand, we benefit from the lower operating expense from reduced service transactions and significantly lower bad debt. But it also means there are fewer selling opportunities in the market generally. Those trends are on a slow path to normalization. Despite a lower sales environment, we continue to gain share across our footprint, and we remain the share leader in Internet in all of our markets regardless of competing infrastructure. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by over 1.7 million in the last 12 months and by 302,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customers by 355,000 in the quarter and by 2 million or 7.3% over the last 12 months. Video declined by 138,000; wireline voice declined by 88,000; and we added 300,000 higher ARPU mobile lines. In residential Internet, we added a total of 334,000 customers in the quarter, lower than the 398,000 that we gained during a strong first quarter in 2019 for the reasons I mentioned. Our residential video customers declined by 156,000, consistent with the loss of 152,000 we saw in the first quarter of 2019. In wireline voice, we lost 102,000 residential customers in the quarter, also similar to the loss of 120,000 in the first quarter of 2019. Turning to mobile. We added 300,000 mobile lines in the quarter. And as of the end of the quarter, we had 2.7 million mobile lines with a good mix of both Unlimited and By the Gig lines. We continue to be pleased with the results and trajectory of Spectrum Mobile, with less EBITDA loss per line as the business scales to expected stand-alone profitability. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by 1.6 million or 5.8%. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.5% year-over-year, given the higher mix of non-video customers, higher mix of choice, essentials and stream customers within our video base, lower pay-per-view and video-on-demand revenue and lower installation revenue given higher self-install rates. Keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 5.8% year-over-year, reflecting customer relationship growth. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.6%, a bit faster than last quarter's growth. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.5% year-over-year, also a bit better than last quarter and grew by 7.2%, excluding wholesale revenue. Enterprise PSUs grew by 2.8% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue declined by 5.8% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Our non-political revenue grew by 5.3% year-over-year, primarily due to some COVID impacts late last March and our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue declined by 2% year-over-year, driven by lower late fees, partly offset by higher RSN revenue. Mobile revenue totaled $492 million with $228 million of that revenue being device revenue. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 6.7% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $235 million or 3.2% year-over-year. Programming increased 3.3% year-over-year due to higher rates, offset by a higher mix of lighter video packages, such as Choice, Essentials and Stream, and lower pay-per-view expenses year-over-year tied to the lower pay-per-view revenue I mentioned. Regulatory connectivity and produced content grew by 8.9%, driven by more Laker games than normal this quarter, resulting from the delayed start to the NBA season, combined with fewer games in the prior year period when sports leagues played fewer games due to COVID. Excluding those sports rights costs related to our RSNs, this expense line item grew by 2.1% year-over-year. Cost to service customers declined by 2.4% year-over-year compared to 5.8% customer relationship growth. The decline was driven by $100 million in lower bad debt, which continues to benefit from record payment trends similar to 2020, though our expectation remains that bad debt trends should normalize over the course of this year. On the other direction, we saw pressure from outsized hourly wage increases that we put through in March of last year and again in March of this year, which we've discussed previously and relate to our commitment to reach a $20 minimum starting wage in 2022. Excluding bad debt, cost of service customers grew by 3.2% year-over-year, including the minimum starting wage increase and reflecting the 5.8% relationship growth. Marketing and sales expenses declined by 2% year-over-year. Mobile expenses totaled $572 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. In other expenses declined by 5.5%, primarily driven by a non-recurring adjustment to bonuses related to COVID. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 12.5% in the quarter. Excluding mobile and bad debt in both years, our EBITDA growth rate would have been 3.6 percentage points lower. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $807 million of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $396 million last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in the first quarter, an increase of $360 million year-over-year, driven by higher scalable infrastructure spend, primarily related to augmentation of our network capacity at our normal pace for customer growth and usage, with incremental spending to reclaim the network headroom we maintained prior to COVID. We also spent more on line extensions due to continued network expansion, including to rural areas. This does not include any yard-off spend, which we will incur and start to disclose later this year. The cost of build-outs tends to be front-loaded with design, make-ready construction before passings are activated. So it will take well into next year before our construction cadence lets any cost per passing metric to be meaningful. We spent $112 million on mobile-related CapEx this quarter, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems and mobile store build-outs. For the full year 2021, we expect cable capital expenditures, excluding any RDOF investments, to be relatively consistent as a percentage of cable revenue versus 2020. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.9 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, an increase of 35% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $84.3 billion in debt principal, and our current run rate annualized cash interest, pro forma for financing activity completed in April is $4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.38x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.3 million shares \u2013 Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $4 billion at an average price of $627 per share. In September of 2016, we've repurchased $43 billion or 34% of Charter's equity at an average price of $408 per share. Turning to taxes on Slide 13. We don't anticipate becoming a meaningful federal cash tax payer until 2022, and we expect the bulk of our existing NOL to be utilized by the end of this year. Subject to any corporate tax rate changes for the years 2022 to 2024, we expect our federal and state cash taxes to approximate our consolidated EBITDA, less our capital expenditures and less our cash interest expense, multiplied by 23% to 25% with a tax rate in 2022 to be a bit lower than that range given some carryover tax attributes. That estimate includes partnership tax distributions to advance Newhouse, which are captured separately in cash flows from financing in the financial statements. There are multiple factors that impact what I just described, and we're always looking for ways to improve our cash tax profile. Our operating model of growing by saving customers' money. Our network capabilities now and in the future and our balance sheet strategy all work together over long periods of time. And we expect our results to reflect a growing infrastructure asset with a lot of ancillary products to use for until on top of our core connectivity services with good value and service to our customers to grow cash flow with tax-advantaged levered equity returns. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. On the RDOF spend, Doug, the way we think about that $5 billion just in Phase 1 of RDOF, we think there may be more opportunities over time either through federal programs or through what we call white space areas that might be a product of the additional rural investing that we make that open up new opportunities. But when you think about this in terms of project financing, these construction projects have a much higher cost per passing than what we've typically built, and they have a longer payback. But as a result of them being as expensive as they are, we have a real high confidence in our ability to penetrate these markets with a broadband service that's needed and desired. And so what that means is, together with low-risk assumptions on ARPU, you can have pretty high confidence in terms of what the financial model is going to look like both from a cost and revenue perspective over time. So I think I've mentioned in the past that we'd expect the payback \u2013 the cash-from-cash payback for these type of projects to be double digits in terms of years, so over 10 years. But the IRR can be mid-teens. And so we think those attractive investment with a low risk in terms of our ability to achieve those types of returns. What we haven't factored into any of that is what does that open for additional building opportunities on the edge of those networks as well as some of these rural communities by having broadband can actually have more fill in or become more suburban like, which could open up opportunities, which aren't built into our model. We think it's consistent to build this way as part of our strategy, and we think it's the right thing to do for the extended communities that we serve. And we think it's attractive for shareholders as a way to continue to grow our broadband footprint over time. So another alternative way to think about it is when you think about those type of economics, it's actually not that different from cable M&A at a point in time where there just hasn't been unfortunately as much cable M&A that we would have liked to have done. Ben, on the lower level of activity, it's true. It's normalizing slightly slower than what we would have expected or hoped for. Like I said in the prepared remarks, the benefit is that we have really significant EBITDA growth as a result of last year's subscriber growth and this year \u2013 this quarter's subscriber growth, compounded by the lower level of activity in the marketplace, which is driving down transaction costs and churn and bad debt, which produces an outsized temporary financial result. Our preference would be to put a little bit of pressure on those financial results by increasing our sales and marketing through commissions and through normalizing the market through a higher level of move activity, which opens up additional selling opportunities for us as a share taker. It's a share-taker year. We'd like to be on the offensive and to acquire customers and save some money. And that opportunity is what contributes to net adds and what contributes to short-term financial pressure to have a higher long-term EBITDA and free cash flow. We have seen the market slowly coming back. And so it is moving in the right direction. It's just not moving as fast as some of us would like. That includes from move churn slight \u2013 not as much on non-pay because of all this subsidy that's out there today, which is a different topic. I think it's going to start getting back to normal here pretty quick. A lot of us who have been in the office every day through the pandemic that we're just noting this morning that the pickup in traffic even in the New York and Connecticut area, it's pretty symbolic in terms. It's going to normalize, and we think that will start to \u2013 it will continue to take place across the rest of the country. And so we're optimistic about our ability to sell and net add through the rest of the year. So, two separate topics. One and I am not sure if Tom would differ. But we feel we are pretty aggressive on the sales and marketing side. And to the extent that we could be more aggressive, and we thought that it would have the ability to add more subscribers, and we would do it. And so we are always looking for that, and we are not afraid to spend if we think we can drive customer acquisition, some of the difficulties that you are digging out customers and they are inert. And so you have to keep coming back and back and back. And as attractive as our products are and as much as we can save customers' money, it takes a while to prime loose, and it's disruptive to swap out one, if not all, of your services in the household. And despite the economics that we can provide and the better quality speeds and service, it just takes a little bit of time. But we are always looking for ways to be more aggressive. And as Tom mentioned, I think mobile, because of the additional outsized amount of dollars that we can save customers, is a really interesting tool, together with the combined benefits of products that we can provide that most cannot. Okay. Good for me. And bad debt. And look, there is a bull case that the market could start to move and our selling opportunities could increase, which would drive higher commissions and transaction costs to acquire and provision and install these customers. And the bull case would be at the same time, we have that because the level of subsidy that is out in the marketplace and might continue that our bad debt could remain low, and it could actually open up. Those subsidies could open up portions of the market from an affordability standpoint that could drive more sales. And so could end up with the best of the both worlds, maybe, but that's not something that we are betting on. It's an environment we have never really seen before. And that's not factored into any of the kind of outlook or forward-looking statements that were provided. I don't think we want to depend on third parties to drive our growth. And it may be the case that, that's how it turns out. But right now, we are focused on just selling more cable and minimizing the churn to the extent that we can things that are in our control. And as it relates to business services growth, there are really 2 separate categories here. One is SMB and enterprise. The re-pricing of the TWC base is essentially through for SMB. We have had some pressure recently through seasonality programs that we have offered to SMB customers through COVID that is winding down as well as the re-pricing being through. If you take a look at the unit growth on SMB, I think you can pretty quickly see a path for us to kind of get revenue growth than SMB more closely aligned to the unit growth rate or the customer relationship growth rate. So, I think the outlook on SMB from a revenue standpoint is positive. The same applies for enterprise. Enterprise is a slightly different set of circumstances. The retail revenue growth rate, like SMB, has been accelerating. And it's up sequentially, the same as SMB. It's now at 7.2% for the retail portion of revenue for enterprise. And it's being held back slightly by wholesale, particularly cell tower backhaul, where that's becoming a lesser and lesser portion of the overall revenue mix in enterprise. And the more strategic piece for us is retail in any event. The enterprise business is selling more, is doing extremely well, both certainly compared to last year, but also compared to 2019. And that's despite the fact that these are complex fiber products where today, less than 25% of the time, we are meeting our customers' CIOs in the office. So, that's a difficult sell to make when you are not in person to have a complex fiber cell, whether it's for fiber Internet access, Ethernet, unified communications, SD-WAN, and yet our sales are increasing and accelerating despite the fact that we can't be on location to make those cells. So, I am optimistic about the enterprise retail side and what that's going to do for the overall revenue growth rate, not only for enterprise, but when you look at commercial combined together with SMB, which is also improving. It's not a great business. Yes, in of itself. On broadband, I don't see the broader seasonality differences that have always existed in Q2 with disconnects in Q3 with reconnects. A lot of that's college and back-to-school driven as well as the mood season of people repositioning it if anything. On one end I think it will be normal, on the other hand you could argue that things really do get back to fully normalized level to maybe a pent up demand for that type of activity. So, I don't know. The two factors you mentioned which could around the edges have an impact slightly, although I don't think it changes the overall curve, would be to the extent that subsidies and stimulus continued to drive down non-pay. And at the same time, we had an acceleration of move churn, which is a lot more selling opportunities, maybe that could have a positive impact. And the other one that you pointed out was the EBPP program, which could have similar type of benefits both on the non-pay as well as on the activation side. But I don't think that fundamentally, the overall trend of Q2 compared to Q1 or Q3 or Q4 is going to be that much different. On CapEx, we slightly tweaked what we said from an outlook perspective. And it ties back to what I talked about with Ben in terms of the market is normalizing, but just at a slightly slower pace. But as that market has been \u2013 remains slow to normalize, data usage remains high. And so that has an impact on the amount of headroom we planned for in terms of capacity and network augmentation. Now it's very much possible our core cable capital intensity declines this year. But given the uncertainty, we updated the outlook slightly to say relatively \u201cconsistent\u201d with last year. But I want to be clear, there is no change to our long-term outlook for core cable capital intensity to decline. Mobile wireless broadband, you mean our home mobile wireless broadband. We are not a wireless broadband, but \u2013 are you talking about somebody else's? Look, we are always concerned about competition, and we are watching for it. On the increment, and I think there will be added pressure. We think it's a real product for certain areas of a customer base. And so it's something we are keeping an eye on. And we have our own mobile broadband wireless together with our fixed line broadband converged we think competes well, and it requires us to continue to invest in that space. Correct. From a C-band perspective, that will be something we participate through the MVNO and then we have our own CBRS, which you are aware of as well. I agree. That will be the variability driver. Just to put in context of what's going on today, we are building about \u2013 we are constructing about 600,000 a year, much of which is rural extensions proactive on our part already before RDOF. The remainder of what you see of our passings growth is fill-in and other type of what we call brownfield opportunities. New developments. Yes, certainly. That will all depend on the overall housing starts growth. And then during the period of RDOF, there is an additional over 1 million homes that we will construct in these rural areas to address RDOF on top of whatever the organic growth rate is, which a big driver is the housing starts, as Tom mentioned. And on approach to programmers. Yes. It hasn't changed because of the way that they are selling content into the... There were years and years and years where when we modeled and forecasted and realized what we were getting, it was always at 50% of broadband to your point. And so until the wireline substitution with mobile really took place in a significant way, that was pretty reliable for a long time. So, I think that where really going gives you what you are looking for. Yes. So on the wireless EBITDA, and our goal is \u2013 it's going to sound bad, but our goal isn't to drive short-term EBITDA profitability. Our goal is to drive as much growth as we can because we know what the underlying profitability is and what it does for the overall business. So, I don't think we are going to be forecasting EBITDA breakeven on a consolidated wireless business basis, which isn't even how we look at the business because we think about it combined. And that being said, we have essentially the same economics as Comcast, and so the model is very similar. And \u2013 but we are focused on really driving as much subscriber acquisition as we can. The business itself, absent any subscriber acquisition costs, so absent any marketing and sales, already cleared profitability absent growth cost at the 2 million lines mark. So, we are well into that territory. So really, what you are looking at in terms of an EBITDA drag right now is really about new subscriber acquisition. And that's something, if we have the opportunity to push through, we are going to go do that. And so I don't want to give necessarily a guidance or an outlook on that. But the trend continues to improve despite the fact that we have a very strong net addition rate on wireless lines. I don't think RDOF is going to be a significant contributor in 2022, just given the limited number of activated passings that will be there. So, I don't think about that as a material driver. I think about just the momentum and the ability to use mobile, which we have treated as an attribute to the broadband product as a way to continue to drive growth and to continue to improve retention on the broadband side."

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. We continue to execute well in the first quarter even in an environment with lower consumer move activity. We added over 300,000 customer relationships during the quarter with growth of 5.8% year-over-year. We also added 355,000 Internet customers in the quarter and 2 million over the last year for a year-over-year growth of 7.3%. We added 300,000 mobile lines, and we grew our adjusted EBITDA by 12.5% and our free cash flow by nearly $500 million or 35%. COVID has continued to have an impact on our operations, but the economy \u2013 as the economy reopens and normal activities resume, we expect more sales opportunities to develop during the second half of the year. And we remain confident in our ability to grow our customers' EBITDA and free cash flow at healthy rates given the investments we've made in our network, which enable us to offer superior products and services. While the last year has focused on our successful operations and execution through the pandemic, May 18 will mark the 5 anniversary of the closing of our transaction to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Since then, we've added more than 7 million Internet customers, and our annual EBITDA has expanded from $13.6 billion to over $19 billion, and our enterprise value has increased by $100 billion. Since the start of 2016, we've invested over $40 billion in infrastructure and technology. And over the last 5 years, we've extended serviceability to approximately 5 million homes and businesses. We've also committed to extending our network to reach more rural areas. Over the next 6 years, we expect to spend at least $5 billion, offset by $1.2 billion in RDOF subsidies to reach over 1 million unserved consumer locations to gigabit Internet speeds. And we're actively exploring additional opportunities to further expand our rural build potential. Since our transactions closed, we've also enhanced the quality and efficiency of our operations. We've hired thousands of new employees into good jobs by bringing all of our work back to the U.S., and we committed to a minimum wage of $20 per hour to provide the best service possible, which fuels our growth. Since close, we prepared the launch of mobile broadband products at scale, and our customers now have the fastest and least expensive mobile and wireline broadband products available in the market. Importantly, we continue to improve our connectivity products as demand for data in the home continues to grow at a very rapid pace. During the first quarter, we continued to see significant growth in data usage per Internet customer. On average, non-video customers used about 700 gigabytes per month in the first part of the quarter. And for the full quarter, average usage by non-video customers was up nearly 20% year-over-year. Close to 20% of our non-traditional video Internet customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. The growth in demand for data is and will be driven by a number of factors, including the growth in IP video services, including video conferencing and gaming, also the growing number of IP devices connected to our network, which now totals nearly 450 million devices, and new and emerging products and services that are being developed as we speak, such as e-learning for telemedicine and 4K, virtual reality or holographic formats, for example. We're continuously increasing the capacity in our core and hubs and augmenting our network to improve speed and performance at a pace dictated by customers in the marketplace. We have a cost-effective approach to using DOCSIS 3.1, which we've already deployed, to expand our network capacity 1.2 gigahertz, which gives us the ability to offer multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream and at least 1 gigabit per second in the upstream. In additional \u2013 in addition, we have DOCSIS 4.0 and other emerging technologies to cost efficiently offer multi-gigabit speeds in both the downstream and in the upstream, serving heavy data usage needs of our customers with quality connectivity services. While we have a great network asset, which is fully deployed and has a capitally efficient path to deliver even higher capabilities, our strategy is founded on saving customers' money while providing state-of-the-art products. Mobile and wireline broadband are converging into a single connectivity service package, which has delivered over a combination of mobile and fixed networks. Our share of household connectivity spend including mobile and fixed broadband, is low. And we remain very much underpenetrated relative to our long-term opportunity. An average household served by the big three mobile broadband competitors, with two-plus lines of mobile broadband and wireline broadband, spends approximately $200 a month on its telecom services. Today, Charter only generates $33 a passing and $65 a customer of that $200 of combined monthly spend on mobile and wireline broadband service. By choosing Charter as their full-service connectivity provider, customers can save hundreds, even thousands of dollars per year with better product capabilities and service. And so our goal is to do the same with mobile in our service area as we did with wireline voice, where we made charter the predominant wireline phone carrier by reducing consumer telephone bills by over 70%. Meaning Charter can grow for a long time because we remain underpenetrated and our growth will reduce customer costs. Now I'll turn the call over to Chris. Sure. So Doug, yes, I think that our opportunity over a multiyear period is significant. And I think that we have an opportunity to \u2013 when you look at the penetration of those mobile products, we have an opportunity to continue to grow rapidly. And so we are moving to make sure that happens in terms of the way we position and sell our products and in terms of their \u2013 both product attributes and the price that we charge. My \u2013 the purpose of that exposition on how much telecom spin there is, is just to show that there's lots of runway in front of us and a significant market opportunity there for us to create value for Charter while, at the same time, creating value for consumers. In terms of convergence, we already are moving toward convergence in many ways. And we have owners' economics in many ways. And we also have a good relationship as an MVNO. The owners' economics we get are in the CBRS spectrum that we purchased and its deployment in the Wi-Fi network that we've deployed and the traffic that we carry over it. And there's continued opportunities to take advantage of that in the near-term and the long-term to create additional value for our customers and for the company's cost structure. So Ben, the issue of capacity and where it's needed and how it's used is a complicated discussion. But basically, our view is that if you think about the way networks are used, and I said people are using 700 gigs a month in the presentation today and a lot of our customers are using over a terabyte per month, most of that is television being delivered through IP to households. And the actual upstream usage is quite sufficient for all the current uses that we have. So we don't have an immediate need to expand the capacity of the plant. And the plant is actually used in a very asymmetric way by the products that are currently on it. And we don't see that changing in the near-term. But we do have the capability from a technical perspective to upgrade our network based on changing market dynamics, however they may develop in terms of how products develop. We don't see an immediate need to do that, but we do think our network from a competitive point of view is well positioned from a capital intensity perspective to make those upgrade costs at much lower cost than alternative means. And so we think that we're positioned to grow in the marketplace in a very efficient way and serve products that we need to serve up based on the way the market develops. But today, we should continue to operate our network with more capacity downstream than upstream. I agree with that. What I would say is that we are in an unusual climate, and it's still unusual. And when it normalizes, which I expect it to normalize, our cost structure will revert to what it was historically, and that includes a bad debt. And as a result of that, growth could accelerate, but growth also can create cost as \u2013 well, when you are comparing it to someone who isn't growing. And so that has an impact on margins. But the overall trajectory of our business, notwithstanding the current circumstances, which are really unprecedented. The fundamental cost to serve our customers continues to come down because of our digitization of the sales and marketing and service infrastructure of the company and our ability to do self-service and self-installation. And the relative ease of delivery going forward creates long-term advantages and the cost of CPE continues to come down on a relative basis. So, we have long run trends, which are favorable to our cost structure. We have short-term trends which are favorable to our cost structure which I expect to go away. So Craig, on the stimulus, a lot of that money is undifferentiated in the States and has broadband in front of it in the nomenclature, but it's \u2013 it can go anywhere. And so yes, we are out, through our business sales services groups, trying to orient that money both to line extension and to products for schools and municipalities. And we have a full suite of products to sell. But how that money gets allocated and how it gets spent in the States is difficult to say. And I think it will vary by location. So it's a huge opportunity, as you pointed out, and it's massive. And our sense is that the States are \u2013 don't know how to spend it all. And so they are \u2013 we will see what happens, but there is an opportunity there. We \u2013 so far, we haven't done that much of that, and we like the way we are marketing it currently. We will create customers if we can retain those customers and whatever works, but we are doing well without it. And we will be on that spectrum as well. In terms of the broadband customer base, most of our customer base is on entry level package, meaning 200 megabits. So, our basic strategy has been to have a very rich broadband product as our base product. And we have continuously taken that up. And so in terms of opportunities to sell up, we have a lot of it. We haven't done much of that really. We do it. And obviously, we satisfy the market, but the bulk of our customer base is at the entry-level speed, which is quite high. Our \u2013 I am not sure I fully understood what you were going at with the passings growth. But it's really about housing starts and versus if you take out the RDOF out of it and what's that going to look like. And yes, we \u2013 our footprint pretty much looks like the United States from a statistical perspective. And so if you look at housing starts and you have an opinion on that, that will probably mirror our passings growth. Well, new developments. So that's in Florida. Jessica, the video business is under a lot of challenge, and it's going through a transformation. And we are \u2013 we have over 10 million customers now who receive our service through an application as opposed to a set-top box. And we have direct-to-consumer relationships, and we have new relationships with programmers developing that allow us to sell traditional content and bundles. We have different kinds of bundles, some are traditional cable TV packages, some are over-the-top packages and some are direct to consumers, where we are representing direct-to-consumer relationship and really essentially acting in a consignment kind of mode. So, we have every business model you can imagine going on simultaneously, which I think over the long-term creates opportunity for us. Right now, it's quite disruptive. Well, you mean how we deal with programmers from a content perspective, you mean... Well, it's going to affect the value of content. And obviously, if content comes out of bundled packages and goes direct-to-consumer, its value in the bundle goes down. Well, my hope is to have all the share over time. And so we have significant ambition. It will take a long, long time to get that. But if you do \u2013 I don't have the wireline share off the top of my head, but it's significant. It's significant. And it's oddly, we got the right to be in to compete in the telephone business, and we are a telephone company now. And that's kind of strange when you think about it. In terms of how we are communicating with regard to broadband build-out and subsidy and infrastructure subsidies, our view is that the job one is to get the un-served areas of the country served and that subsidies should be directed to do that. And we are willing to help and invest and to make that happen. And that the private capital that's been deployed in the United States in the communications networks, the capital that just got spent on Spectrum by the wireless companies and us and Comcast and the CBRS auction and the capital that's going into \u2013 that has gone into and continues to go into the communications infrastructure in the country is good and held us in good stead in \u2013 through the pandemic when we were able to operate networks at high capacity instantaneously, unlike Western Europe and other places where communication services and entertainment services were actually down rest. So, we think there is a good model there and an opportunity to serve the un-served and would like to help and be part of it. Well, luckily, it's not a material part of our business. It's difficult, and it's expensive and the prices continue to go up. It's hard to say how we could monetize it effectively over the long run. And if I understand your question, it was why do we have confidence that broadband growth will accelerate? And why \u201822 will be better than \u201821? I think that our basic view is that if you go back over the last few years that we have been on a growth track, and that growth track has been accelerating, and we had a very anomalous situation in 2020 that carries into \u201821. And that if you just sort of trend out that long-term line, it gets back on that line in \u201822. And that's really what we are saying. It's that simple."

Sir, please begin.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter's fourth quarter 2022 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. We continued to execute well within a challenging market backdrop in 2022, and we remain excited about the industry's future and Charter's in particular. We added over 340,000 Internet customers in 2022 despite the previous pandemic pull forward and a low activity environment. We also continued to see very strong mobile line growth, with full year line in net additions of over 1.7 million. As of the end of 2022, we had 5.3 million total mobile lines. So we're growing mobile lines fast even in a low volume environment by saving customers hundreds and often thousands of dollars per year. That growth creates value for Charter and supports broadband growth. For the full year, we grew our consolidated revenue by 4.5% and our adjusted EBITDA by close to 5%. The planned December management transition with Tom moving to Executive Chairman is also going very well, and I'm pleased Tom will join us in today's Q&A. In 2023, in the coming years, we remain primarily focused on three broadband initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution. Each of these initiatives is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth. Starting with evolution. Already in 2023 and over the next three years, we will evolve our network to ubiquitously offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds. We'll deploy these new speed offerings at a much faster pace and at a much cheaper cost than our competitors, just $100 per passing. And we'll maintain our marketing speed claims. We're also evolving our go-to-market approach with increasing convergence. We recently launched Spectrum One, which combines our Internet, advanced WiFi and mobile products for the fastest seamless connectivity. During the fourth quarter, we saw continued sell-in of mobile to our large Internet base, and our Spectrum One converged offering helped drive our strongest quarter yet for mobile lines. The potential for mobile to be a significant driver of new Internet sales is still largely untapped as we educate nonsubscribers of the Spectrum One value proposition. With nearly 5.3 million lines created over a four-year period, it is clear that our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn. And while some of that churn benefit may be self-selection, mobile drives better churn and ultimately, acquisitions for Charter. Our second area of focus is the expansion of our footprint. Line extension construction is an important part of our 2023 growth plan and beyond and offers good growth and returns to visibility. We hope to complete our RDOF build ahead of the original commitment, and that faster completion is good for our returns, the communities where we build, obviously, and it creates credibility for future subsidized builds and option value for future growth. As we also mentioned in December, we've been successful in winning a number of other state and local grants in 2022 and expect the same in 2023. And we expect, assuming a reasonable regulatory framework, to participate in the $42.5 billion BEAD program. The initial results of our rural construction initiative have been very promising. We constructed over 200,000 new rural passings in 2022, and penetration of passings open at least six months is ahead of our expectations at about 40%. Over time, we expect our rural construction initiative to be a significant contributor to our customer growth with attractive mid- to high-teen internal rates of return. And finally, we remain focused on executing on our core operating strategy, all to further improve customer experience, raise customer satisfaction and drive customer growth. We're doing that in a number of ways, including the continued digitization of our customer service model in ways that enhance the customer experience, accelerating our proactive maintenance initiative to address service issues before customers even see an impairment and investing in training and tenure for our employees to continue to improve our service and sales capabilities. Longer tenure leads to better execution with higher sales, lower service transactions, lower churn and more products per customer over time. So we have a large growth opportunity in front of us through network evolution, convergence and continued operational execution and a very unique opportunity to expand our footprint. We have a successful operating model to address the opportunities in front of us. It's the same strategy that we've deployed for years. It's about having the fastest connectivity and products and pricing and packaging that's difficult for customers to replicate, and putting that all together so that we provide more product into the household, more penetration across our passings and then marrying that with high-quality service with fewer service transactions and lower churn. That all drives higher long-term recurring cash flow. We then take that sustainable cash flow model and put it together with an innovative capital structure and a disciplined approach to ROI-driven capital allocation between organic investment expansion and/or M&A and buybacks, and you get Charter. So we have a great path in front of us to deliver long-term shareholder value creation, which means delivering for our customers, employees and local communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Before getting started, I want to remind you that we will be making a couple of changes to our reporting beginning next quarter. First, as we noted in our investor meeting in December, we'll include mobile service revenue in residential and SMB revenue as appropriate. We will no longer report mobile expenses separately, and both of these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and our offer structure. Second, we will provide additional line extension capital and rural disclosures. And finally, I want to note that while our fourth quarter results contain some modest impacts from Hurricane Ian, the overall impact of the hurricane on our financials and customer numbers was very small and doesn't warrant separate disclosure. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 105,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter and added 344,000 over the last 12 months. Video customers declined by 144,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 233,000 and we added a record 615,000 mobile lines. For the full year, we added 1.7 million mobile lines. Although our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the fourth quarter, activity levels remain low. During the quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total churn, voluntary churn and non-plate churn were all lower year-over-year, and we're at all-time lows for the fourth quarter. Move return remains well below pre-pandemic levels, which also reduces our selling opportunity. Gross additions remain down across the footprint by similar amounts in overbuild and non-overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. In terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless, instead of coming to us. But given the issues with fixed wireless, product reliability and scalability, we expect those customers to find their way to us over the long term. In addition, we've seen a slightly higher pace of fiber overbuild recently. And I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects. Despite these challenges with lower market activity, our Spectrum One product is working. We remain in the early stages of offering converged packages of products and refinement to our approach continues, but we're very pleased with the results. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year, with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Also keep in mind that our residential revenue and ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue, although that will change next quarter when we make the reporting adjustments I discussed a moment ago. In addition, we're allocating a portion of Spectrum One-related customer revenue from Internet to mobile revenue under GAAP. As Slide 6 shows, total residential revenue grew by 0.4% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2.4% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9.1%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was down by 3%, with lower national and local advertising revenue, driven by the softening ad market, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $876 million, with $401 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue grew by 4.9% year-over-year, mostly driven by higher rural construction initiatives subsidies, partly offset by lower processing fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year and up 4.5% for the full year 2022. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $359 million or 4.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.3% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers year-over-year, and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2023, we expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 5.3%, primarily driven by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. Cost to service customers increased by 5.8% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs, higher fuel and freight costs and higher bad debt, partly offset by productivity improvements. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 4.9%. And while bad debt was higher year-over-year, it remained below pre-COVID level. As we noted in our December investor meeting, we're making very targeted adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits and career paths inside of our operations teams in order to build an even higher skilled and more tenured workforce, which drove the higher labor costs. These adjustments will add some pressure year-over-year to cost to service customers expense growth in the first half of this year. But that year-over-year growth should moderate in the second half of 2023. And we continue to expect additional efficiencies in cost to service customers over time as a result of the continued digitization of service, productivity improvements and our network evolution investment.  Marketing expense grew by 6.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the higher staffing levels I mentioned and wages, which included targeted adjustments in our sales channels. Mobile expenses totaled $982 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 6.6%, primarily driven by higher labor costs and higher advertising sales expense related to higher political revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.9% year-over-year in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year 2022. Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter compared to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, with higher income tax and interest expense more than offsetting higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year 2022. Our total CapEx for the year reflects the timing of more accelerated equipment inventory receipts in December than expected. Fourth quarter capital spending of $2.9 billion rose above last year's fourth quarter spend of $2.1 billion, primarily driven by higher line extension spend driven by our rural construction initiative. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, increased from $1.6 billion in last year's fourth quarter to $2 billion this quarter, driven by investment in network evolution, higher customer premise equipment spend on advanced WiFi equipment and timing of spend. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. So excluding line extensions, we expect a small increase year-over-year in capital spend driven by the acceleration of network evolution spending and partly offset by declines in other areas. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 level and continue to decline thereafter. Turning to line extensions. In 2023, we expect line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations, assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending. We also expect most BEAD money to begin to be appropriated in the 2024 timeframe with four-year build timelines from grants. At that time, we expect that our RDOF spend will begin to ramp down. We expect the BEAD program to present a unique and attractive opportunity for us to expand our network with subsidies, generating significant returns that solidly exceed our cost of capital. For our additional subsidized passings, we expect our net rural construction cost per passing to be closer to the roughly $3,000 per passing that we've incurred in our recent subsidized state and local builds than to our RDOF per passing costs. Our six-month penetration of passings in our newly built rural areas continues to be around 40%, and we expect penetrations in these areas to continue to grow. If you use the cost per passing that I mentioned a moment ago, a high broadband penetration assumption, which we think is reasonable, our current ARPU, excluding mobile, a high incremental margin based on low incremental overhead costs and a reasonable terminal multiple or perpetuity growth rate, you can clearly see the very attractive IRRs associated with our rural builds. Turning to Slide 10. We generated $1.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, mostly the result of our rural construction initiatives and by higher cash tax payments. For the full year, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow versus $8.7 billion in 2021. However, excluding cash taxes and our rural construction initiative, our full year free cash flow grew by 4%. We finished the quarter with $97.4 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1.3 billion at an average price of $344 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 23.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling approximately $11.7 billion. We have a proven operating balance sheet and capital allocation model that drives customer and financial growth and shareholder value. We've always prioritized investments that generate long-term growth, and those investments ultimately protect and extend our return of capital to shareholders. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and intend to both invest for long-term growth and simultaneously returned excess capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street.\nJonathan Chaplin : I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more context around the strength we saw in wireless this quarter. How much of that is coming from selling into your existing base of customers versus new customers that you're bringing in the door? And really what I'm sort of trying to unpack is some way to kind of analyze the pull-through effect that the Spectrum One is having on broadband acquisition, separate from sort of the impact it has on lowering churn. And then you said that the opportunity for sort of driving this converged bundle is really untapped at this stage. Can you remind us of what penetration is of accounts with wireless at the moment? And where you think that could sort of potentially get to in the long term?\nChristopher Winfrey : And on the second question, Jonathan, I don't have the exact in front of me, but it's 3 million relationships roughly that have mobile and take the residential base of, what, 28 million, I guess you got to take SMB together so 30. So that gives you a sense there. On the impact of Spectrum One, I think the potential here for acquisition remains the biggest opportunity in terms of driving Internet net adds. Our wireless net additions in the quarter were largely driven by existing Internet upgrades still. So 75%, 80% of the lines came from existing Internet customers upgrading, which means they're paying lines, maybe get the second line for free or the third line paid for the majority of those being paying lines, which means the inverse of that is that new connects are also attaching with mobile as well. Even new connects -- new Internet connects are connected with mobile as well, although we're in a low transaction environment, which means we have lower gross adds. So there's a mathematical opportunity to increase both our Internet net adds and our convergence with even more mobile line adds as the market picks up. But there's the bigger opportunity, which is as we continue to message into the marketplace, the value and the benefits of a converged product, which really across our footprint, we're the only provider who can have those claims and have that better product and have that what we call gig-powered wireless. I think the real opportunity for Spectrum One convergence and wireless is to have a meaningful impact over time on Internet net additions, but it's early on. And I think because it's a completely new category, it's going to take a little while to educate into the marketplace. And the bulk of our wireless gains today are still coming from existing Internet customer upgrades.\nJonathan Chaplin : Chris, do you have a sense of how many of the broadband adds you might not have got, but for the Spectrum One offer with wireless?\nChristopher Winfrey : It's a tricky question because the customers are going in for a sale, and we're attaching global Internet at the same time. So I think the easier way to think about it is to think about our progression between Q3 and Q4 with a few caveats. One is there's always seasonality. Those are decent quarters typically in a year. The second caveat is that when you have a large amount of adds and a large amount of disconnects inside the business, which all of us do, that can create outsized variability and outsized conclusions on your net adds because of small -- a very small difference in your gross adds or a small difference in your churn can have an outsized impact on your net adds. Now as we hopefully return to a higher net add growth rate and that variability declines, but that mass still remains. So from a Q4 perspective, we still have low transaction volume for all the reasons that Jessica mentioned. And we had the other factors that Jessica mentioned, so people should go back to that. But the bridge between 75,000 roughly Internet net adds in Q3, we had a little more rural that was behind us, and Spectrum One was contributing as well. And I think both of those were contributors to the small uptick that we saw in Q4. The bigger issue we face, as we keep on saying, is just the lower transaction volume in the marketplace, means fewer selling opportunities -- which means fewer selling opportunities for Spectrum One and at the same time as we educate the marketplace on the benefits of that converged product.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI.\nVijay Jayant : A couple for Jessica. Just wanted to confirm that the 4 billion of line extension you're calling out for '24, '25, that's sort of the other limit, assuming that you win in BEAD and it could be potentially low? Is that sort of a budgeting sort of expectation just for clarification? And then given the higher sort of CapEx you have next few years, can you help us think about what it means on taxes? Is there sort of new shield that we can get from the build?\nJessica Fischer : Yes. So the $4 billion, Vijay, I do think that it's kind of a budgeting exercise, but it's our expectation, and it's on the higher end of our expectations. But it all matters how much we win and subsidized builds. And so it really is a matter of sort of what's available and what makes sense from an ROI perspective for us to spend and to try to get additional passings and generate additional returns. But I think the $4 billion is where we think that we will be based on our expectation of what will happen right now. So that's probably the way to think about that. On the cash tax, our cash tax liability is always dependent on a number of different variables. We're a full cash taxpayer now. We've previously given guidance on taxes. If you look back, I think, at what we said in Q4 of 2021, and there's more CapEx in the plan now, which generally should reduce that liability. But because you don't have 100% deductibility, you don't get 100% credit for that anymore. As a result, I would look back at that guidance. And we might be slightly above the percentages that we gave there, maybe 1% or 2% higher, but you can generally sort of look back to that to think about how to estimate cash tax.\nChristopher Winfrey : So Vijay, on the rural build, clearly, we've disclosed what we've won so far on the state grants that primarily come out of ARPA and NTIA funds. The BEAD process is still in process. And so the rules have not been fully clarified. They need to be right in order for it to make sense for us to invest, and we think they will. But then once the maps are clarified, contested, then there will be grants given out to the states in terms of how the funds are distributed. And then the states will have their own process in terms of how they allocate that. So in some sense, our outlook here is really dependent on the rules that get set, the timing of the allocation to the state and then how the states distribute. And so we're trying to do our best to provide some outlook based on the best view that we have today. But a lot of that's not entirely in our hands, and we're going to do the best we can. And we'll continue to provide updates along the way to the extent that we have better information.\nStefan Anninger : Chelsea, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with SVB MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett : Two questions, if I could. First, let's drill down on margins a little bit. I think it's hard for all of us to sort of make sense of the wireless margins given how fast the subscriber base is growing and therefore, how high customer acquisition costs might be. How should we think about -- particularly since we're not going to see it reported separately anymore, how should we think about the margin trajectory for wireless and therefore, the margin trajectory for the business overall as you go forward? And then just one more operating question. Can you just talk about the decision in your upgrade of your physical plant to not go all the way to symmetrical speeds, but to keep your downstream speeds higher than your upstream speeds?\nJessica Fischer : So Craig, on the margins question, I would tell you, first off, we wouldn't be willing to do the Spectrum One offer if we didn't have some space in margin. And so our margins in that business, if you exclude the subscriber acquisition costs, continue to be quite good. And they're getting better over time because we continue to drive down some of those business expenses on a per customer basis, things like the operating cost, what does it take to run billing and customer care. And actually, the reason that we're pushing those into our broader reporting is that we continue to integrate the business into our broader business. And so a lot of that activity we're dealing with a customer as one customer. And when you have a sales call, you're selling mobile and cable on the same call. When you have somebody call in with a question, you have agents who we'll be capable of dealing with both things. But I think the overall trajectory, we make margin on the customers today. We have offers in the mix that we're using to drive both mobile and broadband activity, but they work well for that. And I think we should think about them as being related to both that mobile and broadband activity. But we expect the margins to continue to grow. I think we gave some numbers in the presentation in December, and you can kind of see the trajectory that we're on there. I think that margin expansion continues when you think about the broader product.\nChristopher Winfrey : I'll comment a little bit on the network question. And the -- so your question was whether the choice to not upgrade to symmetrical. Just as a reminder for everybody, the first 15% of the upgrade is going to be with DOCSIS 3.1 high split using integrated CMTS. That will give us 2 -- up to 2 by 1, 15% footprint. So if we can make that one by one, we could make that somewhere in between and make it symmetrical. But -- so we have the capabilities. It's just based on our assessment of where the market value is. 5 by 1 in the 50% of the footprint. And then what we think is a base case is 10 by 1, using 1.8 gigahertz DOCSIS 4.0 RPD in 35% of the footprint. Now -- the reason we're choosing that you can mix and match where you allocate your bandwidth based on what you think the customer demand, the marketing claims and the actual product and device capabilities are. So we have flexibility to make, for example, you can make a symmetrical speed of product out there, depending on where you set the split. And those options remain available to us. It's our view right now that the upstream demand today is much more of a marketing campaign as opposed to any real product demand. And we want to lead in those marketing claims, which is why we're doing what we're doing. We also have from a marketing claims perspective from a symmetrical that what we'll be deploying here allows a fiber drop in the -- as a remote OLT inside of the node. So that gives us marketing claims across the entire footprint for 25 symmetrical and over time, 50 or 100-gig symmetrical. Hard to imagine what, when and how that would ever be needed, but it gives us the opportunity to do that and market it at least in these communities to have that type of speed, not different from what we do with enterprise already today. So we have a lot of flexibility. That's what I think we really like about this plan. We can go fast. We can do it at a low cost. We can reset the up and downstream, and we can pivot where we need to go at a very attractive price. We can do it at a faster pace and a cheaper cost than all of our competitors and be out in front of any potential overbuild with a better product for the long term.\nThomas Rutledge : And Craig, this is Tom. I just want to add one thought to you the margin. The gross margin of the mobile business is actually a high-margin business. And it's improving with penetration, and it improves both at the gross level and the operating level. And relative to video, which is a low-margin business and declining, but has an impact on -- as the revenues decline in video has an impact on margin in a positive way, even more dramatically is the impact of the increased revenues that are coming in from mobile and the high margins associated with them. So the overall margin in the business is improving going forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhilip Cusick : I wonder if, Chris -- two, if I can. One, Chris, can you just talk about the broadband market? Is penetration in your legacy footprint growing? And talk about the -- what you mentioned was incremental fiber competition and how that sort of evolves over time? And then second, Jessica, you gave a ton of detail on costs, and I appreciate it. Can you just quantify a little bit for us that increase in cost of service in the first half as well as the programming cost commentary, a lot of people wondering how are some programming numbers are flat in '23?\nChristopher Winfrey : So Phil, let me parse the market a little bit in the broadband market. Clearly, in areas where we don't have a gig overlap, we are growing and continue to grow despite a low transaction volume marketplace. And despite some of the rollback to post-pandemic rollback to mobile-only that Jessica described. I don't think it will go all the way back, but we're all seeing a little bit of that taking place. So growing in that space. Typically in a gig overlap area, you have newly minted overbuild and you have existing overbuilt and existing overbuild we're growing and newly minted. You have a small setback upfront because you have just have a new competitor in the marketplace. And to the extent you have a higher amount of that, that mix impacts where you're going. In the fourth quarter, based on all the passings analysis that we look at, we actually grew despite that higher fiber overbuild inside of our footprint in the fourth quarter, we actually grew in that space despite the mix contribution of additional overbuild. So I think that's positive. And so that's -- it's small. And as you can tell through the net add numbers. But I think it's promising for the future, and that's even prior to having the benefit of additional marketing claims through the network evolution as well as having clearly the wind behind our sales over time of additional network expansion and the promise of having a fundamentally different and better product than any of our competitors can have through a converged offering that has gig powered wireless. So those initiatives, they won't happen inside of Q1 or Q2, but they'll continue to steadily increase and improve our position and ability to grow. The biggest one would be, if we can get market volume coming back, that would actually be the biggest contributor of growth more than any of the things that I just mentioned. I'd note as a tangential and somebody will ask it, and so I'll comment on it. We have not -- as we've talked about, we've not seen any demonstrable impact on our churn as it relates to fixed wireless access. And we think it could have had some impact on our gross adds, particularly on ads that we would have pulled from DSL. But when some pricing actions were taken in December, we saw for the first time a very limited impact on our voluntary term, but not where you would have expected it. It's actually in our non-gig overlap and in our MDU footprint where you have higher churn to customers, higher tendency to move around, higher tendency to non-pay. And so it was a -- maybe it's just a blip, but there's two linings to that. One is that, for the first time, we saw a small amount of churn related to that. And the flip side is those customers tend to be very mobile, if you will. And I think given the experience of that product even more so are used for the return of them coming back to a proper broadband product with or without convergence. So anyway, that's just food for thought around that. I hope that answers the question.\nJessica Fischer : So on your other two questions, in cost to serve, quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4 was 5.8%. I would expect Q1 to look more like -- to look a bit like that. And then for it to sort of the year-over-year growth to decrease across the year until you're more in line with the sort of growth trajectory that we've seen before, which is really largely flat. For programming per sub cost, the reason that they remain flat year-over-year that, that's our expectation, really has to do with customer mix and whether customers are taking sort of packages that have larger channel sets or more premiums or whether they continue to be priced out of those packages and come into some skinnier packages where the programming cost per sub is less. So it's a mix issue, certainly not an issue that programmers are no longer raising rates.\nPhilip Cusick : We used to talk about them.\nChristopher Winfrey : Go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick : Sorry. No, I was just going to ask, do you have some room on -- we used to talk about the sort of small video package mix and how that might peak out at some point? Is that an issue anymore? Or can you kind of put people wherever you want in terms of packages?\nChristopher Winfrey : Maybe we'll ham and egg this between Tom and myself. But I want to go into talking about what we have headroom, and we have the ability to still create packages that create value for consumers. Our philosophy has always been to give the customers what they want. And typically, they want more programming and try to do that the best price we can. And so -- also based on their capacity of their wallet. And so having some of these packages actually allows us to sell more video product, which is to the benefit of the programmers. And that's -- you can see it in the results that we have still losses, but it's a lot lower than losses than other people in the marketplace. And that's a result of our ability to drive video based on what the consumer wants and what they can pay, and sometimes those are in conflict. So I think the -- that model has worked. It will continue to work. But I also think it already for -- as we look to the video space in the future, programmers need to see what we're doing and say, given where we are and given what they're doing themselves with direct-to-consumer and OTC effectively unbundling themselves. But if we had that package flexibility further than we do today, I think we could actually solve some of the problem that exists in the video space and grow for the benefit of programmers, but it's difficult for them to get their heads around that.\nThomas Rutledge : It is. So I guess I'm ham or the egg, I'm not sure what you want me to be. We still have limitations on what we can do contractually, but we've been moving those limitations as we renew contracts. But the industry is structurally in a bad place from a video perspective, and you've got a really high-priced fat package with everything in it. And there are a lot of content companies whose pricing is a lot less and it separated out from that package can create a lot of value for consumers. But obviously, it's a different model. It requires different selling. And so we've been trying within those limitations to do what Chris said, which is to have the best product we can. But I would say that it's not a solved situation in terms of the way the marketplace is structured. And it's still structured in a way that continues to make video an expensive product for most consumers.\nChristopher Winfrey : I think Xumo could help. That's the design. Xumo could help a lot with that. If you take the very best of the Comcast platform, including the voice remote and pair that up in our footprint with Spectrum TV app and live video with all the different packages that we have that can be tailored to consumers appetite as well as their budget and combined with what they're probably already paying through SVOD, DTC, et cetera, in a single platform that allows them to consumed the video product in a single place with unified search, discovery, voice remote, both live as well as all the other content they have. I think that's pretty powerful. And to the extent that we're able to continue to change the requirements that Tom talked about in our programming agreements, I think we can sell more.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets.\nKutgun Maral : I just wanted to follow up on the programming cost discussion, and then I had a quick housekeeping item on mobile, if I can. So on programming costs, the guide for it to be flat year-over-year is quite remarkable in many ways. Jessica, I know you just characterized it as a mix issue. I wanted to see if you're seeing an acceleration in subs taking these lighter packages or cord shaving overall.  And relatedly, you've been very vocal about the tensions with programmers for many years now. Is there anything else to call out in terms of Charter maybe taking a harder line with programmers and recent renegotiations, whether it's in terms of pricing or even carriage of certain networks overall? Or maybe again, we shouldn't read into it, and it's purely just a consumer mix shift issue?  And quickly, just a housekeeping question on wireless, as we all try to better understand the industry-wide postpaid phone trends, any chance you could help size how much of your 5.3 million mobile lines are phone versus tablets?\nChristopher Winfrey : I don't have it in front of me that split on the 5.3 million, but the vast, vast majority, we're in the connectivity business, and so we're selling mobile service. And to the extent that a customer wants additional devices, of course, we have that and we make it available. But our view here is driving Internet both acquisition as well as Internet churn and to drive profitability, but having an overall higher ARPU and you get that through selling the mobile service combined with the broadband service. Maybe you start with programming and jump...\nJessica Fischer : Yes. To clarify, on the guidance, it's programming cost per sub that is flat year-over-year. And the mix shift is not that that significantly different from what we have seen previously. The base is smaller. And so as the base -- the mix of incoming customers does differ from the base, but the mix shift isn't -- it's not that substantially different.\nChristopher Winfrey : In terms of position with programmers, Tom mentioned the margin issue that exists inside of video. And we've talked about the availability of that content really almost anywhere, in some cases, in many cases, for free because of piracy. We've been a long proponent Tom has been around the problems related to that. So I guess it's fair to say I don't know about harder line. It's just more indifferent about carriage of certain content at a higher increasing price when it's available all across the market at cheaper rates or even for free. And so that's not a harder line, that's just a reality of where we're at.  The two biggest issues inside of the content category continued to be retrans, which is over-the-air content, which we're forced to pass on as a significant cost to our customers. And the development of sports and the other channels are important and put into what I was just describing, but those are the two biggest drivers of cost increases to consumer.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse.\nDouglas Mitchelson : I think at the Analyst Day, it was suggested that broadband net adds would be better in 2023 than 2022, and that 2023 would have EBITDA growth. And so I'm just wondering, I think, Chris, on the broadband net add side, kind of what gives you confidence that 2023 could be better than 2022? And then I guess, jump all, but maybe for Jessica, on EBITDA, do I remember that right? The expectation is EBITDA growth in 2023? And I know you guys are in a fan of guidance, but any -- what are the swing factors that can impact that? And any thoughts on cadence if you're willing to offer would be helpful. And then -- sorry, just -- I'll ask it all at once. Chris, I'm just curious as a follow-up. You said the pricing action, it was maybe just a blip that it was like the first time. But you've -- when you've had pricing actions in the past, you've had churn, right? So I wasn't sure what was -- what you saw for the first time when you mentioned a blip in churn?\nChristopher Winfrey : Yes. The 2023 broadband net adds, I said our goal is to have higher broadband net adds this year, and I think we will. The biggest variable that's out there is what's taking place in terms of market transaction volume, and that's the only one that gives me angst because it's the one you can't control. But we have a lot of things going in our favour, the -- starting with a lot of these initiatives that I've talked about. So clearly, with a bigger base of rural passings behind us and constructed increasing during the course of the year, I think the early -- small but early success of Spectrum One in driving Internet is only going to grow as that product takes hold. And I think the investments that we've made in our personnel, not to get too much into the weeds, but that labor cost increase that Jessica talked about, there are some pretty big actions that we took that were targeted. They were not peanut butter wage increases. They were targeted to drive an ROI, which means having longer-tenured employees who result in the sales force having better yields, selling better. And in the service infrastructure by having a longer tenure, they tend to do a better and faster job in addressing customer issues and avoid repeats, which not only reduces transactions, but reduces customer churn over time. And those benefits, because of where the labor market was for everybody last year, in order to get tenured investors the passage of time, but we've seen the lowest attrition rates at the back end of Q4 that I've seen in a very, very long time, if ever, in our service and sales functions. And I think that's going to -- that's a function of both the market as well as the investments that we've made. But ultimately, those investments collectively tie into both gross adds as well as to lower churn. And I'll go back to where I started, which is the biggest driver for us and the biggest uncertainty is market volume. But all else equal, that's our goal is to increase net adds this year.\nJessica Fischer : On the EBITDA side, as you said, we don't give EBITDA guidance, but certainly, we do expect growth in 2023. I think I drive it out of a few things. We have continued to have customer growth. I think we've talked about on the rate side. We have taken some small rate actions recently. And then we continue to believe that we have -- we continue to expect rates to be good across those customers. So driving revenue growth. I would remind you that we lapped last year's rate increases in April. So to your comment around timing, the second quarter is probably the space in which that's most challenged. But -- and then as Chris said, we've made these investments in tenure. We expect to gain better efficiencies both out of the tenure initiative, out of the continued digitization of the process that we have. We continue to improve in our operational efficiency, which drives sort of relative costs out of the business. And so I think we're pretty confident in generating that EBITDA growth year-over-year.\nChristopher Winfrey : You mentioned pricing action and maybe there was some confusion there, but I'll start with what we've done. We -- our philosophy hasn't changed. We're focused on trying to provide competitive products at the best price in the market and best packaging so that we can grow faster. But given what's happened in the video space, we continue to pass through rate increases for the programming increases that we've seen. And if you look back to the middle of last year, you can see it pretty dramatic, given where the economy was and if you're on people's mind, we did a pass-through in the middle of the year. You saw a big downgrade in video and voice. We've done some additional pass-through as well as a small increase on Internet lower than our competitors to maintain our competitiveness. And we did that for Internet-only inside of Q4, and we wanted to wait until you could combine that from a service experience, not to have the bill change twice for customers. So bundled Internet customers is just taking place at the beginning of -- bundled video with Internet customers taking place at the beginning of this year. The reaction there has been pretty muted. It's very low call volume, and given where the rest of the market has been and what we're doing is still maintaining our competitiveness. I am not seeing a big uptick in churns related to the price actions that we pass through.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne : A few questions on the rural build. Jessica, thanks for all that detail at the beginning on the sort of non-RDOF pieces. I think you talked about $3,000 of passing net. So I guess a couple of things. Should we think about that as 5,000 gross? And do you guys have visibility into the timing of when you'll receive those subsidies and also sort of the accounting treatment revenue versus CapEx, so we can think about trying to give you those benefits as we layer on the spending? And then I don't know if you're willing to tell us what you think you'll build in '23. I'm guessing, no, but we can make our own assumptions. If we think you're going to build to, say, 500,000 rural passings in '23, is there any way to help us think about how many of those you'll sell into over the course of the year? I assume at this point, you guys are getting better at turning this stuff on and getting to market. So any help on the timeline and lag from what you've learned so far would be helpful.\nJessica Fischer : Yes. So I'm going to start at the bottom of the list, Ben. We expect to build around 300,000 subsidized rural passings in 2023, which are mostly RDOF and they're incremental to the normal business as usual pace of build. What I would do with those is we've given you information on how much penetration we get of those passings, the 40% at six months. We continue to grow after we hit that 40% at six months, but you can time them in that way. Our pace coming into the end of the year within the 15,000 to 20,000 passings per month range, and I would expect -- we're starting the year at that pace and we're going to end at a faster pace to get to that total of 300,000 number. The $3,000 per passing, so just to be clear, I think what I said was that we would be closer to the $3,000 that we've been in the more recent subsidized builds than to our RDOF amount. So we\u2019re totally prescriptive around $3,000 exactly. But that is a net number. Our expectation on state subsidized and on the BEAD build is that those programs are likely to be structured in a way where the expenses count -- where the subsidies are accounted for as a capital offset and not as revenue. So we're going at it with net numbers. Gross build costs, I think, are a lot harder. And so we understand quite a bit now about what we need to -- about what we want in terms of driving economics and also sort of had some experience in bidding these passings and are seeing what's happening in the marketplace. But what you win impacts a lot about what those gross build costs are and they could be in a pretty wide range. So I don't have a number on that side.\nChristopher Winfrey : Just in terms of how we look at it, Ben. If you go back to the presentation that we used in December, I threw up an unnamed market with a footprint overlap. So you could take a look at how our strategy evolves between, I think, the colors were gray, gold and blue. Between our existing footprint, RDOF and the way that state grants and now BEAD and other grants we\u2019ll be doing. And so we can make the gross cost of our build lower as a result of the strategy in terms of how we approach the market and how we put these together. And so we can have a lower gross cost and therefore lower net cost than our competitors because of the existing footprint that we have, the existing or footprint that we're building. And I think that makes us not only a better economic participant, but a better and more reliable, trustworthy builder for the states in the build because we're the largest rural builder today. We've been successful at it. We're moving at a fast pace. We can get broadband to their constituents at a faster pace at a competitive price with great products, Internet and mobile, and most of these bidders aren't going to have mobile and they're not going to have a converged product, and that's something that we can bring to these communities.\nBenjamin Swinburne : That's very helpful. Can I just ask a clarification from your comment. I think you guys talked about nonpaid churn, all forms of churn at record lows in Q4, including non-pay. But I think you also mentioned bad debt was coming back up. Just any comment on sort of the consumer, the low-end consumer. Some of your competitors have talked about non-pay churn normalizing. Was -- it didn't sound like we're seeing that, but I wanted to hear your thoughts?\nChristopher Winfrey : I think I'll let Jessica comment. It's still dramatically -- well, it's still much lower than it was pre-pandemic, and the churn is low. Bad debt has been slowly building back up. It's nowhere near back to where it was, but it has an impact on a year-over-year basis. In January, we typically don't talk to intra-quarter, we don't like to. But we're starting to see, and that may be the bridge between what some of our peers and competitors are saying. It's not dramatic, but we have seen a step up both in non-pay as well as bad debt. And I think that just reflects the overall economy. In some sense, you look at that and the upfront impact of that is negative. You don't like it. On the other hand, it's one of the indicators that the market is starting to normalize in terms of transaction volumes, you have a delay from when the bad news comes in and when the selling opportunity arises. So it's a double-edged sword.\nJessica Fischer : Yes. The other piece I would remind you we've talked about before, we're a big participant in ACP and a big proponent of that program. I think for our customers that are more prone to non-pay. We've endeavored to make sure that they recognize that, that program is available to them and to be part of the solution they're making Internet affordable for them.  It has two impacts. One is that those customers don't churn as much as before. The other impact, though, is that on some of those customers that convert into the ACP program. We might be carrying a balance related to those customers that then ends up sort of flushing through in our bad debt computation. So while bad debt is higher on a numerical value basis, it's not necessarily connecting into a non-pay churn where we've converted the customer to being an ACP customer.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. Operator, that concludes our call.\nChristopher Winfrey : Thank you, everyone.\nJessica Fischer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. We continued to execute well within a challenging market backdrop in 2022, and we remain excited about the industry's future and Charter's in particular. We added over 340,000 Internet customers in 2022 despite the previous pandemic pull forward and a low activity environment. We also continued to see very strong mobile line growth, with full year line in net additions of over 1.7 million. As of the end of 2022, we had 5.3 million total mobile lines. So we're growing mobile lines fast even in a low volume environment by saving customers hundreds and often thousands of dollars per year. That growth creates value for Charter and supports broadband growth. For the full year, we grew our consolidated revenue by 4.5% and our adjusted EBITDA by close to 5%. The planned December management transition with Tom moving to Executive Chairman is also going very well, and I'm pleased Tom will join us in today's Q&A. In 2023, in the coming years, we remain primarily focused on three broadband initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution. Each of these initiatives is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth. Starting with evolution. Already in 2023 and over the next three years, we will evolve our network to ubiquitously offer symmetrical and multi-gigabit speeds. We'll deploy these new speed offerings at a much faster pace and at a much cheaper cost than our competitors, just $100 per passing. And we'll maintain our marketing speed claims. We're also evolving our go-to-market approach with increasing convergence. We recently launched Spectrum One, which combines our Internet, advanced WiFi and mobile products for the fastest seamless connectivity. During the fourth quarter, we saw continued sell-in of mobile to our large Internet base, and our Spectrum One converged offering helped drive our strongest quarter yet for mobile lines. The potential for mobile to be a significant driver of new Internet sales is still largely untapped as we educate nonsubscribers of the Spectrum One value proposition. With nearly 5.3 million lines created over a four-year period, it is clear that our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn. And while some of that churn benefit may be self-selection, mobile drives better churn and ultimately, acquisitions for Charter. Our second area of focus is the expansion of our footprint. Line extension construction is an important part of our 2023 growth plan and beyond and offers good growth and returns to visibility. We hope to complete our RDOF build ahead of the original commitment, and that faster completion is good for our returns, the communities where we build, obviously, and it creates credibility for future subsidized builds and option value for future growth. As we also mentioned in December, we've been successful in winning a number of other state and local grants in 2022 and expect the same in 2023. And we expect, assuming a reasonable regulatory framework, to participate in the $42.5 billion BEAD program. The initial results of our rural construction initiative have been very promising. We constructed over 200,000 new rural passings in 2022, and penetration of passings open at least six months is ahead of our expectations at about 40%. Over time, we expect our rural construction initiative to be a significant contributor to our customer growth with attractive mid- to high-teen internal rates of return. And finally, we remain focused on executing on our core operating strategy, all to further improve customer experience, raise customer satisfaction and drive customer growth. We're doing that in a number of ways, including the continued digitization of our customer service model in ways that enhance the customer experience, accelerating our proactive maintenance initiative to address service issues before customers even see an impairment and investing in training and tenure for our employees to continue to improve our service and sales capabilities. Longer tenure leads to better execution with higher sales, lower service transactions, lower churn and more products per customer over time. So we have a large growth opportunity in front of us through network evolution, convergence and continued operational execution and a very unique opportunity to expand our footprint. We have a successful operating model to address the opportunities in front of us. It's the same strategy that we've deployed for years. It's about having the fastest connectivity and products and pricing and packaging that's difficult for customers to replicate, and putting that all together so that we provide more product into the household, more penetration across our passings and then marrying that with high-quality service with fewer service transactions and lower churn. That all drives higher long-term recurring cash flow. We then take that sustainable cash flow model and put it together with an innovative capital structure and a disciplined approach to ROI-driven capital allocation between organic investment expansion and/or M&A and buybacks, and you get Charter. So we have a great path in front of us to deliver long-term shareholder value creation, which means delivering for our customers, employees and local communities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. And on the second question, Jonathan, I don't have the exact in front of me, but it's 3 million relationships roughly that have mobile and take the residential base of, what, 28 million, I guess you got to take SMB together so 30. So that gives you a sense there. On the impact of Spectrum One, I think the potential here for acquisition remains the biggest opportunity in terms of driving Internet net adds. Our wireless net additions in the quarter were largely driven by existing Internet upgrades still. So 75%, 80% of the lines came from existing Internet customers upgrading, which means they're paying lines, maybe get the second line for free or the third line paid for the majority of those being paying lines, which means the inverse of that is that new connects are also attaching with mobile as well. Even new connects -- new Internet connects are connected with mobile as well, although we're in a low transaction environment, which means we have lower gross adds. So there's a mathematical opportunity to increase both our Internet net adds and our convergence with even more mobile line adds as the market picks up. But there's the bigger opportunity, which is as we continue to message into the marketplace, the value and the benefits of a converged product, which really across our footprint, we're the only provider who can have those claims and have that better product and have that what we call gig-powered wireless. I think the real opportunity for Spectrum One convergence and wireless is to have a meaningful impact over time on Internet net additions, but it's early on. And I think because it's a completely new category, it's going to take a little while to educate into the marketplace. And the bulk of our wireless gains today are still coming from existing Internet customer upgrades. It's a tricky question because the customers are going in for a sale, and we're attaching global Internet at the same time. So I think the easier way to think about it is to think about our progression between Q3 and Q4 with a few caveats. One is there's always seasonality. Those are decent quarters typically in a year. The second caveat is that when you have a large amount of adds and a large amount of disconnects inside the business, which all of us do, that can create outsized variability and outsized conclusions on your net adds because of small -- a very small difference in your gross adds or a small difference in your churn can have an outsized impact on your net adds. Now as we hopefully return to a higher net add growth rate and that variability declines, but that mass still remains. So from a Q4 perspective, we still have low transaction volume for all the reasons that Jessica mentioned. And we had the other factors that Jessica mentioned, so people should go back to that. But the bridge between 75,000 roughly Internet net adds in Q3, we had a little more rural that was behind us, and Spectrum One was contributing as well. And I think both of those were contributors to the small uptick that we saw in Q4. The bigger issue we face, as we keep on saying, is just the lower transaction volume in the marketplace, means fewer selling opportunities -- which means fewer selling opportunities for Spectrum One and at the same time as we educate the marketplace on the benefits of that converged product. So Vijay, on the rural build, clearly, we've disclosed what we've won so far on the state grants that primarily come out of ARPA and NTIA funds. The BEAD process is still in process. And so the rules have not been fully clarified. They need to be right in order for it to make sense for us to invest, and we think they will. But then once the maps are clarified, contested, then there will be grants given out to the states in terms of how the funds are distributed. And then the states will have their own process in terms of how they allocate that. So in some sense, our outlook here is really dependent on the rules that get set, the timing of the allocation to the state and then how the states distribute. And so we're trying to do our best to provide some outlook based on the best view that we have today. But a lot of that's not entirely in our hands, and we're going to do the best we can. And we'll continue to provide updates along the way to the extent that we have better information. I'll comment a little bit on the network question. And the -- so your question was whether the choice to not upgrade to symmetrical. Just as a reminder for everybody, the first 15% of the upgrade is going to be with DOCSIS 3.1 high split using integrated CMTS. That will give us 2 -- up to 2 by 1, 15% footprint. So if we can make that one by one, we could make that somewhere in between and make it symmetrical. But -- so we have the capabilities. It's just based on our assessment of where the market value is. 5 by 1 in the 50% of the footprint. And then what we think is a base case is 10 by 1, using 1.8 gigahertz DOCSIS 4.0 RPD in 35% of the footprint. Now -- the reason we're choosing that you can mix and match where you allocate your bandwidth based on what you think the customer demand, the marketing claims and the actual product and device capabilities are. So we have flexibility to make, for example, you can make a symmetrical speed of product out there, depending on where you set the split. And those options remain available to us. It's our view right now that the upstream demand today is much more of a marketing campaign as opposed to any real product demand. And we want to lead in those marketing claims, which is why we're doing what we're doing. We also have from a marketing claims perspective from a symmetrical that what we'll be deploying here allows a fiber drop in the -- as a remote OLT inside of the node. So that gives us marketing claims across the entire footprint for 25 symmetrical and over time, 50 or 100-gig symmetrical. Hard to imagine what, when and how that would ever be needed, but it gives us the opportunity to do that and market it at least in these communities to have that type of speed, not different from what we do with enterprise already today. So we have a lot of flexibility. That's what I think we really like about this plan. We can go fast. We can do it at a low cost. We can reset the up and downstream, and we can pivot where we need to go at a very attractive price. We can do it at a faster pace and a cheaper cost than all of our competitors and be out in front of any potential overbuild with a better product for the long term. So Phil, let me parse the market a little bit in the broadband market. Clearly, in areas where we don't have a gig overlap, we are growing and continue to grow despite a low transaction volume marketplace. And despite some of the rollback to post-pandemic rollback to mobile-only that Jessica described. I don't think it will go all the way back, but we're all seeing a little bit of that taking place. So growing in that space. Typically in a gig overlap area, you have newly minted overbuild and you have existing overbuilt and existing overbuild we're growing and newly minted. You have a small setback upfront because you have just have a new competitor in the marketplace. And to the extent you have a higher amount of that, that mix impacts where you're going. In the fourth quarter, based on all the passings analysis that we look at, we actually grew despite that higher fiber overbuild inside of our footprint in the fourth quarter, we actually grew in that space despite the mix contribution of additional overbuild. So I think that's positive. And so that's -- it's small. And as you can tell through the net add numbers. But I think it's promising for the future, and that's even prior to having the benefit of additional marketing claims through the network evolution as well as having clearly the wind behind our sales over time of additional network expansion and the promise of having a fundamentally different and better product than any of our competitors can have through a converged offering that has gig powered wireless. So those initiatives, they won't happen inside of Q1 or Q2, but they'll continue to steadily increase and improve our position and ability to grow. The biggest one would be, if we can get market volume coming back, that would actually be the biggest contributor of growth more than any of the things that I just mentioned. I'd note as a tangential and somebody will ask it, and so I'll comment on it. We have not -- as we've talked about, we've not seen any demonstrable impact on our churn as it relates to fixed wireless access. And we think it could have had some impact on our gross adds, particularly on ads that we would have pulled from DSL. But when some pricing actions were taken in December, we saw for the first time a very limited impact on our voluntary term, but not where you would have expected it. It's actually in our non-gig overlap and in our MDU footprint where you have higher churn to customers, higher tendency to move around, higher tendency to non-pay. And so it was a -- maybe it's just a blip, but there's two linings to that. One is that, for the first time, we saw a small amount of churn related to that. And the flip side is those customers tend to be very mobile, if you will. And I think given the experience of that product even more so are used for the return of them coming back to a proper broadband product with or without convergence. So anyway, that's just food for thought around that. I hope that answers the question. Go ahead. Maybe we'll ham and egg this between Tom and myself. But I want to go into talking about what we have headroom, and we have the ability to still create packages that create value for consumers. Our philosophy has always been to give the customers what they want. And typically, they want more programming and try to do that the best price we can. And so -- also based on their capacity of their wallet. And so having some of these packages actually allows us to sell more video product, which is to the benefit of the programmers. And that's -- you can see it in the results that we have still losses, but it's a lot lower than losses than other people in the marketplace. And that's a result of our ability to drive video based on what the consumer wants and what they can pay, and sometimes those are in conflict. So I think the -- that model has worked. It will continue to work. But I also think it already for -- as we look to the video space in the future, programmers need to see what we're doing and say, given where we are and given what they're doing themselves with direct-to-consumer and OTC effectively unbundling themselves. But if we had that package flexibility further than we do today, I think we could actually solve some of the problem that exists in the video space and grow for the benefit of programmers, but it's difficult for them to get their heads around that. I think Xumo could help. That's the design. Xumo could help a lot with that. If you take the very best of the Comcast platform, including the voice remote and pair that up in our footprint with Spectrum TV app and live video with all the different packages that we have that can be tailored to consumers appetite as well as their budget and combined with what they're probably already paying through SVOD, DTC, et cetera, in a single platform that allows them to consumed the video product in a single place with unified search, discovery, voice remote, both live as well as all the other content they have. I think that's pretty powerful. And to the extent that we're able to continue to change the requirements that Tom talked about in our programming agreements, I think we can sell more. I don't have it in front of me that split on the 5.3 million, but the vast, vast majority, we're in the connectivity business, and so we're selling mobile service. And to the extent that a customer wants additional devices, of course, we have that and we make it available. But our view here is driving Internet both acquisition as well as Internet churn and to drive profitability, but having an overall higher ARPU and you get that through selling the mobile service combined with the broadband service. Maybe you start with programming and jump... In terms of position with programmers, Tom mentioned the margin issue that exists inside of video. And we've talked about the availability of that content really almost anywhere, in some cases, in many cases, for free because of piracy. We've been a long proponent Tom has been around the problems related to that. So I guess it's fair to say I don't know about harder line. It's just more indifferent about carriage of certain content at a higher increasing price when it's available all across the market at cheaper rates or even for free. And so that's not a harder line, that's just a reality of where we're at.  The two biggest issues inside of the content category continued to be retrans, which is over-the-air content, which we're forced to pass on as a significant cost to our customers. And the development of sports and the other channels are important and put into what I was just describing, but those are the two biggest drivers of cost increases to consumer. Yes. The 2023 broadband net adds, I said our goal is to have higher broadband net adds this year, and I think we will. The biggest variable that's out there is what's taking place in terms of market transaction volume, and that's the only one that gives me angst because it's the one you can't control. But we have a lot of things going in our favour, the -- starting with a lot of these initiatives that I've talked about. So clearly, with a bigger base of rural passings behind us and constructed increasing during the course of the year, I think the early -- small but early success of Spectrum One in driving Internet is only going to grow as that product takes hold. And I think the investments that we've made in our personnel, not to get too much into the weeds, but that labor cost increase that Jessica talked about, there are some pretty big actions that we took that were targeted. They were not peanut butter wage increases. They were targeted to drive an ROI, which means having longer-tenured employees who result in the sales force having better yields, selling better. And in the service infrastructure by having a longer tenure, they tend to do a better and faster job in addressing customer issues and avoid repeats, which not only reduces transactions, but reduces customer churn over time. And those benefits, because of where the labor market was for everybody last year, in order to get tenured investors the passage of time, but we've seen the lowest attrition rates at the back end of Q4 that I've seen in a very, very long time, if ever, in our service and sales functions. And I think that's going to -- that's a function of both the market as well as the investments that we've made. But ultimately, those investments collectively tie into both gross adds as well as to lower churn. And I'll go back to where I started, which is the biggest driver for us and the biggest uncertainty is market volume. But all else equal, that's our goal is to increase net adds this year. You mentioned pricing action and maybe there was some confusion there, but I'll start with what we've done. We -- our philosophy hasn't changed. We're focused on trying to provide competitive products at the best price in the market and best packaging so that we can grow faster. But given what's happened in the video space, we continue to pass through rate increases for the programming increases that we've seen. And if you look back to the middle of last year, you can see it pretty dramatic, given where the economy was and if you're on people's mind, we did a pass-through in the middle of the year. You saw a big downgrade in video and voice. We've done some additional pass-through as well as a small increase on Internet lower than our competitors to maintain our competitiveness. And we did that for Internet-only inside of Q4, and we wanted to wait until you could combine that from a service experience, not to have the bill change twice for customers. So bundled Internet customers is just taking place at the beginning of -- bundled video with Internet customers taking place at the beginning of this year. The reaction there has been pretty muted. It's very low call volume, and given where the rest of the market has been and what we're doing is still maintaining our competitiveness. I am not seeing a big uptick in churns related to the price actions that we pass through. Just in terms of how we look at it, Ben. If you go back to the presentation that we used in December, I threw up an unnamed market with a footprint overlap. So you could take a look at how our strategy evolves between, I think, the colors were gray, gold and blue. Between our existing footprint, RDOF and the way that state grants and now BEAD and other grants we'll be doing. And so we can make the gross cost of our build lower as a result of the strategy in terms of how we approach the market and how we put these together. And so we can have a lower gross cost and therefore lower net cost than our competitors because of the existing footprint that we have, the existing or footprint that we're building. And I think that makes us not only a better economic participant, but a better and more reliable, trustworthy builder for the states in the build because we're the largest rural builder today. We've been successful at it. We're moving at a fast pace. We can get broadband to their constituents at a faster pace at a competitive price with great products, Internet and mobile, and most of these bidders aren't going to have mobile and they're not going to have a converged product, and that's something that we can bring to these communities. I think I'll let Jessica comment. It's still dramatically -- well, it's still much lower than it was pre-pandemic, and the churn is low. Bad debt has been slowly building back up. It's nowhere near back to where it was, but it has an impact on a year-over-year basis. In January, we typically don't talk to intra-quarter, we don't like to. But we're starting to see, and that may be the bridge between what some of our peers and competitors are saying. It's not dramatic, but we have seen a step up both in non-pay as well as bad debt. And I think that just reflects the overall economy. In some sense, you look at that and the upfront impact of that is negative. You don't like it. On the other hand, it's one of the indicators that the market is starting to normalize in terms of transaction volumes, you have a delay from when the bad news comes in and when the selling opportunity arises. So it's a double-edged sword. Thank you, everyone."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Before getting started, I want to remind you that we will be making a couple of changes to our reporting beginning next quarter. First, as we noted in our investor meeting in December, we'll include mobile service revenue in residential and SMB revenue as appropriate. We will no longer report mobile expenses separately, and both of these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and our offer structure. Second, we will provide additional line extension capital and rural disclosures. And finally, I want to note that while our fourth quarter results contain some modest impacts from Hurricane Ian, the overall impact of the hurricane on our financials and customer numbers was very small and doesn't warrant separate disclosure. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 105,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter and added 344,000 over the last 12 months. Video customers declined by 144,000 in the fourth quarter. Wireline voice declined by 233,000 and we added a record 615,000 mobile lines. For the full year, we added 1.7 million mobile lines. Although our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the fourth quarter, activity levels remain low. During the quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the fourth quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. Total churn, voluntary churn and non-plate churn were all lower year-over-year, and we're at all-time lows for the fourth quarter. Move return remains well below pre-pandemic levels, which also reduces our selling opportunity. Gross additions remain down across the footprint by similar amounts in overbuild and non-overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. In terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless, instead of coming to us. But given the issues with fixed wireless, product reliability and scalability, we expect those customers to find their way to us over the long term. In addition, we've seen a slightly higher pace of fiber overbuild recently. And I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects. Despite these challenges with lower market activity, our Spectrum One product is working. We remain in the early stages of offering converged packages of products and refinement to our approach continues, but we're very pleased with the results. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year, with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Also keep in mind that our residential revenue and ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue, although that will change next quarter when we make the reporting adjustments I discussed a moment ago. In addition, we're allocating a portion of Spectrum One-related customer revenue from Internet to mobile revenue under GAAP. As Slide 6 shows, total residential revenue grew by 0.4% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2.4% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9.1%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter advertising revenue grew by 25% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was down by 3%, with lower national and local advertising revenue, driven by the softening ad market, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $876 million, with $401 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue grew by 4.9% year-over-year, mostly driven by higher rural construction initiatives subsidies, partly offset by lower processing fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. In total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 3.5% year-over-year and up 4.5% for the full year 2022. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q4, total operating expenses grew by $359 million or 4.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.3% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers year-over-year, and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2023, we expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 5.3%, primarily driven by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower video CPE sold to customers. Cost to service customers increased by 5.8% year-over-year, driven by higher labor costs, higher fuel and freight costs and higher bad debt, partly offset by productivity improvements. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 4.9%. And while bad debt was higher year-over-year, it remained below pre-COVID level. As we noted in our December investor meeting, we're making very targeted adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits and career paths inside of our operations teams in order to build an even higher skilled and more tenured workforce, which drove the higher labor costs. These adjustments will add some pressure year-over-year to cost to service customers expense growth in the first half of this year. But that year-over-year growth should moderate in the second half of 2023. And we continue to expect additional efficiencies in cost to service customers over time as a result of the continued digitization of service, productivity improvements and our network evolution investment.  Marketing expense grew by 6.9% year-over-year, primarily due to the higher staffing levels I mentioned and wages, which included targeted adjustments in our sales channels. Mobile expenses totaled $982 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 6.6%, primarily driven by higher labor costs and higher advertising sales expense related to higher political revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.9% year-over-year in the quarter and 4.8% for the full year 2022. Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter compared to $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year, with higher income tax and interest expense more than offsetting higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year 2022. Our total CapEx for the year reflects the timing of more accelerated equipment inventory receipts in December than expected. Fourth quarter capital spending of $2.9 billion rose above last year's fourth quarter spend of $2.1 billion, primarily driven by higher line extension spend driven by our rural construction initiative. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, increased from $1.6 billion in last year's fourth quarter to $2 billion this quarter, driven by investment in network evolution, higher customer premise equipment spend on advanced WiFi equipment and timing of spend. For the full year 2023, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. So excluding line extensions, we expect a small increase year-over-year in capital spend driven by the acceleration of network evolution spending and partly offset by declines in other areas. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 level and continue to decline thereafter. Turning to line extensions. In 2023, we expect line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations, assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending. We also expect most BEAD money to begin to be appropriated in the 2024 timeframe with four-year build timelines from grants. At that time, we expect that our RDOF spend will begin to ramp down. We expect the BEAD program to present a unique and attractive opportunity for us to expand our network with subsidies, generating significant returns that solidly exceed our cost of capital. For our additional subsidized passings, we expect our net rural construction cost per passing to be closer to the roughly $3,000 per passing that we've incurred in our recent subsidized state and local builds than to our RDOF per passing costs. Our six-month penetration of passings in our newly built rural areas continues to be around 40%, and we expect penetrations in these areas to continue to grow. If you use the cost per passing that I mentioned a moment ago, a high broadband penetration assumption, which we think is reasonable, our current ARPU, excluding mobile, a high incremental margin based on low incremental overhead costs and a reasonable terminal multiple or perpetuity growth rate, you can clearly see the very attractive IRRs associated with our rural builds. Turning to Slide 10. We generated $1.1 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher capital expenditures, mostly the result of our rural construction initiatives and by higher cash tax payments. For the full year, we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow versus $8.7 billion in 2021. However, excluding cash taxes and our rural construction initiative, our full year free cash flow grew by 4%. We finished the quarter with $97.4 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5 billion. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1.3 billion at an average price of $344 per share. For the full year, we repurchased 23.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling approximately $11.7 billion. We have a proven operating balance sheet and capital allocation model that drives customer and financial growth and shareholder value. We've always prioritized investments that generate long-term growth, and those investments ultimately protect and extend our return of capital to shareholders. We continue to generate significant free cash flow and intend to both invest for long-term growth and simultaneously returned excess capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yes. So the $4 billion, Vijay, I do think that it's kind of a budgeting exercise, but it's our expectation, and it's on the higher end of our expectations. But it all matters how much we win and subsidized builds. And so it really is a matter of sort of what's available and what makes sense from an ROI perspective for us to spend and to try to get additional passings and generate additional returns. But I think the $4 billion is where we think that we will be based on our expectation of what will happen right now. So that's probably the way to think about that. On the cash tax, our cash tax liability is always dependent on a number of different variables. We're a full cash taxpayer now. We've previously given guidance on taxes. If you look back, I think, at what we said in Q4 of 2021, and there's more CapEx in the plan now, which generally should reduce that liability. But because you don't have 100% deductibility, you don't get 100% credit for that anymore. As a result, I would look back at that guidance. And we might be slightly above the percentages that we gave there, maybe 1% or 2% higher, but you can generally sort of look back to that to think about how to estimate cash tax. So Craig, on the margins question, I would tell you, first off, we wouldn't be willing to do the Spectrum One offer if we didn't have some space in margin. And so our margins in that business, if you exclude the subscriber acquisition costs, continue to be quite good. And they're getting better over time because we continue to drive down some of those business expenses on a per customer basis, things like the operating cost, what does it take to run billing and customer care. And actually, the reason that we're pushing those into our broader reporting is that we continue to integrate the business into our broader business. And so a lot of that activity we're dealing with a customer as one customer. And when you have a sales call, you're selling mobile and cable on the same call. When you have somebody call in with a question, you have agents who we'll be capable of dealing with both things. But I think the overall trajectory, we make margin on the customers today. We have offers in the mix that we're using to drive both mobile and broadband activity, but they work well for that. And I think we should think about them as being related to both that mobile and broadband activity. But we expect the margins to continue to grow. I think we gave some numbers in the presentation in December, and you can kind of see the trajectory that we're on there. I think that margin expansion continues when you think about the broader product. So on your other two questions, in cost to serve, quarter-over-quarter growth in Q4 was 5.8%. I would expect Q1 to look more like -- to look a bit like that. And then for it to sort of the year-over-year growth to decrease across the year until you're more in line with the sort of growth trajectory that we've seen before, which is really largely flat. For programming per sub cost, the reason that they remain flat year-over-year that, that's our expectation, really has to do with customer mix and whether customers are taking sort of packages that have larger channel sets or more premiums or whether they continue to be priced out of those packages and come into some skinnier packages where the programming cost per sub is less. So it's a mix issue, certainly not an issue that programmers are no longer raising rates. Yes. To clarify, on the guidance, it's programming cost per sub that is flat year-over-year. And the mix shift is not that that significantly different from what we have seen previously. The base is smaller. And so as the base -- the mix of incoming customers does differ from the base, but the mix shift isn't -- it's not that substantially different. On the EBITDA side, as you said, we don't give EBITDA guidance, but certainly, we do expect growth in 2023. I think I drive it out of a few things. We have continued to have customer growth. I think we've talked about on the rate side. We have taken some small rate actions recently. And then we continue to believe that we have -- we continue to expect rates to be good across those customers. So driving revenue growth. I would remind you that we lapped last year's rate increases in April. So to your comment around timing, the second quarter is probably the space in which that's most challenged. But -- and then as Chris said, we've made these investments in tenure. We expect to gain better efficiencies both out of the tenure initiative, out of the continued digitization of the process that we have. We continue to improve in our operational efficiency, which drives sort of relative costs out of the business. And so I think we're pretty confident in generating that EBITDA growth year-over-year. Yes. So I'm going to start at the bottom of the list, Ben. We expect to build around 300,000 subsidized rural passings in 2023, which are mostly RDOF and they're incremental to the normal business as usual pace of build. What I would do with those is we've given you information on how much penetration we get of those passings, the 40% at six months. We continue to grow after we hit that 40% at six months, but you can time them in that way. Our pace coming into the end of the year within the 15,000 to 20,000 passings per month range, and I would expect -- we're starting the year at that pace and we're going to end at a faster pace to get to that total of 300,000 number. The $3,000 per passing, so just to be clear, I think what I said was that we would be closer to the $3,000 that we've been in the more recent subsidized builds than to our RDOF amount. So we're totally prescriptive around $3,000 exactly. But that is a net number. Our expectation on state subsidized and on the BEAD build is that those programs are likely to be structured in a way where the expenses count -- where the subsidies are accounted for as a capital offset and not as revenue. So we're going at it with net numbers. Gross build costs, I think, are a lot harder. And so we understand quite a bit now about what we need to -- about what we want in terms of driving economics and also sort of had some experience in bidding these passings and are seeing what's happening in the marketplace. But what you win impacts a lot about what those gross build costs are and they could be in a pretty wide range. So I don't have a number on that side. Yes. The other piece I would remind you we've talked about before, we're a big participant in ACP and a big proponent of that program. I think for our customers that are more prone to non-pay. We've endeavored to make sure that they recognize that, that program is available to them and to be part of the solution they're making Internet affordable for them.  It has two impacts. One is that those customers don't churn as much as before. The other impact, though, is that on some of those customers that convert into the ACP program. We might be carrying a balance related to those customers that then ends up sort of flushing through in our bad debt computation. So while bad debt is higher on a numerical value basis, it's not necessarily connecting into a non-pay churn where we've converted the customer to being an ACP customer. Thank you."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instruction for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter's third quarter 2022 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge : Thank you, Stefan. As I look at our current advanced offerings, our future product plans and the underpenetration of our network, we're well positioned to grow our business at very attractive rates for many years to come. During the quarter, we added 75,000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains very low due to current consumer behavior. And while the lower year-over-year connect activity improved, connects remain challenged due to the low activity environment. We continue to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 396,000, our best quarter yet. Over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50% and as of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 4.7 million total mobile lines. Our opportunity in mobile is very large, and we're still at the beginning of developing that business. Today, we only captured 28% of the combined household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So we remain significantly underpenetrated versus the opportunity in front of us. And we're delivering the fastest Internet and the fastest Wi-Fi speeds in the nation and the fastest mobile speeds when combined with Wi-Fi, all the while serving customers -- saving customers, I should say, thousands of dollars a year. Today, we have close to 500 million devices connected to our network, the vast majority of which are connected to us wirelessly. Ultimately, I expect that virtually all devices connected to our network will connect wirelessly. To continue to improve our services, we also remain focused on evolving our network to offer the fastest speeds in the most cost and time-efficient manner. Data usage continues to grow at a fast pace. Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 700 gigabytes per month. Nearly 25% of those customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. The downstream traffic still dominates usage at a ratio of 14:1 versus upstream traffic. In the near-term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity bi-directionally and allow us to allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Our network evolution path also includes DOCSIS 4.0, so we can maintain a state-of-the-art network that delivers the most compelling converged connectivity services in a capital and time-efficient manner and turn offer those advanced services to consumers at highly attractive prices. As you may know, I plan to step down as CEO on December 1st that time, Chris Winfrey will become our new CEO, and I will become Executive Chairman. It's been personally fulfilling to lead Charter over the last 10 years. We've grown our company through innovation and strategic investments that position Charter to provide the best connectivity products and services available today everywhere we operate. Our products have continually evolved and changed the world during my career from the carriage of broadcast signals when I began to the development of robust video and multi-channel cable networks. And from the early days of broadband, Internet and voice to now offering fully ubiquitous wireless connectivity, we continue to drive new uses for our networks to bring value to consumers and our opportunity to innovate and grow is greater today than ever before. Having worked closely with Chris for more than 10 years, I know that he's the right choice to be our next CEO. He will serve Charter with both vision and skill leading the company to new heights. Chris' leadership and expertise in both operations and finance have been pivotal to Charter's growth and success over the past 10 years. He's repeatedly demonstrated in a strategic insight in key market and industry awareness to drive our organization to perform at the highest levels. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Tom, and thanks for the kind words. I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to continue to help Charter grow and to create shareholder value as the incoming CEO. It has also been a privilege for all of us here at Charter to work for and learn from Tom over the past 10 years. His leadership is the reason Charter exists as it does today, and he's mentored all of us here to keep reinventing cable and we're fortunate that he'll continue to do the same as our Executive Chairman. So Tom covered the quarterly headlines, so I thought I'd give some additional market color. While our Internet net additions improved from last quarter, they remained below last year. The largest driver by far is that activity level remains low. Total churn and voluntary churn were slightly lower year-over-year and were at all-time lows for third quarter. Non-pay and move churn remains well-below pre-pandemic levels. Those are market issues that also reduce our selling opportunities. While we've seen some improving trends, gross additions also remain down across the footprint by similar amounts in both overbuild and non-overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. In terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless instead of coming to us. Given the issues with fixed wireless product reliability and scalability and usage trends, we expect those customers to find their way back to us over the long-term. We've also seen a similar pace of fiber reported telco Internet numbers confirm what we saw, a small mix issue from newly overbuilt footprint, no different from the past. I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects. So we're in a unique moment, the opposite of the one we saw in 2020 and early 2021, in fact. Market transaction volume will eventually pick up, and so will our Internet net adds. In the meantime, we're growing mobile at record rates, even in a low volume environment by saving customers thousands of dollars. That growth is also good for broadband. So we remain well positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband services continue to converge technically and operationally, and our Spectrum 1 offering launched earlier this month exemplifies that. As Tom mentioned, we have a path to drive significantly higher speeds, at a much faster pace and at much lower cost than our competitors. And we can sustain good revenue growth, lower cost of service per customer relationship for many years. I've been in the cable industry for almost 25 years and at Charter for over 10 years. And I've played a key role in developing our operating strategy. So our recipe for creating shareholder value through better products, pricing and packaging and service, coupled with a levered equity return strategy will remain intact. At the same time, I do think, the CEO transition will be a good opportunity for us, both in this market and with the transition taking place to update investors on what I expect over the next few years, including details of our network evolution plan, convergence capabilities, service experience for customers and our rural expansion and build-out plans. That's a lot to cover, so I look forward to a virtual event with the investment community that we'll schedule for a date, following the CEO transition in December. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to mention that today's results do not include any impact related to Hurricane Ian, which hit the East Coast in late September. Initially, approximately 1 million of our customers lost service, primarily because of power outages, but our crews worked hard to repair our network and reconnect customers, and they did a great job. Broadly speaking, our plant fared well despite the storm and service was destroyed to nearly to all impacted customers in relatively short period of time. And while we expect our fourth quarter results to contain some bill credits, some incremental CapEx related to plant replacement and some incremental operating expense related to store cleanup and call center labor, we expect the overall impact of Hurricane Ian on our financials and customer numbers will be very small. Let's turn to customer results on slide five. Including residential and SMB, we added 75,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. Video customers declined by $204,000 in the third quarter, following a programming pass-through increase in the second quarter. Wireline voice declined by 271,000, and we added a record 396,000 mobile lines despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service. Looking forward, we expect our new Spectrum 1 offer to drive accelerating mobile line growth. Moving to financial results, starting on slide six. Over the last year, residential customers grew by $123,000 or 0.4% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, higher expanded basic video losses in the last several quarters and accelerated growth of lower-priced video packages within our base. Our year-over-year residential revenue per customer relationship growth was lower this quarter than last, given the timing of rate adjustments in this year versus last and the mix factors I just mentioned. Also, keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 0.7% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.9% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.6% year-over-year or by 5.2% year-over-year when excluding some one-time fees from the prior period, which were a benefit last year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9% and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year. Third quarter advertising revenue grew by 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was flat year-over-year with lower national and local advertising revenue, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $750 million with $303 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 2.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers mostly offset by rural construction initiatives subsidies. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 3.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q3, total operating expenses grew by $278 million or 3.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2022, we now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low single-digit percentage range. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined 7.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers. For the full year 2022, we now expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. Cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 3%, primarily due to higher fuel and freight costs, partly offset by productivity improvements. And while bad debt and non-pay churn were higher year-over-year, both remain well below pre-COVID levels. We now expect cost to service customers expense growth for the second half of 2022 to be more consistent with growth in the first half of 2022. Marketing expenses grew by 9.3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher staffing levels and wages, as Charter focuses on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we now expect marketing expense to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. Mobile expenses totaled $846 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 4.4%, primarily driven by higher labor costs, higher advertising sales expense related to political revenue and higher computer and software expense, partly offset by lower corporate costs this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, essentially flat with last year, with higher adjusted EBITDA offset by higher interest expense. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $1.9 billion. Most of that increase was driven by $525 million of spend on our rural construction initiative in the quarter, and the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions. In rural, we've accelerated our walkout and design nationally to allow for additional time for the process of securing full access. In addition, our access to inventory is improving, so we're carrying a more appropriate amount of inventory to support the belt. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year on the rural construction initiative. We spent $96 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back office systems. Core cable CapEx, which excludes our rural and mobile CapEx, increased from $1.7 billion last year to $1.8 billion this quarter, driven by modestly higher CPE and scalable infrastructure spending. We continue to expect core cable capital expenditures to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion for the full year 2022. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx, mostly driven by our rural construction initiative. Excluding cash taxes, our rural construction initiative and litigation settlements, free cash flow grew by 5% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $96.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.8 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.48 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $445 per share. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson : Thanks so much. I think perhaps two questions. Tom, what a career and Chris, congratulations. I wanted to ask about Spectrum One first. And Tom reminds me of when you launched the triple play. The 2005 back when FiOS U-verse were launching, and it looked like a really intriguing price and value for customers, but also kind of lower than perhaps prior promotions. So I'm just hoping that you and Chris can walk through the strategy behind the Spectrum One promotion and the financial impact relative to your prior promotional strategies. And then separately, Chris, I know it's early and you're indicating that you're going to update us in December, like how broadly are you considering strategy shifts. Obviously, investors are a combination of nervous and excited about changes that might take place. I mean is there a scope to rapidly accelerate capital spending or different pricing strategies? How wide is the net here in terms of what you're considering? Is this revolution or evolution? Thank you.\nTom Rutledge : Thanks, Doug. Yes, your memory is good. And I'll turn the answer over to Chris. But when triple-play was first announced, there was a lot of skepticism, and some people thought it was foolish, but it turned out to be quite successful.\nChris Winfrey: So I think there's -- similarly, maybe a little confusion out there about what Spectrum One is. And really, it's our first attempt and it may evolve over time. But Spectrum One packages seamless connectivity with our products, and they all work better together. It's offered at a first year promotional price. And as a result, our pricing of the underlying products, whether that's Internet, advanced WiFi and mobile, it has not changed. Even after that promotional period, Spectrum One creates values for customers in a way that our competitors really can't replicate. It's pretty similar to what was the design of Tom's original triple-play. And we also attach additional products or mobile lines to that promotional sell-in. So contrary to what I think is maybe a fear. We have not lowered our pricing in the marketplace, nor do we believe that we need to. Doug, on strategy shift, I mean, in the prepared remarks, I wanted to be clear, because I understand that's out there as well. I've been a player in developing our operating strategy here with Tom and John Bickham and others over the past decade. And just because somebody gives you a new title doesn't mean that your view on fundamentally how to create shareholder value changes overnight. So I'm pretty committed to all things that we're doing today in terms of our strategy around products, pricing, package, service. As I mentioned, our capital structure, obviously had a little bit of a hand in that as well in our balance sheet and M&A strategy. So I don't expect any seismic shifts. I've always thought that if we were going to do something anyway in terms of capital, might as well go get after it, so you can grow faster. And so, if there's opportunities to accelerate what we're already doing, we'll do that. But I don't think people should expect any fundamental changes and views on how we operate the business or how we create value for shareholders.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Doug. Katie, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you and congrats, Tom. I'm sure we'll miss you more than you'll miss us, but please stay in touch. Yes, I guess sticking with the wireless scheme and the network, Chris, last quarter, you were willing to highlight to us that, maybe, we on the sell side, have got the wireless economics wrong. Obviously, you've got the Spectrum One plan in the market, which seems to be doing what you hoped it would, which is to drive faster growth. I'm sure we'll see more of that in Q4. The losses in wireless, and I know product P&Ls are of limited use to some extent, but it looks like they'll be pretty flattish year-on-year this year. I'm just wondering, is there a way you can sort of take us into the cost structure on the wireless side, speak to the network offload opportunities? And is there any way to help us think about, as you continue down this convergence path, is there a time line towards EBITDA starting to inflect and really benefit from the wireless revenue scale you're building? Because it sounds like -- looks like we're not going to see that at least in the near term. And then, I'm just wondering, what are the returns you're seeing on the high split activity so far? And you mentioned DOCSIS 4.0. Tom did in his prepared remarks. Do you have a sort of a time line you want to sort of lay out for us or how you think about the benefits of high split and DOCSIS 4.0 over the course of the next few years to the business?\nChris Winfrey: So, two quick things, and then I'm going to pass it over to Jessica. On Spectrum One, we didn't launch that until October. So it had no impact on our Q3 results. And on your question regarding high split, we're going to go into lots of detail in December. So, I'm going to try to be quiet today around all that. There's nothing shocking. I think Tom and others may elaborate on the benefits of high spot, but we'll give a more detailed plan in December. The question is on the mobile. I'm going to hand that over to Jessica around the financials on mobile and she can go through that.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So, mobile EBITDA losses remained due to a few things. The first one, I'm sure you saw this is our best quarter yet for mobile growth, and we continue to have additional sort of customer acquisition costs because of that, that weigh on mobile EBITDA. Also, we did see both in mobile and in the cable side increases in bad debt in the year-over-year. And so there's some of that that's impacting mobile EBITDA. And we did implement a new system earlier in the year. I think Tom has talked about it. And we're still sort of working through the last of the costs related to having implemented that system. And so there's a little weight there that I think will come down as we settle in a bit more. But the key here is that you should know that gross margin in the mobile product continues to be very good. And as Chris mentioned, Spectrum One, while it offers a promotional price on mobile, we're both selling additional lines in with that promotional offer and at our rack rate, which that rolls to in 12 months, we make very solid margins off of the mobile business. And because of that, we remain will remain profitable in that business absent the growth cost even with the promotional pricing to drive overall customer relationships.\nTom Rutledge: Yes, at a high level, Ben, on spectrum splits, what they essentially do is give you the opportunity to increase down speeds and upstream speeds significantly and to offer products symmetrically at pretty low capital cost. When we did DOCSIS 3.1, you remember, we spent about $9 a point past, not counting CPE, and -- which was $450 million approximately to get the plant ready. This is going to cost a little more than that, but it's still a relatively low-cost capital investment that gives you a significant increase in capacity. And it leaves you in a pathway where you can continue to invest with additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0 to even further enhance the capability of the network at a pretty capital-efficient way that gives you massive capacity and moves us to the 10G world we've been talking about over time. And as a general concept, it takes away additional operating costs as well and additional capital cost when you make these investments because the augmentation in the network that you have to do for growth, I talked in my prepared remarks about how much capacity people are using that capacity use continues to go up. So, this -- and we have a normal capital budget associated with that growth in capacity. And when you do these spectrum split upgrades, you get that capacity included with that investment. So, you don't have to make the augmentation investment. So, it's a very efficient way of ubiquitously deploying lots of capability across your entire footprint. And I think the cable industry, in general, will have that capacity across its entire footprint very relatively quickly.\nJessica Fischer: And I think given what we've seen in the field implementations that have happened so far, our confidence in the capital efficiency of the implementation as well as our ability to do it at speed have both grown versus even, I would say, where we were last quarter or the quarter before. So very good progress and what we've seen both in the field and from the supplier community as to how that upgrade will be able to be executed in.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Ben. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. First, congratulations to you, Tom, and also to you, Chris, on the transition. Two questions, if I could. First, Tom, just a personal question for you. Can you elaborate a little bit on the timing of your decision? What made you decide now was the right time? And then second, with respect to broadband, what are you seeing in terms of broadband costs? You're, obviously, doing a lot at the edges of your network that would, I think, give you good insight into labor costs and the implications of cost of capital, what are you seeing both for you? And would you suspect for fiber overbuilders that are competitors, and does it have any implications for how you think about the RDOF build? Are there any of those markets that as costs have risen are now less attractive and potentially less interesting to continue to pursue.\nTom Rutledge: There's a lot in those in that question. First, with regard to my timing, actually, two years ago, put in my contract that on August 15th of this year, I would have an option in my employment agreement to begin the process of transitioning to Executive Chairman and giving up the CEO role. I chose that date two years ago, because it was the 50th anniversary of my beginning in cable as a technician working my way through college in 1972. So I have personal meaning to me, and I thought it was a milestone a couple of years ago that I might want to exercise. And then the other thought I had was at the end of this Executive Chairmanship, I'd be 70 years old, and I thought well, maybe I should think about not working after that age. But on the other hand, I was -- I love this business and I love what the future is for this business, and there's tremendous opportunity. And I want to see it through, but it's going to -- it's just such a good business and it's going to go on so long that it's time to pass at the time. So that's how I came to the decision. To your broadband cost questions, yeah, there are cost issues and we've had to deal with those costs and they're in our numbers. In this quarter, you can see that there's some inflationary pressure out there, and there have been labor force dislocations as a result of COVID and the economic policies that the country employed to deal with it. And they're significant, but we've -- our strategy from a pricing and packaging perspective is to be the value provider and to make these products work together at lower prices and create good value for consumers and to use our ability to drive market share as the primary driver of our revenue, but that said, we have been passing through video price increases, and we've passed through recently a broadband price increase and it was a result of the inflationary pressures that we've seen. At the same time, it doesn't negate the way our primary revenue opportunity is developing, which is to create more customers faster and to create those customers with more products associated with each connection so that our ARPU and the revenue go up together. And that's the primary driver of our revenue strategy. Our cost strategy though is real, and we are working in RDOF to develop we have had higher costs than we anticipated, but we've also had more success than we anticipated in terms of both penetration and the number of passings that we can develop off of the RDOF projects that we've built. So net-net, our cost is what we thought it would be on a per passing basis. But it does create pressure and difficulty for people to attract labor and to get things done. And so we're having issues ourselves with supply chain and the development of a workforce and how we do the work and what order we do work is being impacted by the labor market and the supply market. So I do think the cost of money and the cost of labor and the cost of everything will affect our competitors' ability to build as well.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. The advantage that we have there against many of them is scale. So certainly, when it comes to being able to acquire and then to move supply around the areas where we're ready and most able to build. I think that we have -- we continue to have a very good ability to do that. And really on the cost of capital side, the advantage that we have is a large amount of free cash flow that we're able to deploy really what's a relatively small portion of to execute on these builds. So we're not as beholden to borrowing on a regular basis to fund our builds as some others in the market are. So I think we continue to be well positioned. The rural builds are actually performing at least as well or actually better than we expected. And from a financial perspective, I'm still confident in where we are on the returns that we had said that we would have against those belts.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you. And again, congratulations to you and to Chris, Tom, for the transition.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. Katie, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. A couple of follow-ups, if I can. Chris, looking forward to your event in December, I know you addressed somewhat a couple of things a minute ago, but I noticed you didn't mention updates on core network capital intensity or leverage targets as part of this transition, which are things that we hear people asking about in the market, any changes to consider here that you can give us a little preview on? And then second, I know it's early, but Jessica, can you follow up on that, those rural initiatives and the contribution there to broadband subs. How should we think about capital spending for RDOF and other rural initiatives next year? Thank you. \nChris Winfrey: I'll take the first one. I think Jessica mentioned in her prepared remarks, our view on core capital intensity in terms of outlook and she wouldn't have said that if we didn't collectively believe that was the case now and going forward. She mentioned excluding rural and that there may be some lumpiness as it relates to the timing of exactly how you get high split in supply chain and inventory and all that. But the core capital intensity continues to decline.  The leverage target, I've heard that rumor out in the marketplace. I find it a little bit funny because I've been at 4.5x since Switzerland since Germany since Charter, 4.5x and had a levered equity strategy for a really long time, probably over 20 years, and I helped put that together here at Charter and we have good growth. And the interest rates aren't all that different. In fact, it probably less for us as Charter today than when I got here at Charter. So, our views on how to create value through the operating strategy and how to pair that with the balance sheet and M&A strategy and a levered equity strategy, that hasn't changed.  And I mentioned the same thing in the prepared remarks is while we're on the topic, I know one of the other topics out there and I think Doug was going, there's -- do I believe that we need to do a fiber overbuild for our entire network. No, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to have operate two networks, which is what a lot of the overbuilders have had to do when they got into it. We have a really good path forward. It doesn't mean that we don't do fiber, we do fiber on the increment. There may be portions of the network longer term that we decide it's economical to do that. But for the most part and in fact, in its entirety the path that Tom laid out is the path that we're on. And we're not \u2013 I don't see any reason why want to go to a full fiber for build of perfectly otherwise good network that can be upgraded and dramatically lower cost and have the same capabilities.\nJessica Fischer: On the rural side, I guess on your first question, the contribution to broadband subs. Certainly, we are seeing broadband subs coming in off of the rural build that we're executing already. I think I've said that we will start providing some more detailed information about femoral build and we weren't quite to do that this quarter. But I would expect coming into year-end that will provide some better information. It's not the entire growth in broadband.  So the growth that you see, the 75,000 additions reflects growth off of our legacy footprint as well as some \u2013 a smaller amount of incremental growth off of the broadband subs. But we are doing very well in those markets that we build out. As far as thinking about how you should think about rural for next year, I don't want to front run giving guidance on that piece just yet.  I would tell you that I think what we did in this year to try to accelerate, walk out and design is certainly in an effort to be able to build the rural builds at a good pace, which I think is both consistent with what strategically we'd like to do because having the passings and service sooner than later is good for the business.  And from a regulatory perspective, we are certainly doing everything that we can to meet expectations on that side as well and in placing the build in service. But I don't, on that basis sort of have a number to give you for next year. I'd just tell you that I would expect our pace to continue to be strong because we're trying to build what we need to build as quickly as we're able to do so.\nPhilip Cusick : Thank you. And congratulations again, Tom and Chris, that's well deserved. \nTom Rutledge : Thank you, Phil.\nStefan Anninger : Thanks, Phil. Katie, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chaplin : Thanks. Tom, to add my congratulations to the rest. It's been an incredible run. I only wish the stock was where it was a year ago as you were heading out to the door. Maybe it will beat by December, holding fund congratulations to you as well, Chris. I'm wondering if you can give us -- so you mentioned that you haven't changed prices on any of your packages or plans and you don't really see the spectrum one-off with a price cut. I'm wondering if you can comment on the pricing environment more broadly around you from your competitors and how you think the introduction of fixed wireless broadband into the market may be impacting industry pricing more broadly? And then, Tom, you sort of reiterated what Charter's strategy has been clearly for years and years, which is to drive growth with volumes and to be very measured on price. And it\u2019s been clear how that's been sort of a hallmark of creating long-term value for Charter for a long time. Help us think about though the pace at which EBITDA would grow in an environment where volumes are just going to be potentially lower for a while if you -- and you're continuing to take a measured approach to pricing? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey : I'll jump in first. We haven't changed sorry, I just wanted to correct that I said we haven't lowered our pricing. Tom mentioned that we have passed through some of the inflationary cost increases, and that includes broadband should be indicative in terms of how you're thinking about that. And then on the fixed lines, I'm just throwing in a few pieces here and let others cover the rest. The fixed wireless access, the pricing really is designed for a full suite bundle of multiple mobile lines, and in some cases, high-priced mobile lines combined with the access. So I think the right comparison is if you take a look at our existing pricing in September with both broadband and mobile lines, because that's a comparable comparison. We're now with Spectrum One and compare that to the combined fixed wireless access offering. I think that's the best way to take a look at it. When you do that, you'll see that we're dramatically not only lower in terms of price and higher in terms of value, but the quality of the product is not really comparable. But I think that's the right way to think about those.\nTom Rutledge : Yes. And I guess I would just add that that opportunity for our ability to continue to grow against the market share is significant. I said in my prepared remarks that we're 28% penetrated in terms of dollar takeout of consumer spend for mobile and for broadband combined. And so we have this big physical infrastructure where every customer we connect to it requires no real significant capital. And the opportunity for us to drive growth using that network with superior products at attractive prices is huge and the dollar value of what's in front of us is huge. And so that's the big opportunity in our structure. And it really hasn't changed. The fact that, we have mobility associated with our broadband products now and a combined product really means that you have very high-priced mobile products with very small usage on a bandwidth basis, and we can add those into our product mix very attractively for consumers. And when we look at what consumers are spending, we can save those consumers a lot of money. So that's the basic concept. And it hasn't changed. And what has changed is the technologies we're using and the product sets and how they're combined, but the basic notion of there's a huge marketplace with a lot of spend in it, and we're not getting much of it, and we'd like to get more, and we will.\nJessica Fischer: And I guess, in terms of how that then translates into EBITDA trajectory, Jonathan, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone that based on the lower broadband customer growth that we've had over the last year, really coming out of the really accelerated growth in those customers and we pull forward during COVID will mean that we had kind of higher revenue growth followed by what's likely to be somewhat lower revenue growth versus that COVID time period. But I think based on what Tom talked about that then as we sort of execute on the converge connectivity plan and as we see it return to normalcy in the market, we certainly expect that in the medium to long-term, that that will pick up back-up and so that you will have that increasing revenue growth again. Similarly on the expense side, we certainly have seen some impact, and I think we called out some of the impact of inflation in the financials in Q3. But we think that, that sort of once again sort of, is it temporary crunch on growth that is consistent with what people had what we think that people expect. But it will be followed by a return to more normal levels. And so ultimately, in the medium and long term, I think that the trajectory of EBITDA growth is back closer to pre-pandemic levels. But I acknowledge that, I think that, there could be a little bit of slowness in that growth in the short term.\nJonathan Chaplin: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Jessica. I appreciate that.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. We will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. My congratulations to you both. I had just a couple of questions. One, you've talked about a broadband rate increase. I mean we haven't seen in the market. Any details on what the magnitude of that is? And obviously, ARPU for broadband seems to be a big focus for all of us, given sort of flattish unit growth. So any sense on what that could drive broadband ARPU in 2023? And then just for housekeeping, was there any ACV impact on the broadband net adds for the quarter? Thanks so much.\nJessica Fischer: So I'll take the last one of those first. There was some impact of the EBB to ACP conversion on broadband in the quarter. It was much smaller than it was last quarter, and we expect it to be much smaller going forward. So I don't think we'll call it out at all separately. And I would call Internet ARPU growth in the year-over-year. Overall ARPU was flat, but Internet ARPU was up 2.2%. If you included mobile and overall ARPU, it would have been up $1.60 versus last year. So we think that there is ARPU growth happening in the market, really largely driven by mix issues and by our ability to penetrate the market further on the mobile side, driving additional, I'd say, real growth of the business beyond just what you can get from a pricing perspective. So we feel like we're doing well there. I don't think that we'll give guidance on what ARPU growth we expect going forward, but that\u2019s what we are seeing now.\nVijay Jayant: Okay. Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: All right. Thanks Vijay. We\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Supino with Wolf Research. Your line is now open.\nPeter Supino: Hi, and thank you. Two questions. One, mobile. Historically, Charter and Comcast have said that mobile is primarily added by existing customers. And I'm wondering if it's fair to assume that Spectrum One represents an intent to invest what you've called the high mobile contribution margin on the incremental sub in customer acquisitions and converged customers, and whether that is the solution for this broadband problem. And separately, I just wondered if you could comment on sequential growth. It looks to me like broadband, commercial and mobile adjusted for a view of the EBB losses grew less than $50 million sequentially. And I'm trying to square this with your leverage. I'm sure it's not your view that that is the future. And so any comments on sequential growth would be helpful. Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: Peter, to the first part of your question, I'd say yes we expect to be able to pull the broadband growth through. It's a complicated sale, obviously, but yes.\nChris Winfrey: You mentioned Spectrum One solution to the broadband growth issue we have right now. And I think it could be additive, but it's not the solution. The problem right now is market activity. And I know that's not the fashionable thing to say right now. But the biggest problem we face is market activity. And when that comes back, I think that's the solution to the broadband growth. And the Spectrum One has the opportunity, as Tom said, to drive incremental Internet growth. As well as still today, the biggest source of mobile growth is by far the upgrades to our existing Internet base, which should benefit that base as well.\nJessica Fischer: On sequential growth, I guess, I would point out a couple of things. One, I highlighted in the prepared remarks, which was that the growth that we saw in Q2 was impacted by pricing adjustments that we had taken for video pass-through. And the way that those overlap year-over-year, you actually had the impact of two in the second quarter versus only one in the third quarter. So that's part of what was happening there. They're also in enterprise, commercial. There was a one-time item that was a benefit in last year that you don't have in this year that pressured those growth rates in the year-over-year or in the sequential quarter. So some of what you're seeing there is just the impact of lumpiness, not overall growth trajectory. On the leverage point, I would say that where we're sitting right now, the free cash flow yield on equity is so high that I think that continuing to do share buybacks presents significant opportunity for the company, just based on where we're sitting on that point. And the overall capital structure, I think, has been an advantage to the company in the long-term. And so I don't see where we are even in what might be a temporarily pressured growth environment as being a reason to move off of where we've been from a leverage standpoint or as your buyback strategy? And so consistent with what I said, we certainly expect to stay at the top of our four to four and a half times leverage ratio.\nPeter Supino: Thank you. Tom, thanks for a great decade at Charter.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Peter. We'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBrett Feldman: Thanks. And I'll just echo my congrats to Tom and to Chris. My first question here is a follow-up for Jessica. You mentioned the merits of continuing to buy back your stock at these levels. Your debt is also trading at significant discounts to par. I'm wondering if that could also be an accretive opportunity to buy back some of your debt out of the market? And then we've seen cord cutting pick up on a year-over-year basis at your business and most other operators' businesses. I'm curious if you could give us some insight as to what's driving it. Meaning, we know that there's been fewer and fewer gross connects over the last several years. I'm wondering if you're actually seeing an uplift in people cutting the cord, meaning they get rid of their pay TV, but remain with you as a customer for broadband? Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: So, on the debt repurchase question, I also have noticed that our debt is trading at a discount in the market. We do modeling consistently as to what we think the best option as between the two is, particularly given our plans to stay at the top end of our leverage range. And so I won't comment on anything in particular that we plan to do. But we do certainly notice it. And we'll continue to do our modeling, and we'll make the next decision based on what appears appropriate given where the market sits at that moment.\nChris Winfrey: Cord cutting, the biggest driver here is the pricing of video. And the fact that we're having to pass through programming rate increases, which still continue to be outsized even relative to inflation means that customers have a difficulty affording it even if it's really something that they'd like to have. And so yes, it predominantly is driving downgrades of video.\nTom Rutledge: But not disconnects of\u2026\nChris Winfrey: And retaining the connectivity.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. And in many cases, we disconnect the video customer downgraded video customer and sell a mobile package at the same time. And they actually end up saving money, obviously, because they have no video or they buy a smaller video package from us in many cases. But they also end up driving ARPU up in the sense that they buy mobile and that mobile is a good value for them. Their overall hospital spend savings -- it is a savings.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Brett. Katie, we'll take our last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks. Two questions. First, if I could revisit the ARPU discussion. As you're looking at that relationship between broadband ARPU and volume performance in the quarter, does this signify that there's just greater price sensitivity to grow the broadband base going forward? And then secondly, if the US goes into recession, how should investors think about the sensitivity in terms of Charter's KPIs and financial performance? And as you're describing the customers are trading down in video, is there a risk that, that accelerates or that customers step down their broadband peers. Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: I'll try to answer that. I've been through a lot of recessions in my career. And I have a hard time remembering them because our business performed so well during them. And the reason is that our products are really attractive even when consumers are under stress. Obviously, there's a certain amount of stress that you can't overcome. And video, I think, will be challenged. But on the other hand, it's a very attractive product if you're unemployed. And it's still, even at the high price that it is a, good value relative to other forms of entertainment. So \u2013 but the reality is that in a recessionary environment when people become more price-sensitive, the value proposition that we offer with our everyday pricing is superior to what they can get elsewhere, which means that we actually become more attractive when people are more conscious of the price they're paying for other products. And so I'm not that worried about a recession from our company's perspective.\nJessica Fischer: And there might be some impacts that you would see in a space like advertising enterprise. But the performance that we could get in mobile, particularly given our pricing there would be good. And even if it had video downgrades on the other side, the margins in mobile are actually better than the margins in the video. So you get some advantage of more customers moving into the mobile side of the business as well.\nTom Rutledge: So we're not hoping for a recession, but...\nJessica Fischer: We'll be fine.\nChris Winfrey: On broadband, it's a staple product, which insulated during that. But unlike many, we have not been pushing speed upgrades for the purpose of just generating rate. It's really been about when a customer wants a higher speed or feels they need a higher speed. That's when it's been offered and it's been offered at an attractive rate. And so the risk of the downgrade of the speed upgrades, I think, is mitigated with us because we haven't artificially driven that into the base.\nMichael Rollins: And on the sub price sensitivity, are you just -- are you seeing more sensitivity in price to grow the broadband base on a net level going forward?\nJessica Fischer: I mean I think we've said that the issue in broadband is activity. It hasn't been that there's additional price sensitivity. It's just that there's not a lot of movement in the market overall. And so I don't think that, that scenario is significantly different than what it's been before. We've always competed all across our footprint, and we continue to do that today. And the price sensitivity of that competition is not significantly different than it was in the past. Price has always been important and continues to be important. And that's why having packages that provide value to consumer helps us to grow subscribers and has helped us over time to grow subscribers at a faster pace than our competitors.\nTom Rutledge: The way I would -- if there were price issues with broadband, you'd see broadband disconnects, and they're at historic lows.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Mike. Katie, back to you.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom, and thanks for the kind words. I'm both honored and excited about the opportunity to continue to help Charter grow and to create shareholder value as the incoming CEO. It has also been a privilege for all of us here at Charter to work for and learn from Tom over the past 10 years. His leadership is the reason Charter exists as it does today, and he's mentored all of us here to keep reinventing cable and we're fortunate that he'll continue to do the same as our Executive Chairman. So Tom covered the quarterly headlines, so I thought I'd give some additional market color. While our Internet net additions improved from last quarter, they remained below last year. The largest driver by far is that activity level remains low. Total churn and voluntary churn were slightly lower year-over-year and were at all-time lows for third quarter. Non-pay and move churn remains well-below pre-pandemic levels. Those are market issues that also reduce our selling opportunities. While we've seen some improving trends, gross additions also remain down across the footprint by similar amounts in both overbuild and non-overbuild areas, similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. In terms of competitive impact, some of the lower gross additions we see probably relate to DSL conversion going to a new entrant, fixed wireless instead of coming to us. Given the issues with fixed wireless product reliability and scalability and usage trends, we expect those customers to find their way back to us over the long-term. We've also seen a similar pace of fiber reported telco Internet numbers confirm what we saw, a small mix issue from newly overbuilt footprint, no different from the past. I would also note that we've seen a small amount of market share return to mobile-only service over the past several quarters, the reversal of some COVID effects. So we're in a unique moment, the opposite of the one we saw in 2020 and early 2021, in fact. Market transaction volume will eventually pick up, and so will our Internet net adds. In the meantime, we're growing mobile at record rates, even in a low volume environment by saving customers thousands of dollars. That growth is also good for broadband. So we remain well positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband services continue to converge technically and operationally, and our Spectrum 1 offering launched earlier this month exemplifies that. As Tom mentioned, we have a path to drive significantly higher speeds, at a much faster pace and at much lower cost than our competitors. And we can sustain good revenue growth, lower cost of service per customer relationship for many years. I've been in the cable industry for almost 25 years and at Charter for over 10 years. And I've played a key role in developing our operating strategy. So our recipe for creating shareholder value through better products, pricing and packaging and service, coupled with a levered equity return strategy will remain intact. At the same time, I do think, the CEO transition will be a good opportunity for us, both in this market and with the transition taking place to update investors on what I expect over the next few years, including details of our network evolution plan, convergence capabilities, service experience for customers and our rural expansion and build-out plans. That's a lot to cover, so I look forward to a virtual event with the investment community that we'll schedule for a date, following the CEO transition in December. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. So I think there's -- similarly, maybe a little confusion out there about what Spectrum One is. And really, it's our first attempt and it may evolve over time. But Spectrum One packages seamless connectivity with our products, and they all work better together. It's offered at a first year promotional price. And as a result, our pricing of the underlying products, whether that's Internet, advanced WiFi and mobile, it has not changed. Even after that promotional period, Spectrum One creates values for customers in a way that our competitors really can't replicate. It's pretty similar to what was the design of Tom's original triple-play. And we also attach additional products or mobile lines to that promotional sell-in. So contrary to what I think is maybe a fear. We have not lowered our pricing in the marketplace, nor do we believe that we need to. Doug, on strategy shift, I mean, in the prepared remarks, I wanted to be clear, because I understand that's out there as well. I've been a player in developing our operating strategy here with Tom and John Bickham and others over the past decade. And just because somebody gives you a new title doesn't mean that your view on fundamentally how to create shareholder value changes overnight. So I'm pretty committed to all things that we're doing today in terms of our strategy around products, pricing, package, service. As I mentioned, our capital structure, obviously had a little bit of a hand in that as well in our balance sheet and M&A strategy. So I don't expect any seismic shifts. I've always thought that if we were going to do something anyway in terms of capital, might as well go get after it, so you can grow faster. And so, if there's opportunities to accelerate what we're already doing, we'll do that. But I don't think people should expect any fundamental changes and views on how we operate the business or how we create value for shareholders. So, two quick things, and then I'm going to pass it over to Jessica. On Spectrum One, we didn't launch that until October. So it had no impact on our Q3 results. And on your question regarding high split, we're going to go into lots of detail in December. So, I'm going to try to be quiet today around all that. There's nothing shocking. I think Tom and others may elaborate on the benefits of high spot, but we'll give a more detailed plan in December. The question is on the mobile. I'm going to hand that over to Jessica around the financials on mobile and she can go through that. I'll take the first one. I think Jessica mentioned in her prepared remarks, our view on core capital intensity in terms of outlook and she wouldn't have said that if we didn't collectively believe that was the case now and going forward. She mentioned excluding rural and that there may be some lumpiness as it relates to the timing of exactly how you get high split in supply chain and inventory and all that. But the core capital intensity continues to decline.  The leverage target, I've heard that rumor out in the marketplace. I find it a little bit funny because I've been at 4.5x since Switzerland since Germany since Charter, 4.5x and had a levered equity strategy for a really long time, probably over 20 years, and I helped put that together here at Charter and we have good growth. And the interest rates aren't all that different. In fact, it probably less for us as Charter today than when I got here at Charter. So, our views on how to create value through the operating strategy and how to pair that with the balance sheet and M&A strategy and a levered equity strategy, that hasn't changed.  And I mentioned the same thing in the prepared remarks is while we're on the topic, I know one of the other topics out there and I think Doug was going, there's -- do I believe that we need to do a fiber overbuild for our entire network. No, I don't think it makes a lot of sense to have operate two networks, which is what a lot of the overbuilders have had to do when they got into it. We have a really good path forward. It doesn't mean that we don't do fiber, we do fiber on the increment. There may be portions of the network longer term that we decide it's economical to do that. But for the most part and in fact, in its entirety the path that Tom laid out is the path that we're on. And we're not \u2013 I don't see any reason why want to go to a full fiber for build of perfectly otherwise good network that can be upgraded and dramatically lower cost and have the same capabilities. I'll jump in first. We haven't changed sorry, I just wanted to correct that I said we haven't lowered our pricing. Tom mentioned that we have passed through some of the inflationary cost increases, and that includes broadband should be indicative in terms of how you're thinking about that. And then on the fixed lines, I'm just throwing in a few pieces here and let others cover the rest. The fixed wireless access, the pricing really is designed for a full suite bundle of multiple mobile lines, and in some cases, high-priced mobile lines combined with the access. So I think the right comparison is if you take a look at our existing pricing in September with both broadband and mobile lines, because that's a comparable comparison. We're now with Spectrum One and compare that to the combined fixed wireless access offering. I think that's the best way to take a look at it. When you do that, you'll see that we're dramatically not only lower in terms of price and higher in terms of value, but the quality of the product is not really comparable. But I think that's the right way to think about those. You mentioned Spectrum One solution to the broadband growth issue we have right now. And I think it could be additive, but it's not the solution. The problem right now is market activity. And I know that's not the fashionable thing to say right now. But the biggest problem we face is market activity. And when that comes back, I think that's the solution to the broadband growth. And the Spectrum One has the opportunity, as Tom said, to drive incremental Internet growth. As well as still today, the biggest source of mobile growth is by far the upgrades to our existing Internet base, which should benefit that base as well. Cord cutting, the biggest driver here is the pricing of video. And the fact that we're having to pass through programming rate increases, which still continue to be outsized even relative to inflation means that customers have a difficulty affording it even if it's really something that they'd like to have. And so yes, it predominantly is driving downgrades of video. And retaining the connectivity. On broadband, it's a staple product, which insulated during that. But unlike many, we have not been pushing speed upgrades for the purpose of just generating rate. It's really been about when a customer wants a higher speed or feels they need a higher speed. That's when it's been offered and it's been offered at an attractive rate. And so the risk of the downgrade of the speed upgrades, I think, is mitigated with us because we haven't artificially driven that into the base."

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. As I look at our current advanced offerings, our future product plans and the underpenetration of our network, we're well positioned to grow our business at very attractive rates for many years to come. During the quarter, we added 75,000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains very low due to current consumer behavior. And while the lower year-over-year connect activity improved, connects remain challenged due to the low activity environment. We continue to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 396,000, our best quarter yet. Over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50% and as of the end of the quarter, we had nearly 4.7 million total mobile lines. Our opportunity in mobile is very large, and we're still at the beginning of developing that business. Today, we only captured 28% of the combined household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So we remain significantly underpenetrated versus the opportunity in front of us. And we're delivering the fastest Internet and the fastest Wi-Fi speeds in the nation and the fastest mobile speeds when combined with Wi-Fi, all the while serving customers -- saving customers, I should say, thousands of dollars a year. Today, we have close to 500 million devices connected to our network, the vast majority of which are connected to us wirelessly. Ultimately, I expect that virtually all devices connected to our network will connect wirelessly. To continue to improve our services, we also remain focused on evolving our network to offer the fastest speeds in the most cost and time-efficient manner. Data usage continues to grow at a fast pace. Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 700 gigabytes per month. Nearly 25% of those customers use a terabyte or more of data per month. The downstream traffic still dominates usage at a ratio of 14:1 versus upstream traffic. In the near-term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity bi-directionally and allow us to allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our existing DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Our network evolution path also includes DOCSIS 4.0, so we can maintain a state-of-the-art network that delivers the most compelling converged connectivity services in a capital and time-efficient manner and turn offer those advanced services to consumers at highly attractive prices. As you may know, I plan to step down as CEO on December 1st that time, Chris Winfrey will become our new CEO, and I will become Executive Chairman. It's been personally fulfilling to lead Charter over the last 10 years. We've grown our company through innovation and strategic investments that position Charter to provide the best connectivity products and services available today everywhere we operate. Our products have continually evolved and changed the world during my career from the carriage of broadcast signals when I began to the development of robust video and multi-channel cable networks. And from the early days of broadband, Internet and voice to now offering fully ubiquitous wireless connectivity, we continue to drive new uses for our networks to bring value to consumers and our opportunity to innovate and grow is greater today than ever before. Having worked closely with Chris for more than 10 years, I know that he's the right choice to be our next CEO. He will serve Charter with both vision and skill leading the company to new heights. Chris' leadership and expertise in both operations and finance have been pivotal to Charter's growth and success over the past 10 years. He's repeatedly demonstrated in a strategic insight in key market and industry awareness to drive our organization to perform at the highest levels. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Chris. Thanks, Doug. Yes, your memory is good. And I'll turn the answer over to Chris. But when triple-play was first announced, there was a lot of skepticism, and some people thought it was foolish, but it turned out to be quite successful. Yes, at a high level, Ben, on spectrum splits, what they essentially do is give you the opportunity to increase down speeds and upstream speeds significantly and to offer products symmetrically at pretty low capital cost. When we did DOCSIS 3.1, you remember, we spent about $9 a point past, not counting CPE, and -- which was $450 million approximately to get the plant ready. This is going to cost a little more than that, but it's still a relatively low-cost capital investment that gives you a significant increase in capacity. And it leaves you in a pathway where you can continue to invest with additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0 to even further enhance the capability of the network at a pretty capital-efficient way that gives you massive capacity and moves us to the 10G world we've been talking about over time. And as a general concept, it takes away additional operating costs as well and additional capital cost when you make these investments because the augmentation in the network that you have to do for growth, I talked in my prepared remarks about how much capacity people are using that capacity use continues to go up. So, this -- and we have a normal capital budget associated with that growth in capacity. And when you do these spectrum split upgrades, you get that capacity included with that investment. So, you don't have to make the augmentation investment. So, it's a very efficient way of ubiquitously deploying lots of capability across your entire footprint. And I think the cable industry, in general, will have that capacity across its entire footprint very relatively quickly. There's a lot in those in that question. First, with regard to my timing, actually, two years ago, put in my contract that on August 15th of this year, I would have an option in my employment agreement to begin the process of transitioning to Executive Chairman and giving up the CEO role. I chose that date two years ago, because it was the 50th anniversary of my beginning in cable as a technician working my way through college in 1972. So I have personal meaning to me, and I thought it was a milestone a couple of years ago that I might want to exercise. And then the other thought I had was at the end of this Executive Chairmanship, I'd be 70 years old, and I thought well, maybe I should think about not working after that age. But on the other hand, I was -- I love this business and I love what the future is for this business, and there's tremendous opportunity. And I want to see it through, but it's going to -- it's just such a good business and it's going to go on so long that it's time to pass at the time. So that's how I came to the decision. To your broadband cost questions, yeah, there are cost issues and we've had to deal with those costs and they're in our numbers. In this quarter, you can see that there's some inflationary pressure out there, and there have been labor force dislocations as a result of COVID and the economic policies that the country employed to deal with it. And they're significant, but we've -- our strategy from a pricing and packaging perspective is to be the value provider and to make these products work together at lower prices and create good value for consumers and to use our ability to drive market share as the primary driver of our revenue, but that said, we have been passing through video price increases, and we've passed through recently a broadband price increase and it was a result of the inflationary pressures that we've seen. At the same time, it doesn't negate the way our primary revenue opportunity is developing, which is to create more customers faster and to create those customers with more products associated with each connection so that our ARPU and the revenue go up together. And that's the primary driver of our revenue strategy. Our cost strategy though is real, and we are working in RDOF to develop we have had higher costs than we anticipated, but we've also had more success than we anticipated in terms of both penetration and the number of passings that we can develop off of the RDOF projects that we've built. So net-net, our cost is what we thought it would be on a per passing basis. But it does create pressure and difficulty for people to attract labor and to get things done. And so we're having issues ourselves with supply chain and the development of a workforce and how we do the work and what order we do work is being impacted by the labor market and the supply market. So I do think the cost of money and the cost of labor and the cost of everything will affect our competitors' ability to build as well. Thank you. Thank you, Phil. Yes. And I guess I would just add that that opportunity for our ability to continue to grow against the market share is significant. I said in my prepared remarks that we're 28% penetrated in terms of dollar takeout of consumer spend for mobile and for broadband combined. And so we have this big physical infrastructure where every customer we connect to it requires no real significant capital. And the opportunity for us to drive growth using that network with superior products at attractive prices is huge and the dollar value of what's in front of us is huge. And so that's the big opportunity in our structure. And it really hasn't changed. The fact that, we have mobility associated with our broadband products now and a combined product really means that you have very high-priced mobile products with very small usage on a bandwidth basis, and we can add those into our product mix very attractively for consumers. And when we look at what consumers are spending, we can save those consumers a lot of money. So that's the basic concept. And it hasn't changed. And what has changed is the technologies we're using and the product sets and how they're combined, but the basic notion of there's a huge marketplace with a lot of spend in it, and we're not getting much of it, and we'd like to get more, and we will. Peter, to the first part of your question, I'd say yes we expect to be able to pull the broadband growth through. It's a complicated sale, obviously, but yes. Thank you But not disconnects of... Yes. And in many cases, we disconnect the video customer downgraded video customer and sell a mobile package at the same time. And they actually end up saving money, obviously, because they have no video or they buy a smaller video package from us in many cases. But they also end up driving ARPU up in the sense that they buy mobile and that mobile is a good value for them. Their overall hospital spend savings -- it is a savings. I'll try to answer that. I've been through a lot of recessions in my career. And I have a hard time remembering them because our business performed so well during them. And the reason is that our products are really attractive even when consumers are under stress. Obviously, there's a certain amount of stress that you can't overcome. And video, I think, will be challenged. But on the other hand, it's a very attractive product if you're unemployed. And it's still, even at the high price that it is a, good value relative to other forms of entertainment. So \u2013 but the reality is that in a recessionary environment when people become more price-sensitive, the value proposition that we offer with our everyday pricing is superior to what they can get elsewhere, which means that we actually become more attractive when people are more conscious of the price they're paying for other products. And so I'm not that worried about a recession from our company's perspective. So we're not hoping for a recession, but... The way I would -- if there were price issues with broadband, you'd see broadband disconnects, and they're at historic lows."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to mention that today's results do not include any impact related to Hurricane Ian, which hit the East Coast in late September. Initially, approximately 1 million of our customers lost service, primarily because of power outages, but our crews worked hard to repair our network and reconnect customers, and they did a great job. Broadly speaking, our plant fared well despite the storm and service was destroyed to nearly to all impacted customers in relatively short period of time. And while we expect our fourth quarter results to contain some bill credits, some incremental CapEx related to plant replacement and some incremental operating expense related to store cleanup and call center labor, we expect the overall impact of Hurricane Ian on our financials and customer numbers will be very small. Let's turn to customer results on slide five. Including residential and SMB, we added 75,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. Video customers declined by $204,000 in the third quarter, following a programming pass-through increase in the second quarter. Wireline voice declined by 271,000, and we added a record 396,000 mobile lines despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service. Looking forward, we expect our new Spectrum 1 offer to drive accelerating mobile line growth. Moving to financial results, starting on slide six. Over the last year, residential customers grew by $123,000 or 0.4% year-over-year. Residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year with promotional rate step-ups and rate adjustments, offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, higher expanded basic video losses in the last several quarters and accelerated growth of lower-priced video packages within our base. Our year-over-year residential revenue per customer relationship growth was lower this quarter than last, given the timing of rate adjustments in this year versus last and the mix factors I just mentioned. Also, keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 0.7% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 1.9% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.3%. Enterprise revenue was up by 2.6% year-over-year or by 5.2% year-over-year when excluding some one-time fees from the prior period, which were a benefit last year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 9% and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year. Third quarter advertising revenue grew by 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by political revenue. Core ad revenue was flat year-over-year with lower national and local advertising revenue, offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $750 million with $303 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue declined by 2.1% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers mostly offset by rural construction initiatives subsidies. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 3.1% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In Q3, total operating expenses grew by $278 million or 3.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 3.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2022, we now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low single-digit percentage range. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined 7.4% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower video CPE sold to customers. For the full year 2022, we now expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range. Cost to service customers increased by 4.4% year-over-year. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 3%, primarily due to higher fuel and freight costs, partly offset by productivity improvements. And while bad debt and non-pay churn were higher year-over-year, both remain well below pre-COVID levels. We now expect cost to service customers expense growth for the second half of 2022 to be more consistent with growth in the first half of 2022. Marketing expenses grew by 9.3% year-over-year, primarily due to higher staffing levels and wages, as Charter focuses on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we now expect marketing expense to grow in the high single-digit percentage range. Mobile expenses totaled $846 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 4.4%, primarily driven by higher labor costs, higher advertising sales expense related to political revenue and higher computer and software expense, partly offset by lower corporate costs this quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, essentially flat with last year, with higher adjusted EBITDA offset by higher interest expense. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $1.9 billion. Most of that increase was driven by $525 million of spend on our rural construction initiative in the quarter, and the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions. In rural, we've accelerated our walkout and design nationally to allow for additional time for the process of securing full access. In addition, our access to inventory is improving, so we're carrying a more appropriate amount of inventory to support the belt. As a result, we now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion this year on the rural construction initiative. We spent $96 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back office systems. Core cable CapEx, which excludes our rural and mobile CapEx, increased from $1.7 billion last year to $1.8 billion this quarter, driven by modestly higher CPE and scalable infrastructure spending. We continue to expect core cable capital expenditures to be between $7.1 billion and $7.3 billion for the full year 2022. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.5 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx, mostly driven by our rural construction initiative. Excluding cash taxes, our rural construction initiative and litigation settlements, free cash flow grew by 5% year-over-year. We finished the quarter with $96.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.8 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.48 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.8 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $2.6 billion at an average price of $445 per share. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yes. So, mobile EBITDA losses remained due to a few things. The first one, I'm sure you saw this is our best quarter yet for mobile growth, and we continue to have additional sort of customer acquisition costs because of that, that weigh on mobile EBITDA. Also, we did see both in mobile and in the cable side increases in bad debt in the year-over-year. And so there's some of that that's impacting mobile EBITDA. And we did implement a new system earlier in the year. I think Tom has talked about it. And we're still sort of working through the last of the costs related to having implemented that system. And so there's a little weight there that I think will come down as we settle in a bit more. But the key here is that you should know that gross margin in the mobile product continues to be very good. And as Chris mentioned, Spectrum One, while it offers a promotional price on mobile, we're both selling additional lines in with that promotional offer and at our rack rate, which that rolls to in 12 months, we make very solid margins off of the mobile business. And because of that, we remain will remain profitable in that business absent the growth cost even with the promotional pricing to drive overall customer relationships. And I think given what we've seen in the field implementations that have happened so far, our confidence in the capital efficiency of the implementation as well as our ability to do it at speed have both grown versus even, I would say, where we were last quarter or the quarter before. So very good progress and what we've seen both in the field and from the supplier community as to how that upgrade will be able to be executed in. Yes. The advantage that we have there against many of them is scale. So certainly, when it comes to being able to acquire and then to move supply around the areas where we're ready and most able to build. I think that we have -- we continue to have a very good ability to do that. And really on the cost of capital side, the advantage that we have is a large amount of free cash flow that we're able to deploy really what's a relatively small portion of to execute on these builds. So we're not as beholden to borrowing on a regular basis to fund our builds as some others in the market are. So I think we continue to be well positioned. The rural builds are actually performing at least as well or actually better than we expected. And from a financial perspective, I'm still confident in where we are on the returns that we had said that we would have against those belts. On the rural side, I guess on your first question, the contribution to broadband subs. Certainly, we are seeing broadband subs coming in off of the rural build that we're executing already. I think I've said that we will start providing some more detailed information about femoral build and we weren't quite to do that this quarter. But I would expect coming into year-end that will provide some better information. It's not the entire growth in broadband.  So the growth that you see, the 75,000 additions reflects growth off of our legacy footprint as well as some \u2013 a smaller amount of incremental growth off of the broadband subs. But we are doing very well in those markets that we build out. As far as thinking about how you should think about rural for next year, I don't want to front run giving guidance on that piece just yet.  I would tell you that I think what we did in this year to try to accelerate, walk out and design is certainly in an effort to be able to build the rural builds at a good pace, which I think is both consistent with what strategically we'd like to do because having the passings and service sooner than later is good for the business.  And from a regulatory perspective, we are certainly doing everything that we can to meet expectations on that side as well and in placing the build in service. But I don't, on that basis sort of have a number to give you for next year. I'd just tell you that I would expect our pace to continue to be strong because we're trying to build what we need to build as quickly as we're able to do so. And I guess, in terms of how that then translates into EBITDA trajectory, Jonathan, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone that based on the lower broadband customer growth that we've had over the last year, really coming out of the really accelerated growth in those customers and we pull forward during COVID will mean that we had kind of higher revenue growth followed by what's likely to be somewhat lower revenue growth versus that COVID time period. But I think based on what Tom talked about that then as we sort of execute on the converge connectivity plan and as we see it return to normalcy in the market, we certainly expect that in the medium to long-term, that that will pick up back-up and so that you will have that increasing revenue growth again. Similarly on the expense side, we certainly have seen some impact, and I think we called out some of the impact of inflation in the financials in Q3. But we think that, that sort of once again sort of, is it temporary crunch on growth that is consistent with what people had what we think that people expect. But it will be followed by a return to more normal levels. And so ultimately, in the medium and long term, I think that the trajectory of EBITDA growth is back closer to pre-pandemic levels. But I acknowledge that, I think that, there could be a little bit of slowness in that growth in the short term. So I'll take the last one of those first. There was some impact of the EBB to ACP conversion on broadband in the quarter. It was much smaller than it was last quarter, and we expect it to be much smaller going forward. So I don't think we'll call it out at all separately. And I would call Internet ARPU growth in the year-over-year. Overall ARPU was flat, but Internet ARPU was up 2.2%. If you included mobile and overall ARPU, it would have been up $1.60 versus last year. So we think that there is ARPU growth happening in the market, really largely driven by mix issues and by our ability to penetrate the market further on the mobile side, driving additional, I'd say, real growth of the business beyond just what you can get from a pricing perspective. So we feel like we're doing well there. I don't think that we'll give guidance on what ARPU growth we expect going forward, but that's what we are seeing now. On sequential growth, I guess, I would point out a couple of things. One, I highlighted in the prepared remarks, which was that the growth that we saw in Q2 was impacted by pricing adjustments that we had taken for video pass-through. And the way that those overlap year-over-year, you actually had the impact of two in the second quarter versus only one in the third quarter. So that's part of what was happening there. They're also in enterprise, commercial. There was a one-time item that was a benefit in last year that you don't have in this year that pressured those growth rates in the year-over-year or in the sequential quarter. So some of what you're seeing there is just the impact of lumpiness, not overall growth trajectory. On the leverage point, I would say that where we're sitting right now, the free cash flow yield on equity is so high that I think that continuing to do share buybacks presents significant opportunity for the company, just based on where we're sitting on that point. And the overall capital structure, I think, has been an advantage to the company in the long-term. And so I don't see where we are even in what might be a temporarily pressured growth environment as being a reason to move off of where we've been from a leverage standpoint or as your buyback strategy? And so consistent with what I said, we certainly expect to stay at the top of our four to four and a half times leverage ratio. So, on the debt repurchase question, I also have noticed that our debt is trading at a discount in the market. We do modeling consistently as to what we think the best option as between the two is, particularly given our plans to stay at the top end of our leverage range. And so I won't comment on anything in particular that we plan to do. But we do certainly notice it. And we'll continue to do our modeling, and we'll make the next decision based on what appears appropriate given where the market sits at that moment. And there might be some impacts that you would see in a space like advertising enterprise. But the performance that we could get in mobile, particularly given our pricing there would be good. And even if it had video downgrades on the other side, the margins in mobile are actually better than the margins in the video. So you get some advantage of more customers moving into the mobile side of the business as well. We'll be fine. I mean I think we've said that the issue in broadband is activity. It hasn't been that there's additional price sensitivity. It's just that there's not a lot of movement in the market overall. And so I don't think that, that scenario is significantly different than what it's been before. We've always competed all across our footprint, and we continue to do that today. And the price sensitivity of that competition is not significantly different than it was in the past. Price has always been important and continues to be important. And that's why having packages that provide value to consumer helps us to grow subscribers and has helped us over time to grow subscribers at a faster pace than our competitors."

We ask that you please hold your questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instruction for the question and answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead, sir.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter's second quarter 2022 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today's call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey, our COO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. Our business continues to grow despite an unusual macroeconomic environment. During the second quarter, we added 38,000 Internet customers when excluding an unfavorable impact related to the discontinuation of the emergency broadband benefit, EBB, program and additional definitional requirements of the affordable connectivity program. Customer relationship is churn remains historically low due to current consumer behaviour and connect activity remains low primarily due to the low activity environment. At the same time, we continue to see very strong mobile line growth with line net additions of approximately 350,000. And over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4.3 million total mobile lines. Financials were also strong in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue grew by 6.2%, and EBITDA grew by 9.7%. Looking forward, we remain well positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband service continues to converge technically and operationally. We offer them along with all of our other high-quality products at attractive prices. Our growth is driven by offering value-rich packages that differentiate us from our competition at prices customers can afford regardless of the economic environment. And we plan to continue to do that. To continue to improve our service, we are focused on evolving our network. Data usage continues to grow at a very fast pace. During the second quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 650 gigabytes per month. Nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. And even with the rise of work from home, peak usage patterns still prevail, but the vast majority of data usage occurring during the evening hours. Our network is built to handle that peak demand and delivers consistent speeds regardless of the time of day. With our dense HFC network, we deliver gigabit speeds today everywhere we offer service. And in the near term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity and allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Our long-term network evolution path includes DOCSIS 4.0. Recent testing using DOCSIS 4.0 technology simultaneously delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream in a 4 amplifier cascade to a single mode. We will develop this technology even further, but the test demonstrated that we can successfully drive bidirectional multi-gigabit speed offerings across our entire network in a very capital-efficient manner and without the major disruption to our customers and operations that other kinds of upgrades require. So we can deliver a future-proof network that delivers the most compelling connectivity services in a capital and time-efficient manner and, in turn, offer those services to consumers at highly attractive prices. But we're not only working to improve speeds and latency in our network. We're also working to improve network quality and reliability, reducing service transactions driving longer customer lives and reducing churn. We're doing that through better maintenance practices, using artificial intelligence, telemetry and machine learning technologies to drive what we call operational intelligence. We're now able to ingest, aggregate, correlate and analyze millions of data points from our network, offering us intelligence about the health of our network, services and anomalies in our network that are critical to the customer experience. In the past, this type of real-time network intelligence did not exist, and substantial human effort and manual analysis were required to manage our network, which was time-consuming and brought only limited insights and required thousands of service transactions. In many cases, our intelligence now allows us to avoid network outages and disruptions altogether, maintaining the plant more efficiently with far less activity and cost and fewer outages in service transactions. Our mobile business is growing at an extremely rapid pace. We remain the fastest-growing mobile provider in the nation, and we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offerings, helping to drive customer growth and making our mobile business economics, which are good, even better. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're able to offer consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, we capture less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offerings, we can do that, which, in turn, raises connects, reduces churn and drives overall customer relationship growth. In addition, our mobile business will drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter, even at our existing and very attractive mobile price points, giving us EBITDA growth simply by growing our mobile customer base. We're underpenetrated, and our opportunity is large. Charter remains uniquely positioned to deliver superior services at superior prices, offering consumers the most attractive products for their connectivity needs. Our services remain the best choice for consumers, giving us the opportunity to continue to grow our business at a very healthy pace.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Tom. Now let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we lost 21,000 Internet customers in the second quarter. As part of the EBB to ACP transition, a small portion of subsidized Internet customers either did not opt to continue their service after the EBB program ended or did not meet the ACP requirements, particularly the requirement that customers use their service in each 30-day period, which covers the vast majority of the impacted subscribers. This resulted in 59,000 customer disconnects during the quarter. Excluding that headwind, we organically grew 38,000 Internet customers in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect that zero usage ACP customers will have a smaller impact in our quarterly results than what we saw this quarter. Looking at the broader marketplace, while we saw seasonal increases in moves typical of the second quarter, moves remained well below pre-COVID levels. And voluntary churn, when excluding the EBB-ACP impact I mentioned, was even lower than last year, all of which reduced our selling opportunities. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 226,000 in the second quarter, following a programming pass-through increase. Wireline voice declined by $266,000, and we added 344,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by $282,000 or 1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2.8% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups and earlier video rate adjustments versus last year that pass-through program rerate increases. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 4.5% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.7%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 8.2%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.7% year-over-year. Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 12% year-over-year. That growth came primarily from political. It was slightly offset by a 1% decline in our core advertising business due to lower local and national advertising revenue, including auto, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $726 million with $299 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 8% -- 8. 8% year-over-year and includes rural construction initiatives subsidies totaling $29 million. In total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 6.2% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In 2Q, total operating expenses grew by $307 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.2% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, all of which was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2022, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 10.3% primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs and lower video CPE sold to customers. The decline in Lakers and RSN costs was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges in 2Q '21, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 4.7%. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021 primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given an abnormal Lakers game schedule last year. Cost to service customers increased by 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt year-over-year given lower bad debt in the second quarter of 2021, which benefited from government stimulus packages at the time. And while this quarter's nonpaid churn and bad debt write-offs both remain well below pre-COVID levels, our bad debt accrual includes expectations for potential softening of consumer finances later this year. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.1% primarily due to a larger customer base and higher fuel costs partly offset by productivity improvements. As the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive slower growth in cost to service customers expense during the second half of the year. Marketing expenses grew by 8.6% year-over-year due to higher labor costs driven by previously planned wage increases and higher staffing levels as Charter completes the insourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect marketing expense to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021. Mobile expenses totaled $797 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue. Customer acquisition and service and operating costs and other expenses increased by 1.3%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Just a quick note on inflation before moving on to net income. We've seen some inflationary pressure in fuel, freight and utilities as well as pricing pressure on CPE and other network components. In labor, our planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage blunted the impact, but we still see pressure in the labor market, which we may need to more fully respond to as the year progresses. I would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure. But given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe that we're well positioned for this environment. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.5 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $1 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in the second quarter above last year's second quarter spend of $1.9 billion. We spent a total of $357 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that then relates to design, walk out and make ready, and as expected, has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions. We spent $95 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back-office systems and wireless offload construction. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.7 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.1 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx mostly driven by our rural construction initiatives. We finished the quarter with $95.7 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.5 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $4.3 billion at an average price of $511 per share. And given where the share price has been, during the first two quarters of this year, we repurchased 7.2% of our fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, for approximately $7.8 billion. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: A couple on sort of competition and your go-to-market. You guys didn't talk a lot about fixed wireless or the fiber builds that are happening in various parts of the country. I'm just wondering if you could comment on whether that competitive intensity has increased, if you're seeing, in particular, pressure in certain parts of your footprint, including in the third quarter. I realize you don't like to comment quarterly, but obviously, there's a lot of focus on that. And then Tom, I was interested in your comment about generating mobile EBITDA because it would seem like there's maybe some tension between sort of passing on efficiencies in that business to the consumer through lower prices, which can drive volume and maybe drive broadband volume as it gets pulled through by mobile. But that tension exists versus sort of trying to make as much money as you can in that business. Just wondering if you could comment on how you think about balancing that, particularly as you move more traffic on network.\nTom Rutledge: Sure. I'll start there. Look, there's always a tension between how you price a product and how much of it you drive into the marketplace. And the difference between price and volume -- and price and the volume you get ultimately is -- what you're trying to get to is the maximum amount of cash flow that you can generate out of the business based at the right price and the right volume distribution of that product at that price. . So that's what we're seeking in mobile, and we think it's a huge opportunity for us. It's -- obviously, we're creating customer relationships. Those customers are paying us. There's good margin in that business and at the pricing that we have. And we think that we can get more efficient through time with that margin by offload. And at the same time, we think we're accretive to our MVNO partner and that the 9 million customers that have been created out of that MVNO are accretive and valuable, too, and should be really counted as customers in many ways to our MVNO partner. But that's a shared relationship and -- but the net of all of that is that we have an opportunity at the pricing that we have to continue to grow the business, and that pricing is really valuable relative to the price in the marketplace that those products are currently being offered by our competitors. And at the prices we're offering it now, we have an opportunity to create great value for us through time and to have an improving margin through time as well. But even without an improving margin, it's still a great value. So we're in a pretty good place in terms of our mobile business in that we have lots of opportunity. We have a fully penetrated marketplace, and we have a very small share of it, and we're growing rapidly. With regard to the overall competitive environment, our churn and -- is extremely low. And activity levels in the marketplace are the biggest competitive our biggest impact on our growth rates relative to historic growth rates. The fiber competition that we have is typical. If you go back to the second quarter of 2019 and look at fiber growth, it's not much different, although the footprint's bigger. And there is a new fixed wireless competitor. It's actually relatively small. It's not the major component of our quarterly performance, but it is a factor. If you look at the numbers that the fixed wireless competitors say they're taking from cable and proportionately look at that across our footprint, if you do the math, it's not the major driver of the change in second quarter '19 versus second quarter of 2022. What's -- the major driver is the activity levels. But also, there are other factors that are -- RDOF construction is beginning to ramp up. So that's an opportunity for us. Housing occupancy and new construction is lower because of supply chain issues. So that's -- I think we'll get fixed in the -- in time, but it's an issue affecting growth at the moment. And so we're pretty optimistic, relatively speaking, that as the post-pandemic market activity levels return and normalize, that our share of broadband growth will rise. And we're pretty optimistic that our mobile business is highly accretive and a huge opportunity for us going forward.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nVijay Jayant: A couple for me. One, really move churn is a phenomenon that is sort of new to us and what it sort of meets the subs. Can you sort of help us understand, is your share of the gross ARPU higher than the share of moveouts that have your service? I think it needs to be for low move activity to be negative for net adds. And if that's the case, how has that sort of shifted over time? And obviously, you announced that you've increased your speeds by about 100 megabits for your service, but it was not on the upstream. Can you just talk about the importance of upstream? Obviously, the fiber guys keep talking about that being a well advantage for them and how that's impacted the service so far.\nChris Winfrey: Vijay, can you clarify on your first question a little bit more? I didn't fully understand what you meant by the new first flow. This is Chris.\nVijay Jayant: So your share of the gross ARPU -- gross ARPU, is that higher than your share of moveouts that have your service, so given move churn as a factor? For that to -- needs to be for the low -- it needs to be for low move activity to be a negative for net adds, I think. So I'm just trying to understand like this move churn phenomena and people moving in and out, how that sort of impacts the gross add opportunity.\nTom Rutledge: Yes, I think the way I would say what I think you're saying is we're a net share taker when there's a toss-up. And there's more toss-ups in -- when people are moving. And so therefore, our gross adds out of moves is higher than -- of all moves is higher than our disconnect rate of all moves. That's what you're saying.\nChris Winfrey: And we're still a net share taker. You're in a Q2 where move activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels, nonpay churn well below pre-pandemic levels. We also saw the return of seasonality in college markets that didn't occur last year. So we expect to see those gross additions come back in August and September. So it was a seasonal Q2 where you had low move nonpay and our lowest to lever voluntary churn when you exclude this EBB impact. And so without that activity, I think what you're asking is if we were in a normalized environment, are we still in that share taker. And the answer is yes.\nTom Rutledge: That's our expectation. With regard to downstreams and upstreams, usage is still significant. 14:1 downstream versus upstream. And so from a practical point of view, our products are appropriate. We think, over the longer term, upstream use will continue, but it isn't actually growing faster than the downstream use at the moment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: I wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about the broadband growth equation going forward, what you expect from broadband ARPU and -- going forward and then how much you think that with RDOF and the early state level Jobs Act awards you've gotten, how much do you think broadband homes passed, and so just how you think about the sort of equation for total broadband growth? And then separately, could you just comment on the degree that you think you can offload wireless traffic? I think you called out your CBRS buildout for the first time in today's materials. What level of traffic do you think you can actually offload onto that network?\nTom Rutledge: In terms of broadband opportunities in rural areas, we've won about 1. 5 million passing so far in the RDOF program and the various state programs. There's a lot of bids that we have outstanding at the state level. And there's a $42 billion fund coming next year, which is a huge amount of money, which will allow for additional construction, which we hope to bid on and be successful with. We haven't actually begun to offload on the CBRS yet in a commercial way. But it's interesting, our WiFi-first strategy in our mobile relationship with our customers allows significant offload mobile traffic onto the WiFi network. So when you put those two things together, the success we're having in a managed WiFi first environment and the potential success of CBRS, that's what I was saying before. We have a good relationship in our MVNO today with good volume-based pricing and significant margins and an opportunity if we're continuously successful to make that even better by moving some of the traffic onto -- additional traffic on to WiFi and onto our own 5G CBRS network. So it's a good situation that can get a lot better.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. Craig, on the broadband growth, I'd just add that similar to what we were talking about with Vijay, the market transaction volume eventually is going to pick up. So our Internet net adds will pick up again. We're confident in that. And our recipe for broadband growth has always been about being competitive and price competitive in the marketplace. And we've had new entrants and overbuild for many, many years. So when you asked the question about ARPU, I assume it relates a little bit to competitive. And I don't see a major change there in terms of our strategy and how we go to market or how we need to go to market. In fact, I would argue because of the mobile product and the converged mobile product that Tom was talking about and the ability to put these together and that we can save customers money, significant dollars, that has both good volume and ARPU impacts for broadband over time. So I think the outlook is still very, very strong. .\nOperator: Our next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: A couple of questions. One, just curious, based on your comment about the test on DOCSIS 4.0, what percent of your footprint is covered at plus 4? And when do you think that equipment will be ready for prime time? And then I guess, Tom, but maybe just a jump ball, I'm just curious when we think about stressing the consumer whether inflation impact in their walls are ultimately Fed interest rate increases impact on the economy and overall consumer spending, where would you expect to see any pressures from the consumer in your business first? Have you seen anything so far? And where would you expect to see it? And I'm just curious if you reflect back, you think about the great recession and consumer walls got tighter and there was some readdressing of pay TV spending and tiering. Do you see across your businesses, any risk of tiering down? And how would you manage against that? So I know not a fun question, but I'm just curious how you think about that given your history.\nTom Rutledge: Our doom and gloom question. Well, okay. In terms of DOCSIS 4.0, -- it hasn't been deployed. Our footprint right now is DOCSIS 3.1 fully. So we have 1 gig everywhere. The DOCSIS 3.1 upgrade opportunity is still significant, meaning we haven't gotten everything out of DOCSIS 3.1 by any means in terms of its full capacity. It can give us multi-gigabit speeds downstream and gigabit symmetrical speeds, upstream. And so it's a quite robust infrastructure that's already been deployed. And the CPE for that has already been deployed. DOCSIS 4.0 is a complete new electronic drop-in and a whole new modulation scheme and so bars new CPE. And it is not being deployed yet, but it's in the lab and the specs have been written, and it's another technology upgrade that will allow us to get to very high speeds without having to replace our network, which means that you can do that in a really capitally efficient way, which means that ultimately, you have pricing opportunities that others don't. And that's the value of DOCSIS 4.0. . With regard to inflation and its impact on macroeconomic forces on us, look, I mean, I think we have access to capital and at good prices. I think that inflation in some ways, particularly if it's temporary, has some market advantages for us. As consumers are stressed, the value of our products become more clear in the consumer's mind. If you look at how much consumers are spending on telecom products and our share of those telecom products and what we can do with pricing for those telecom products, I think a stressed consumer will find our products even more attractive. So I mean, yes, we'll have to deal with costs. But it's interesting when you look at our overall business and look at our cost structures, we're getting more efficient. And our opportunity to serve and our cost to serve continues to improve. And if we drive more customers, that actually improves on a per customer basis. So we can operate in a difficult economic environment, and we can -- and make our products valuable to consumers. So I'm -- I'd rather operate in a normal environment, but I think we have pretty good assets and pretty good opportunities to be successful.\nJessica Fischer: The thing that I would add to that, we've been big proponents on the affordability side. And as part of that, we are a larger participant in the affordable connectivity program than many of the other -- well, to the best of our knowledge, all of the other wireline providers. And we've done a lot to try to push the program to our existing subscribers so not as an acquisition program that is a way to alleviate some of the stress on the consumer while it's in our customer base. And I think that, that also puts us in a better position than we would have been in 2008 to retain customers and to do so by providing value to them in a more challenged environment or where the wallet is more challenged. .\nTom Rutledge: I do think video would be more challenged in a downturn or an inflationary environment than other products, but the margins are relatively -- have become smaller in that part of our business. So the net of it all is, I think it's somewhat of a market opportunity, but it's -- there will be stress on video.\nDoug Mitchelson: Yes. And just a final clarification, Tom. At 4 amplifiers for DOCSIS 4.0, I get that it will be a while before it arrives. Would that cover the vast majority of your network? Or would you be invested in seeing 6 amplifiers?\nJessica Fischer: Doug, I think the point of the example around 4 amplifiers is that the technology can work in an amplifier cascade that would allow it to cover a large portion of our network without having to move the nodes closer to the customers necessarily. So I think it's performance in that environment in the lab at this point is a strong example of how it is that we can make it capital efficient when we deploy it down the road. .\nTom Rutledge: Yes, it could get better.\nJessica Fischer: It could get better.\nTom Rutledge: And it probably will. That would be our expectation and our experience with these kind of platforms.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Two quick ones, if I may. First, it seems like wireless is becoming an increasingly important piece of the business. And one of the pieces that maybe investors don't understand so well is how it contributes to EBITDA because, on an aggregate basis, it's still a drag. Can you give us some idea of what the incremental margin is on a wireless level, what the contribution to EBITDA per sub is from wireless, what gives fiber sub? And then on broadband, can you give us a sense of sort of how you saw trends progress as you came out of June into July?\nChris Winfrey: So Jonathan, I'll take this one. On the wireless, the -- it is increasingly important, and I don't think it's well understood by the marketplace. It has a reported EBITDA loss right now, but that's entirely driven by subscriber acquisition cost for sales and marketing. The EBITDA for wireless passed the positive point really some time ago. I don't remember what quarter, but it's probably a year plus. So it's an attractive product, and we're growing it fast, and I -- we're not going to get into margin analysis or forecast. But I will tell you that the -- everything that I've ever looked at that people publish on the topic grossly underestimates our margin that's inherent inside that business and what we can do with it to drive the business overall, including broadband net additions. So it's powerful. I don't think it's very well understood, and that's okay for now. The second question was what was on volume?\nJessica Fischer: Volume in June-July.\nTom Rutledge: On volume, yes. .\nChris Winfrey: Yes. Look, that's a tough question because you've got a seasonal disconnect period that goes through June and July. You've heard me mention earlier that we have had a more return to seasonal disconnects in our college markets, which actually bodes well for August and September, assuming that comes back. I would say that our medium and long-term confidence is very high, will be back market overturn with net activity. Short term, it's just difficult to see with volume and July is a very difficult month to go ask that question. So we'll see.\nTom Rutledge: And just one other comment on wireless and its impact, just we are a wireless company. And we have 450 million wireless devices connected to our network -- which is when you -- so you think about -- and when you think about our new video strategy, our new joint venture with Sumo and our ability to connect video customers in the future wirelessly, all of our products would be wirelessly delivered.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBryan Kraft: I was wondering if I could ask you how you're thinking these days about potential acquisitions in the cable business or even other types of assets, whether it's business services or wireless? And maybe in cable specifically, if you could talk about just how you would evaluate a potential deal today.\nTom Rutledge: Well, we've always said we love cable, which is why we've been buying our own stock back because we haven't been able to buy cable. And that it's a great business. And we think that the future of what these assets can do is significant and a huge opportunity. So nothing about our view on M&A has changed .\nBryan Kraft: Okay. Go ahead, Jessica, sorry.\nJessica Fischer: No. I mean, I will add to that, that obviously, it has to be cable at attractive prices that will be accretive to the shareholders in the long term. So we're -- we are always out there looking for and looking at cable assets, whether they be small cable assets or others. But ultimately, we do think it has to bring value to shareholders. And so we'll be prudent.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPhil Cusick: I wonder if we can go back and talk about the progression of broadband through the quarter, and forgive me if this is just too much. In May, we talked about green shoots. And in mid-June, it looked like broadband would be slightly positive I assume it's fair to say that June was worse than expected and the July is probably not trending well. I'm curious if June being worse is bigger seasonality in that type of market or was it worse in the other markets or the underlying business? And then second, if I can, sort of a big picture question. How much do you take competitive response into account when you price a product like wireless? As you price wireless at $30, Verizon responds with $25 broadband, and it seems to be cycling down, is this really the situation you want to create? And do you think you have an advantage in that over time?\nJessica Fischer: So I'll start on that one. I think what you heard us in May and June, talking about green shoots. We're talking about additional activity, which wasn't necessarily additional additions at that point. And in June, we did still at that point, expect to report total positive Internet adds, even though -- even with the headwind that was associated with the EBB to ACP transition. I don't think that there was a large deterioration in market conditions or performance in June after that time. On a quarterly basis, net adds is an aggregate of more than 1 million connects offset by disconnects. And a very small movement in either side of that equation can lead to sort of small changes in what the ultimate outcome is in net adds, which ultimately 20,000 or 25,000 subscribers is. So I think that our position on where activity has been through the quarter, it's not that different now from where it was before.\nChris Winfrey: I'll start off on the pricing and then I suspect Tom will chime in as well. The -- to build a question on competitive pricing, of course, we think about not only the moves that we're making but the secondary moves and the market responses. And our pricing for mobile is $29.99 when you take through lines or more. It's very simple. There's no taxes and fees. And it's so long as you have or take broadband of really any kind together with that product. Some of the other offers out in the marketplace mean that on a wireless product, you got to go spend $10, $20 more and then you can get discounted prices on broadband. So when you put the all-in package together, our all in package of broadband plus wireless service is dramatically cheaper, taxes and fees included, and no upcharge on the core service required. It's really attractive. So I think even with some of those responses in the marketplace, which may or may not be related to us, we can be very attractive and save customers thousands of dollars a year with a better product, integrated as a converged broadband product for years to come. The other big benefit is that we have the ability to offer mobile in 100% of our footprint. So we have 54 million passings. We have gigabit service everywhere we operate. We did not red line. We're fully upgraded. We have a path to multi-gig symmetrical services. And in addition to that, we have mobile everywhere we operate at a price point that is very, very competitive with a product that's actually not only the fastest-growing mobile but the fastest mobile service in the country. If you put all that together, and we feel pretty good about our competitive positioning long term.\nTom Rutledge: Yes. And to your broader question, yes, we think about what it does to how competitors might price against us. And our view is that we can do the pricing we're doing and still be -- create extremely good value for customers and, at the same time, create an extremely good value for us. And the macro situation with regard to us is that we're underpenetrated. We have 4%, 5% of the mobile dollars in our marketplace. And when you just add up all the telecom spend, we have a very small piece of it. And so our opportunity is volume. You saw that even in the second quarter. So second quarter, seasonal quarter, low volume in the cable side across the entire market. And yet, we still have 344,000 net adds on mobile in a very low cable environment. I think that illustrates the opportunity. When the market comes back, Internet sales will go back up along with the market activity. But mobile in a strange way right now from a line's net adds perspective, it's depressed compared to what it could or should be in a normalized market. So we'll continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Supino with Wolf Research. Your line is now open.\nPeter Supino: Two questions on pricing across two different products. First on mobile, Chris, I particularly appreciate your comments on the cost structure. And I'm aware that mobile has not historically sold at high rates to new broadband subscribers. And in context of a business with flagging gross adds, I wondered if there's an opportunity in the future to attach more mobile to gross adds and use it as a way to stimulate overall sales of your converged connectivity product. And then in parallel, on broadband pricing, I'd love to know your views on retail price increases at this point.\nChris Winfrey: So nothing to announce today, Peter, but clearly, we think a lot about mobile and its ability not only to attach to existing Internet customers, which has been the predominant path so far. But as the market understands better our product, the fact that it is the fastest mobile product in the country and that it's real, that it really does save customers a lot of money, no contracts, no taxes, no fees, I do think there's a really powerful case that we can use to have mobile actually drive significant Internet net adds and particularly in the market with low volume to be able to kick start in volume in the marketplace by using mobile to do just that. So we're constantly testing different concepts in the marketplace. Economically, it's a no-brainer and it makes a lot of sense, but it is a new package structure for educating customers to get them to think about buying a household service and an individual service together so that they can get those savings and they can get that better product, and that may take a little bit of time for us to find the right connection as well as to educate the marketplace. And then the second question, I should have made a note what the second question was on.\nJessica Fischer: Retail pricing.\nChris Winfrey: Retail pricing for broadband?\nJessica Fischer: [Indiscernible] yes.\nChris Winfrey: Our goal has always been to have the best pricing in the marketplace and to the extent that we can withstand some of the inflationary pressures and save customers lots of money with that converged product, which includes both Internet as well as mobile, that's going to be our path. It doesn't mean that we're dogmatic about never taking rate increases when we need to. And so that issue is always available, but our preference has always been to be competitive and value leader in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKutgun Maral: A big picture one on broadband. The magnitude of the slowdown in subscriber growth has been fairly meaningful. A lot of the factors like low market activity, comping the pandemic pull forward and competition are pretty well understood at this point. I know there's been an expectation that we'll get some normalization or stabilization with at least some of these issues, but it's just taking a bit longer than we would have hoped for. So I guess with that, is there a sense of greater urgency to reaccelerate that subscriber growth? And based on answer earlier, it seems like you're satisfied with the current retail playbook. But is there a desire to rethink things like accelerating network investments, the rural build leaning even more into mobile or anything else? Or is the view that the long-term opportunity remains intact and we just need to the course and cycle through the current dynamics?\nChris Winfrey: I think both of those statements are correct, which is the long term remains intact, and in theory, we could just wait it out. But I think you heard -- and I actually like the way that you described the entire situation. So the long-term outlook is very good. We could wait it out. That's not what we're doing. We're accelerating everywhere. We're again on rural buildout to add to the growth. We're taking a look at mobile opportunities, which I just mentioned on the prior question to Peter. And we're serious about putting multi-gig symmetrical everywhere we operate. And so I think both barbells of what you described are actually true.\nTom Rutledge: And there's some execution opportunity, too.\nChris Winfrey: Yes.\nTom Rutledge: The pandemic created employment issues for us and operational issues for us that have an impact on our ability to generate orders as well. And so we're aggressively trying to improve our ability to execute.\nChris Winfrey: So if you think about the long term, it ties to that, too. The -- so we have the ability -- Craig asked about broadband and ARPU and RDOF, and I talked about that. We talked about mobile convergence and how that could kick start. The thing that we haven't talked about is the digitization of our service platform really creates a long-term path to not only enhance customer satisfaction the way they interact with us but to reduce our cost to serve per customer relationship in a very material way. And as good as that's been over the past few years, it's really the very tip of the iceberg in terms of what we can do with that over time, which has a double impact of increasing customer satisfaction, letting them deal with us the way that they want to, reducing the number of interactions and service issues, getting in front of impairments before the customer even knows they exist. And when they interact with us the way they want, oftentimes, that's without a physical transaction, which has benefits on both sides, both to the customer as well as to our P&L.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Stefan Anninger. Please go ahead. .\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, everyone, and we will see you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Vijay, can you clarify on your first question a little bit more? I didn't fully understand what you meant by the new first flow. This is Chris. And we're still a net share taker. You're in a Q2 where move activity remains well below pre-pandemic levels, nonpay churn well below pre-pandemic levels. We also saw the return of seasonality in college markets that didn't occur last year. So we expect to see those gross additions come back in August and September. So it was a seasonal Q2 where you had low move nonpay and our lowest to lever voluntary churn when you exclude this EBB impact. And so without that activity, I think what you're asking is if we were in a normalized environment, are we still in that share taker. And the answer is yes. Yes. Craig, on the broadband growth, I'd just add that similar to what we were talking about with Vijay, the market transaction volume eventually is going to pick up. So our Internet net adds will pick up again. We're confident in that. And our recipe for broadband growth has always been about being competitive and price competitive in the marketplace. And we've had new entrants and overbuild for many, many years. So when you asked the question about ARPU, I assume it relates a little bit to competitive.

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. Our business continues to grow despite an unusual macroeconomic environment. During the second quarter, we added 38,000 Internet customers when excluding an unfavorable impact related to the discontinuation of the emergency broadband benefit, EBB, program and additional definitional requirements of the affordable connectivity program. Customer relationship is churn remains historically low due to current consumer behaviour and connect activity remains low primarily due to the low activity environment. At the same time, we continue to see very strong mobile line growth with line net additions of approximately 350,000. And over the last year, we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4.3 million total mobile lines. Financials were also strong in the second quarter. Second quarter revenue grew by 6.2%, and EBITDA grew by 9.7%. Looking forward, we remain well positioned. Our fixed and mobile broadband service continues to converge technically and operationally. We offer them along with all of our other high-quality products at attractive prices. Our growth is driven by offering value-rich packages that differentiate us from our competition at prices customers can afford regardless of the economic environment. And we plan to continue to do that. To continue to improve our service, we are focused on evolving our network. Data usage continues to grow at a very fast pace. During the second quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us used over 650 gigabytes per month. Nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. And even with the rise of work from home, peak usage patterns still prevail, but the vast majority of data usage occurring during the evening hours. Our network is built to handle that peak demand and delivers consistent speeds regardless of the time of day. With our dense HFC network, we deliver gigabit speeds today everywhere we offer service. And in the near term, we're implementing spectrum split upgrades, which expand our plant capacity and allocate more bandwidth to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we'll be able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds in the downstream. Our long-term network evolution path includes DOCSIS 4.0. Recent testing using DOCSIS 4.0 technology simultaneously delivered over 8 gigabits in the downstream and over 6 gigabits in the upstream in a 4 amplifier cascade to a single mode. We will develop this technology even further, but the test demonstrated that we can successfully drive bidirectional multi-gigabit speed offerings across our entire network in a very capital-efficient manner and without the major disruption to our customers and operations that other kinds of upgrades require. So we can deliver a future-proof network that delivers the most compelling connectivity services in a capital and time-efficient manner and, in turn, offer those services to consumers at highly attractive prices. But we're not only working to improve speeds and latency in our network. We're also working to improve network quality and reliability, reducing service transactions driving longer customer lives and reducing churn. We're doing that through better maintenance practices, using artificial intelligence, telemetry and machine learning technologies to drive what we call operational intelligence. We're now able to ingest, aggregate, correlate and analyze millions of data points from our network, offering us intelligence about the health of our network, services and anomalies in our network that are critical to the customer experience. In the past, this type of real-time network intelligence did not exist, and substantial human effort and manual analysis were required to manage our network, which was time-consuming and brought only limited insights and required thousands of service transactions. In many cases, our intelligence now allows us to avoid network outages and disruptions altogether, maintaining the plant more efficiently with far less activity and cost and fewer outages in service transactions. Our mobile business is growing at an extremely rapid pace. We remain the fastest-growing mobile provider in the nation, and we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offerings, helping to drive customer growth and making our mobile business economics, which are good, even better. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're able to offer consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, we capture less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offerings, we can do that, which, in turn, raises connects, reduces churn and drives overall customer relationship growth. In addition, our mobile business will drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter, even at our existing and very attractive mobile price points, giving us EBITDA growth simply by growing our mobile customer base. We're underpenetrated, and our opportunity is large. Charter remains uniquely positioned to deliver superior services at superior prices, offering consumers the most attractive products for their connectivity needs. Our services remain the best choice for consumers, giving us the opportunity to continue to grow our business at a very healthy pace.  Now I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Sure. I'll start there. Look, there's always a tension between how you price a product and how much of it you drive into the marketplace. And the difference between price and volume -- and price and the volume you get ultimately is -- what you're trying to get to is the maximum amount of cash flow that you can generate out of the business based at the right price and the right volume distribution of that product at that price. . So that's what we're seeking in mobile, and we think it's a huge opportunity for us. It's -- obviously, we're creating customer relationships. Those customers are paying us. There's good margin in that business and at the pricing that we have. And we think that we can get more efficient through time with that margin by offload. And at the same time, we think we're accretive to our MVNO partner and that the 9 million customers that have been created out of that MVNO are accretive and valuable, too, and should be really counted as customers in many ways to our MVNO partner. But that's a shared relationship and -- but the net of all of that is that we have an opportunity at the pricing that we have to continue to grow the business, and that pricing is really valuable relative to the price in the marketplace that those products are currently being offered by our competitors. And at the prices we're offering it now, we have an opportunity to create great value for us through time and to have an improving margin through time as well. But even without an improving margin, it's still a great value. So we're in a pretty good place in terms of our mobile business in that we have lots of opportunity. We have a fully penetrated marketplace, and we have a very small share of it, and we're growing rapidly. With regard to the overall competitive environment, our churn and -- is extremely low. And activity levels in the marketplace are the biggest competitive our biggest impact on our growth rates relative to historic growth rates. The fiber competition that we have is typical. If you go back to the second quarter of 2019 and look at fiber growth, it's not much different, although the footprint's bigger. And there is a new fixed wireless competitor. It's actually relatively small. It's not the major component of our quarterly performance, but it is a factor. If you look at the numbers that the fixed wireless competitors say they're taking from cable and proportionately look at that across our footprint, if you do the math, it's not the major driver of the change in second quarter '19 versus second quarter of 2022. What's -- the major driver is the activity levels. But also, there are other factors that are -- RDOF construction is beginning to ramp up. So that's an opportunity for us. Housing occupancy and new construction is lower because of supply chain issues. So that's -- I think we'll get fixed in the -- in time, but it's an issue affecting growth at the moment. And so we're pretty optimistic, relatively speaking, that as the post-pandemic market activity levels return and normalize, that our share of broadband growth will rise. And we're pretty optimistic that our mobile business is highly accretive and a huge opportunity for us going forward. Yes, I think the way I would say what I think you're saying is we're a net share taker when there's a toss-up. And there's more toss-ups in -- when people are moving. And so therefore, our gross adds out of moves is higher than -- of all moves is higher than our disconnect rate of all moves. That's what you're saying. That's our expectation. With regard to downstreams and upstreams, usage is still significant. 14:1 downstream versus upstream. And so from a practical point of view, our products are appropriate. We think, over the longer term, upstream use will continue, but it isn't actually growing faster than the downstream use at the moment. In terms of broadband opportunities in rural areas, we've won about 1. 5 million passing so far in the RDOF program and the various state programs. There's a lot of bids that we have outstanding at the state level. And there's a $42 billion fund coming next year, which is a huge amount of money, which will allow for additional construction, which we hope to bid on and be successful with. We haven't actually begun to offload on the CBRS yet in a commercial way. But it's interesting, our WiFi-first strategy in our mobile relationship with our customers allows significant offload mobile traffic onto the WiFi network. So when you put those two things together, the success we're having in a managed WiFi first environment and the potential success of CBRS, that's what I was saying before. We have a good relationship in our MVNO today with good volume-based pricing and significant margins and an opportunity if we're continuously successful to make that even better by moving some of the traffic onto -- additional traffic on to WiFi and onto our own 5G CBRS network. So it's a good situation that can get a lot better. Our doom and gloom question. Well, okay. In terms of DOCSIS 4.0, -- it hasn't been deployed. Our footprint right now is DOCSIS 3.1 fully. So we have 1 gig everywhere. The DOCSIS 3.1 upgrade opportunity is still significant, meaning we haven't gotten everything out of DOCSIS 3.1 by any means in terms of its full capacity. It can give us multi-gigabit speeds downstream and gigabit symmetrical speeds, upstream. And so it's a quite robust infrastructure that's already been deployed. And the CPE for that has already been deployed. DOCSIS 4.0 is a complete new electronic drop-in and a whole new modulation scheme and so bars new CPE. And it is not being deployed yet, but it's in the lab and the specs have been written, and it's another technology upgrade that will allow us to get to very high speeds without having to replace our network, which means that you can do that in a really capitally efficient way, which means that ultimately, you have pricing opportunities that others don't. And that's the value of DOCSIS 4.0. . With regard to inflation and its impact on macroeconomic forces on us, look, I mean, I think we have access to capital and at good prices. I think that inflation in some ways, particularly if it's temporary, has some market advantages for us. As consumers are stressed, the value of our products become more clear in the consumer's mind. If you look at how much consumers are spending on telecom products and our share of those telecom products and what we can do with pricing for those telecom products, I think a stressed consumer will find our products even more attractive. So I mean, yes, we'll have to deal with costs. But it's interesting when you look at our overall business and look at our cost structures, we're getting more efficient. And our opportunity to serve and our cost to serve continues to improve. And if we drive more customers, that actually improves on a per customer basis. So we can operate in a difficult economic environment, and we can -- and make our products valuable to consumers. So I'm -- I'd rather operate in a normal environment, but I think we have pretty good assets and pretty good opportunities to be successful. I do think video would be more challenged in a downturn or an inflationary environment than other products, but the margins are relatively -- have become smaller in that part of our business. So the net of it all is, I think it's somewhat of a market opportunity, but it's -- there will be stress on video. Yes, it could get better. And it probably will. That would be our expectation and our experience with these kind of platforms. On volume, yes. . And just one other comment on wireless and its impact, just we are a wireless company. And we have 450 million wireless devices connected to our network -- which is when you -- so you think about -- and when you think about our new video strategy, our new joint venture with Sumo and our ability to connect video customers in the future wirelessly, all of our products would be wirelessly delivered. Well, we've always said we love cable, which is why we've been buying our own stock back because we haven't been able to buy cable. And that it's a great business. And we think that the future of what these assets can do is significant and a huge opportunity. So nothing about our view on M&A has changed . Yes. And to your broader question, yes, we think about what it does to how competitors might price against us. And our view is that we can do the pricing we're doing and still be -- create extremely good value for customers and, at the same time, create an extremely good value for us. And the macro situation with regard to us is that we're underpenetrated. We have 4%, 5% of the mobile dollars in our marketplace. And when you just add up all the telecom spend, we have a very small piece of it. And so our opportunity is volume. You saw that even in the second quarter. So second quarter, seasonal quarter, low volume in the cable side across the entire market. And yet, we still have 344,000 net adds on mobile in a very low cable environment. I think that illustrates the opportunity. When the market comes back, Internet sales will go back up along with the market activity. But mobile in a strange way right now from a line's net adds perspective, it's depressed compared to what it could or should be in a normalized market. So we'll continue to grow. And there's some execution opportunity, too. The pandemic created employment issues for us and operational issues for us that have an impact on our ability to generate orders as well. And so we're aggressively trying to improve our ability to execute."

            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Now let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we lost 21,000 Internet customers in the second quarter. As part of the EBB to ACP transition, a small portion of subsidized Internet customers either did not opt to continue their service after the EBB program ended or did not meet the ACP requirements, particularly the requirement that customers use their service in each 30-day period, which covers the vast majority of the impacted subscribers. This resulted in 59,000 customer disconnects during the quarter. Excluding that headwind, we organically grew 38,000 Internet customers in the quarter. Looking forward, we expect that zero usage ACP customers will have a smaller impact in our quarterly results than what we saw this quarter. Looking at the broader marketplace, while we saw seasonal increases in moves typical of the second quarter, moves remained well below pre-COVID levels. And voluntary churn, when excluding the EBB-ACP impact I mentioned, was even lower than last year, all of which reduced our selling opportunities. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 226,000 in the second quarter, following a programming pass-through increase. Wireline voice declined by $266,000, and we added 344,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from our reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality, attractively priced service. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, we grew total residential customers by $282,000 or 1%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 2.8% year-over-year driven by promotional rate step-ups and earlier video rate adjustments versus last year that pass-through program rerate increases. These effects were partly offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of nonvideo customers and a higher mix of lower-priced video packages within our base. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 4.5% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 3.7%. Enterprise revenue was up by 4.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 8.2%, and enterprise PSUs grew by 4.7% year-over-year. Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 12% year-over-year. That growth came primarily from political. It was slightly offset by a 1% decline in our core advertising business due to lower local and national advertising revenue, including auto, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $726 million with $299 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 8% -- 8. 8% year-over-year and includes rural construction initiatives subsidies totaling $29 million. In total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 6.2% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In 2Q, total operating expenses grew by $307 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.2% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 3.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, all of which was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Looking at the full year 2022, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 10.3% primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs and lower video CPE sold to customers. The decline in Lakers and RSN costs was primarily driven by the delayed start of the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges in 2Q '21, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 4.7%. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021 primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given an abnormal Lakers game schedule last year. Cost to service customers increased by 5.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt year-over-year given lower bad debt in the second quarter of 2021, which benefited from government stimulus packages at the time. And while this quarter's nonpaid churn and bad debt write-offs both remain well below pre-COVID levels, our bad debt accrual includes expectations for potential softening of consumer finances later this year. Excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.1% primarily due to a larger customer base and higher fuel costs partly offset by productivity improvements. As the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive slower growth in cost to service customers expense during the second half of the year. Marketing expenses grew by 8.6% year-over-year due to higher labor costs driven by previously planned wage increases and higher staffing levels as Charter completes the insourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we continue to expect marketing expense to grow in the mid-single-digit percentage range versus 2021. Mobile expenses totaled $797 million and were comprised of mobile device costs tied to device revenue. Customer acquisition and service and operating costs and other expenses increased by 1.3%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 9.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Just a quick note on inflation before moving on to net income. We've seen some inflationary pressure in fuel, freight and utilities as well as pricing pressure on CPE and other network components. In labor, our planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage blunted the impact, but we still see pressure in the labor market, which we may need to more fully respond to as the year progresses. I would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure. But given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe that we're well positioned for this environment. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.5 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter versus $1 billion last year. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion in the second quarter above last year's second quarter spend of $1.9 billion. We spent a total of $357 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that then relates to design, walk out and make ready, and as expected, has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extensions. We spent $95 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and scalable infrastructure and was driven by investments in back-office systems and wireless offload construction. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.7 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $2.1 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher cash tax payments and higher CapEx mostly driven by our rural construction initiatives. We finished the quarter with $95.7 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.5 billion. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8.3 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $4.3 billion at an average price of $511 per share. And given where the share price has been, during the first two quarters of this year, we repurchased 7.2% of our fully diluted shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021, for approximately $7.8 billion. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. The thing that I would add to that, we've been big proponents on the affordability side. And as part of that, we are a larger participant in the affordable connectivity program than many of the other -- well, to the best of our knowledge, all of the other wireline providers. And we've done a lot to try to push the program to our existing subscribers so not as an acquisition program that is a way to alleviate some of the stress on the consumer while it's in our customer base. And I think that, that also puts us in a better position than we would have been in 2008 to retain customers and to do so by providing value to them in a more challenged environment or where the wallet is more challenged. . Doug, I think the point of the example around 4 amplifiers is that the technology can work in an amplifier cascade that would allow it to cover a large portion of our network without having to move the nodes closer to the customers necessarily. So I think it's performance in that environment in the lab at this point is a strong example of how it is that we can make it capital efficient when we deploy it down the road. . It could get better. Volume in June-July. No. I mean, I will add to that, that obviously, it has to be cable at attractive prices that will be accretive to the shareholders in the long term. So we're -- we are always out there looking for and looking at cable assets, whether they be small cable assets or others. But ultimately, we do think it has to bring value to shareholders. And so we'll be prudent. So I'll start on that one. I think what you heard us in May and June, talking about green shoots. We're talking about additional activity, which wasn't necessarily additional additions at that point. And in June, we did still at that point, expect to report total positive Internet adds, even though -- even with the headwind that was associated with the EBB to ACP transition. I don't think that there was a large deterioration in market conditions or performance in June after that time. On a quarterly basis, net adds is an aggregate of more than 1 million connects offset by disconnects. And a very small movement in either side of that equation can lead to sort of small changes in what the ultimate outcome is in net adds, which ultimately 20,000 or 25,000 subscribers is. So I think that our position on where activity has been through the quarter, it's not that different now from where it was before. Retail pricing. [Indiscernible] yes."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Charter's First Quarter 2022 Investor Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I will now hand the conference over to your first speaker today Stefan Anninger. Sir you may begin\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter's First Quarter 2022 Investor Call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website ir.charter.com under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future During the course of today's call we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures as defined by Charter may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today's call, we have Tom Rutledge, Chairman and CEO; Chris Winfrey our COO; and Jessica Fischer our CFO. With that let's turn the call over to Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thank you, Stefan. We continue to grow our business by offering superior converged connectivity products. During the quarter, we added 129,000 customer relationships and 185000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains low due to current consumer behavior while connect activity opportunities also remain low as a result. We continue to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 373,000. Over the last year we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4 million total mobile lines Financials were also strong in the first quarter. First quarter revenue and EBITDA each grew by 5.4%. And when excluding a one-time payment free cash flow grew by 9% year-over-year. As always we remain focused on our primary goal of driving customer growth and market share leading to higher free cash flow. We're doing that in a number of ways including, expanding our footprint with good returns on investment, upgrading our network to ensure that we're offering our latest and fastest high-quality connectivity services and continuing to invest in high-quality customer service and finally investing in the mobile business to drive convergence of fixed and mobile connectivity products and earn a higher share of monthly household communication spend by saving customers money. Our rural construction initiative is also progressing as planned and we've started to work in all 24 of the states where we won Rural Digital Opportunity Fund bids. Our multiyear multibillion-dollar rural construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country. Through RDOF, we'll add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next five or so years. And our construction is not limited to RDOF commitments. We continue to build in other rural areas and are pursuing opportunities to receive other broadband stimulus funds. In addition, we regularly expand our network to additional residential SMB and enterprise passing, wherever it's economically attractive. Ultimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but its also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth by growing customers in un-served and underserved areas. Demand for our customers for greater connectivity speeds and data throughput continue to grow at a very fast pace. During the quarter, Internet customers, who did not buy traditional video from us used approximately 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. To meet that growing demand, we're both expanding the capacity and reallocating capacity within our network. And the technology to both expand and reallocate plant bandwidth is developing rapidly. Today, we're implementing high splits of what we prefer to call spectrum splits, which allocate more plant capacity to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we're able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds. Additionally, by expanding and reallocating plant capacity, we reduced our network augmentation capital spending, including no split spending going forward. And the vast majority of our deployed modems are already spectrum split-capable, allowing us to provide faster service to our existing customers, without swapping out their CPE. We've been increasing the number of spectrum split projects in our service areas and we'll continue to do so. And as the technology develops further, we'll shift our strategy dynamically to further expand the capacity of our plant and reallocate bandwidth as necessary to meet customer needs by deploying additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0, which will allow us to deliver even greater capacity offering consumers the fastest and lowest latency connectivity products in a highly capital-efficient way, driving customer and market share growth and free cash flow. In mobile, we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offering helping to drive customer growth, and improving mobile business economics. In April, we began the market rollout of mobile speed boost. Mobile speed boost allows Spectrum Mobile customers to receive speeds up to one gigabit per second on their Spectrum Mobile service devices, when inside their homes even when their provisioned wireline Internet speed is less than a gigabit. The rollout of our first trial of our CBS small cells in full market area continues to progress nicely. In the first quarter, we completed the build-out of our mobile core network for the upcoming trial. We expect the trial to begin in the middle of next year and to offer faster speeds, a better all mobile experience, all the while saving us costs. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're offering to consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package, while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars per year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, we capture well less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offering, we can do that, which in turn raises connects, reduces churn and drives customer growth. Before turning the call over to Jessica, I wanted to make a few comments about the joint venture with Comcast that we announced earlier this week. Our joint venture will provide video, delivered by apps, a competitive app store, on-TV applications and is capable of aggregation, navigation, search and curation, billing and content security. It will give consumers new devices and content providers new opportunities to create customer relationships on a platform designed to help them sell video effectively. Comcast has created excellent IP for this venture and we have high expectations that we can work together to continue its development and distribution. We have a history of success in our mobile JV operating systems, demonstrated by the fact that between our two respective mobile businesses we added more mobile lines in the first quarter of this year than the rest of the mobile industry added collectively. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Tom. Let's now turn to our customer results on slide five. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 129,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customer relationships by 185,000 in the quarter. We continue to see record low combined competitive and move churn, which has reduced our selling opportunities and very low non-pay churn across our footprint. Similar to the fourth quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the first quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. And this was true across our footprint regardless of computing technology. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 112,000 in the first quarter. Wireline voice declined by 150,000 and we added 373,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality attractively priced service. Moving to financial results starting on slide six. Over the last year we grew total residential customers by 674,000 or 2.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1% year-over-year, driven by promotional rate step-ups and video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases. These effects were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of low-priced video packages within our base. Additionally, this quarter's revenue was negatively impacted by $20 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video consumers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter, with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the impact of sports network credit I just mentioned, our residential ARPU grew by 1.2% year-over-year. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue or video programming pass-through increases announced late in the first quarter. As slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year and by 3.9% year-over-year, when excluding the sports network credit. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 4.6% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 4.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.5% and enterprise PSUs grew by 5.2% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue grew by 11.5% year-over-year or by 5.1% excluding political revenue, primarily due to our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $690 million with $292 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 5.2% year-over-year and includes two months of rural construction initiative subsidies totaling $19 million. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 5.4% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $410 million or 5.4% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.4% year-over-year, due to a decline in video customers of 2.1%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $20 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned and $34 million of other favorable adjustments, much of which was not unique year-over-year. All of that was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.4%. And looking at the full year 2022, we now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid single-digit percentage range versus mid single-digits previously. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 7.4%, primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs, lower video CPE sold to customers and lower regulatory and franchise fees. The decline in Lakers costs was primarily driven by the delayed start to the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges into Q1 of 2021, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 5.6%. And for the full year 2022, we expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2021, primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given the abnormal Lakers game scheduled last year. Cost to service customers increased by 5.3% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt given unusually low bad debt in the first quarter of 2021 when bad debt was down $100 million versus the first quarter of 2020, benefiting from the government stimulus packages. In fact, payment trends in the first quarter continue to be very good. And excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.8%, primarily due to a larger customer base, previously planned wage increases to $20 per hour starting wage, for hourly field operations and call center employees and higher health benefit and fuel costs. As the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive meaningfully slower growth in cost to service expense line during the second half of the year. Marketing expenses grew by 10.1% year-over-year due to higher labor costs, driven by previously planned wage increases and temporarily greater staffing levels, as Charter completes the in-sourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we expect marketing expense to grow in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2021, although marketing expense growth is likely to remain at elevated levels in the second quarter. Mobile expense totaled $760 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 12.5%, primarily driven by a favorable non-recurring adjustment in the prior year period making for a challenging comparison this year and higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.4% year-over-year in the quarter. A quick note about inflation before moving on to net income. Certain costs of operating our business such as labor and fuel costs are currently subject to inflationary pressure. But given our previously planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage and our long-term relationships and contracts for goods and services, we haven't yet seen a significant impact on inflation in our P&L. I would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure but given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe we are well positioned for the changing market. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $800 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by a non-recurring litigation settlement charge in other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter just above last year's first quarter spend of $1.8 billion. We spent a total of $232 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that spend relates to design, walk out and make ready and as expected has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extension. We spent $74 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems. As Slide 10 shows,, we generated $1.8 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, a decrease of $55 million or 3% year-over-year. Excluding a one-time litigation payment of $220 million made in the first quarter free cash flow grew by $165 million or 8.9% year-over-year. Please note that in the second quarter we'll begin making quarterly cash tax payments for fiscal year 2022. These payments are consistent with the cash tax outlook that we provided in our fourth quarter investor call. We finished the quarter with $94.9 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.43 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased six million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $3.6 billion at an average purchase price of $600 per share. And since September of 2016, we've repurchased $60.4 billion or nearly 42% of Charter's equity. Our path to continue to grow our business remains strong and we will do that by furthering convergence in our connectivity business allowing us to capture additional share, focusing on expanding our footprint and by continuing to improve the customer experience and extending customer lives. By executing on those items we will drive customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will come from Craig Moffett with Moffett. Your line is open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Well, I have a few questions, if I could. First, with respect to broadband the pace of homes passed excluding RDOF decelerated a little bit. I'm wondering, if you can just talk about, the rate at which you expect homes passed for broadband to grow and how you think about that as a floor for broadband growth rate going forward? And then with respect to the JV that you announced with Comcast, is there a vision where you take the Flex box and actually make it your primary video delivery platform, where all your video is IP and that you sort of reclaim that capacity? And then finally, one related question Tom. I sort of \u2013 I can't resist asking if you just want to comment on password sharing, and a little bit of an I told you so.\nTom Rutledge: Yeah. Well, yeah, I did tell you so. So yeah, Craig, the pace of broadband homes passed, I think is an interesting driver of potential growth. And you're right to point it out. Over the last five years or so we've added about one million passing's a year. And that's comprised of new construction of housing developments plus fill-in, plus plant expansion into areas where it's economic to serve passing's that are contiguous to some of that development. And so that's a driver of future growth. There's really four drivers that drive the future growth of our broadband business, and that's a significant one. Another one is the household in growth \u2013 the growth in households using broadband, which is today in the mid-80s. But I think that will continue to increase as digital literacy increases and people continue to want to be part of the connected world. And so I think that moves up to the vacancy rate over time. And we also have then this whole RDOF opportunity, which we've just begun to develop. We've just started to activate the subsidized plant expansion through RDOF. And we've actually won quite a few bids at the state level. And there's $42 billion of additional funding that's going to be distributed probably next year for additional expansion into rural areas and that's an opportunity of growth for us. And then finally, we have the opportunity of \u2013 which we expect to realize the opportunity of increasing our share of market of existing broadband customers. And we can do that by packaging, which we've always done successfully, our products and into a value proposition that's better than what the individual component pieces that they're currently buying from various providers. And so the current mobile growth is a key factor in that opportunity. So that's how we expect to grow it. And what's going on in the homes passed marketplace? I mean there are construction issues going on right now. There are supply chain issues that are affecting activations of housing developments and that kind of thing. But over the longer term, I think that that pace that we've experienced over the last five years continues. The second part of your question about the JV and IP, yeah, yeah. The answer is yes. I expect that incrementally most of our customer base will be all IP and that Spectrum will be recaptured. And that's currently used over time and there's various ways of compressing that Spectrum as you market your way into the IP space. And that plant capacity that's being realized will be available to increase broadband speeds and/or handle broadband capacity that's required as a result of the use of overall data. And lastly on password sharing, yeah. We knew it's a problem. It's not just a problem for the company that's not controlling their passwords, but it's a problem for everybody in the industry because all that content that's used without anybody paying for it affects the supply and demand of all content, not just the provider that's selling the content, which diminishes the value of content for everybody, which is the point we have been trying to make for years. So, next question?\nStefan Anninger: We will take our next question. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I know traditionally you prefer not to give context around sort of like a forward-looking view of the broadband market. But given that we're just in an environment of heightened uncertainty, I'm wondering if you'd stray from your normal policy and at least give us some more context for what you're seeing from -- in the market generally in terms of the move activity as we came out of 1Q into 2Q. Competition, are you seeing an impact now that's more discernible from fixed wireless broadband? And has that changed over the course of the quarter going into 2Q? And then how should we think about seasonality off of the results that you guys just produced in 1Q, should we think of seasonality through the year as being the normal trend? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Look Chris why don't you take that?\nChris Winfrey: Hey, Jonathan, we expected a question along these lines and I have some thoughts. We expected the market to return to normal actually last year including seasonality. So difficult to say. But as Jessica mentioned transaction volume in the market, it remains low particularly move return, which is a key source of net subscriber acquisition for us. There are some facts that put our lower year-over-year growth in context. Our churn rates of all kinds and across all footprint types remains at record lows. The pace of gigabit overlap increases within our footprint, so far has remained consistent with the past few years, despite commentary about acceleration. So we have competition everywhere we operate, and we always have. And our largest wireline competitor had negative residential wireline net additions in the quarter, where we continue to grow. So compared to last year's first quarter with already low market activity, our gross addition rate in the first quarter of this year was lower in both overbuild and our non-overbuild footprint by the same amount. Together with record low churn, this illustrates the biggest driver remains lower selling opportunities from overall market activity and churn. Jonathan, there are additional factors which could also contribute to lower gross addition rates. First, lower household growth rates, Tom just talked about, which we along with others have seen. There's still a lingering pull-forward effect from the shift to our higher-quality broadband during the pandemic. It comes from DSL, VDSL and mobile-only customers, which accelerated the conversion rates of that same base, which we would have seen today. Finally, the mix-related impact of a small increase and more competitive overlap on gross addition rates would be the smallest contributor, and really no different than what we've seen in the prior years. We do not see -- I know, it's a question. We don't see direct impacts from fixed wireless access in our churn or our gross additions. So does that mean could fix wireless access be converting DSL and mobile-only customers that would normally come to us? It's possible and it would be hard to see it load volume across our entire footprint. But we would see that as a potential parking lot for conversion to our faster, more reliable and more ubiquitously marketed and deployed broadband offering. So we take all competition seriously and it's not new for us. But I don't believe fixed wireless access is having any material impact on us today when compared to the factors I mentioned. So, overall activity levels remain low, and we will trial different tactics to stimulate more competitive churn, but market activity and move return will return. And when it does, we expect our Internet net addition rate to normalize. Our already very strong mobile line growth should get even better with higher attach and upgrade rates to the fastest and really the only real converged Internet product in our footprint that also saves customers significant money. As Tom mentioned, our various construction initiatives should provide a larger recurring footprint expansion for customer acquisition, as we get to the end of this year. So I don't have a guidance or an outlook. But I think those are the biggest drivers of what we're seeing today and hopefully that's helpful to the question you asked. \nJonathan Chaplin: That's really helpful. I appreciate it, Chris. \nChris Winfrey: Yes. \nStefan Anninger : Thanks Jonathan. Peter, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. You've obviously continued to show great traction with the wireless net adds even as your selling opportunity against customer gross adds has gone down. So it looks like the recent adjustments you've made to pricing and packaging is resonating with the base. You're still going to market differently than the big three. They increasingly are looking at things like handset promos, they tack a lot of value into their higher tiers, whether it's tethering or true unlimited or video. So I guess I'm just wondering, how are you thinking about whether it makes sense to start going after the wireless consumer who values those things and the assessment you're doing as to whether the additional costs you incur would ultimately be worth it? And does that math start to change if you were at the point where you actually were putting a more significant amount of their macro traffic onto a CBRS network? Thank you.\nTom Rutledge : Yes. Well, I think the -- Brett the answer to your question is we will use those tactics that make economic sense to us to drive our business and to drive our relationship growth in this mobile broadband space. And the -- as I said in my comments we have very good growth and we have greater growth than the rest of the mobile industry currently. So, we're on track and doing the right things currently from a marketing perspective and we think we can accelerate that growth. So, there are various tactics that you see people who sell wireless do and they're all related to trying to create a value proposition for customers and some of them cost more than others. Fundamentally, we think that our CBRS and our WiFi offload continue to allow us to have low-cost mobile products with high capacity available to our customers which gives us the ability to sell those products at value propositions for consumers, which ultimately is what we think drives our ability to shift -- drive market share. So we -- I don't put any marketing tactic on the side and say we won't do it or because we're not doing it today we won't do it in the future. But our fundamental strategy is to use our network effectively and provide a high-quality best-in-class service better than anyone else in fact right now in terms of speed capability and sell that for a lower price. And we think that that value is what consumers will ultimately recognize. How we package that up in various marketing tactics I think is open to what is successful. And we constantly experiment with marketing tactics to see what resonates best. But we think the core concept is the driver of our opportunity.\nChris Winfrey: Brett a good example of that we do -- we have a premium plus $10 package in our mobile. So, even that at $39.99, so our standard is $29.99 when you take two mobiles or more. But at $39.99 the impact the take up on is very low. And the reason it's very low is for the reason that Tom just mentioned. Already they get the fastest mobile product in the country through the standard limited offer that we have at $29.99. And because our network works better together with WiFi and you've got 85% offload with the nation's fastest broadband and therefore the nation's fastest mobile there really hasn't been much of a need or a desire even at that attractive price point to take what you would call a premium product.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Peter, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hi guys. Thanks. A couple if I can. First I think Tom you said the mobile network trial is now in mid-2023. Is that right? And is that delayed? And what does that mean for CapEx this year -- for mobile CapEx?\nTom Rutledge: No, it's not -- it's mid this year. If I said that, I didn't mean it. It's mid-2022.\nPhil Cusick: All right. That makes sense. Maybe I misheard. And then second of all have you started to book RDOF revenue? And how quickly should we see that revenue come in from here? \nTom Rutledge: Yes Jess?\nJessica Fischer: Yes, we did start booking RDOF revenue in Q1, Phil. They're two months in for the total of $19 million. And the run rate on the RDOF booking will be at that. So it gets booked in over the 10-year period that we receive the funds. So we'll have it at that just over $9 million a month from now until 10-years from now.\nPhil Cusick: Great. Thanks very much guys.\nStefan Anninger: Peter, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BofA Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Okay. Thank you. I have two questions. A follow-up on the Comcast JV. I think the press release said that you guys are investing $900 million. Over what time period is that? And how do you expect to monetize the offer? I think it starts next year. Is it mostly advertising or revenue split? And then your margins on the cable side are over 42%. Where do you think peak cable margins will be?\nTom Rutledge: Well, the opportunity Jessica is to create advertising revenue and to create transaction revenue on the product. And so those are the money drivers. And that requires obviously having full set of content opportunities and using your IP and your marketing skills in the digital space to drive consumer activity and viewing. And so that's the opportunity from the platform from a monetization perspective. Our capital commitment we haven't disclosed that. But it's in the grand scheme of things from a development point of view it's relatively minor, especially when you consider the CPE business that we've always been in where we've actually had to buy CPE. This in many cases will be a retail product. So -- and lastly\u2026\nJessica Fischer: The last one was a question on margins and where we think\nTom Rutledge: Yeah.\nJessica Fischer: \u2026margins ultimately could go. I mean it's hard to comment on margins in the context of our business because your mix of video product makes such a difference. And ultimately, we're trying to sell the right mix of products to the consumer that drives the most cash flow per customer which doesn't necessarily drive the most margin, on a financial statement presentation sort of basis. So I would say on that one it's hard to speculate on where exactly margins would go as a percentage. But ultimately, we think that what we're doing by capturing additional share in the mobile market, using that and capturing additional share in the broadband market, which drives sort of the most cash flow off of our assets and in our other services as well, we think that that's the right thing to do to drive cash flow for the business and to continue to grow regardless of what the margin line ultimately shows.\nTom Rutledge: Yeah. We don't manage the margins. We managed to return on investment. And so we try to generate as much cash on each asset that we deploy as we can and has really nothing to do with margins when you have a mix of products with different kinds of margins in them. And so it's only in a static environment that a margin relative -- relative margin has any value as an analysis tool in our -- from our point of view.\nChris Winfrey: You can have a really high margin by not growing at all.\nTom Rutledge: Exactly.\nChris Winfrey: That hasn't always worked out for the people.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks, Jessica. Peter, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. \nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. I think a few more questions around broadband if you don't mind. The first is how many DSL customers are left in your footprint? And what do you think the broadband penetration is overall in your footprint? How much is left to go from just more folks getting broadband? And a couple of follow-ups.\nChris Winfrey: Hey, Doug, this is Chris. Look for competitive reasons I don't want to go deep into the remaining broadband penetration. People have statistics. They know what's out there. There's still a sizable opportunity for us to grow the market which Tom talked about. And in terms of DSL, it's declining but there's still a decent base. You really need to think about not just DSL but really the VDSL. That's really the new DSL. I talked a little bit about to the extent that fixed wireless access is building up potentially in the areas that we're moving into from a rural perspective, that's in the future DSL pile or parking lot of subscribers that we can go acquire. So it's DSL today, it's VDSL and it's inferior broadband product relationships that are getting created today that provides that fuel for growth for us in the future from a mix standpoint.\nDoug Mitchelson: And Chris you mentioned I think relative to gross additions no difference in competitive fiber footprints versus non-competitive fiber footprints. Is it the same for churn as well? I just wanted to confirm that sort of year-over-year churn changes are no different in the two footprints.\nChris Winfrey: Yes we see churn down in both types of footprints at a similar amount and we see the almost \u2013 well not almost the exact same reduction in gross addition rate in both overbuild and non-overbuild footprint, which really completely validates that this isn't a competitive phenomenon that you see in the marketplace. It's the market activity a low-mover churn environment. And we're stimulating in a lot of different ways and some of that will have some success but the bigger driver will just be when the market starts to normalize. So yes, you understood it correctly.\nTom Rutledge: But another part of your question was what's the overall broadband penetration. And if you take all those smaller speeds slow speed products, it's in the mid-80s. And as I said earlier I think that goes up towards the vacancy rate.\nDoug Mitchelson: Great. Thank you. And the last question I wanted to get to and I appreciate you taking the questions. Competitors have a variety of pricing and go-to-market strategies for broadband and mobile. And you actually have I think a difference yourself on how you would build a broadband customer and how you might build a wireless customer. I think wireless no contracts and no taxes or fees. How are you thinking about evolving your pricing strategies if at all either in response to competitors or because you're finding more optimal ways to serve your customers? \nTom Rutledge: Like I was speaking about marketing earlier that's a form of price. We have lots of opportunity to mix and match various tactics to create value for customers perceived value. But fundamental value is where we're really trying to drive our product, which is having superior products at lower prices than our competitors by doing smart investments and good technologies that allow us to have a lower cost structure and have a lower cost per bit so to speak available to consumers both in the mobile space and in the broadband space and in the video space to the extent it's a separate business. And we can mix and match those value propositions in a variety of ways depending on what we need to do to move customer perceptions about where the true value is in the product set.\nDoug Mitchelson: All right. Understood. Thank you, all.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Doug. Peter, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Thanks.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. I had one sort of big question about the video business. Obviously, your video losses seem to buck the trend relative to some of your peers. Can you just talk about how much flex is left on these lower-tier offers that you can still put out to customers? And any changes to sort of carriage minimums as you renegotiate programming deals? And then just for Jessica, you called out a lot of trends on the cost side. I just wanted to ask some questions on them. On bad debt are we back to the pre-pandemic levels? And then just on CapEx. Obviously, you talked about core for cable, should we assume RDOF CapEx sort of trend similar to this quarter in the low 200s a quarter just for modeling purposes? Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Jessica, you want answer the bad debt question?\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. So if I start on the expense items Vijay, the bad debt we're not back to pre-pandemic levels. I don't expect us actually to go all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. The subsidies for broadband that are available in the market have eased the impact on consumers of sort of what happens in the economy and just made it easier to pay for services overall. And they are targeted, obviously, those consumers who are more prone to go non-pay in the first place. So non-pay churn overall continues to be at near-record lows. And I think that, right now we haven't seen yet sort of moves back towards pre-pandemic levels. On the RDOF side, I think that spend in the rural construction initiative overall, I wouldn't expect it to sort of trend at a very steady level over time. There will be opportunities that we have to accelerate spend at points in time and as we have those opportunities, because we think that continuing the build is important, we likely will take them. I think we've accelerated right now some of the kind of spend that I talked about happening in this quarter the design and make-ready type expenses. We're trying to pull those forward, so that we can be ready to deploy as quickly as possible sort of to deploy more going into next year. It's \u2013 that's not a change in guide sort of on where we think we're going for overall. But I think as I said, when we issued \u2013 when we talked about the $1 billion that we hoped to spend for the year, we could spend more or we could spend less than that. And it's all based on what we're able to do. We're going as fast as we can.\nTom Rutledge: And with regard to video, why we're somewhat of an outlier, we try hard for one thing. And again, we try to put value where we can for the consumer and think that, there's still opportunity in video. And one of the things that we had success with is, the creation of additional packaging and the mix of video products that we actually sell to consumers. And we're continuously improving the right structures around what we're able to sell. And it's been difficult because of the way historically video has been packaged in this very fat expensive bundle that's driven by sports rights costs. And as we've been able to get some of the content out of that, the ecosystem, and put into tiers and we're successfully selling those. And I think over time, we'll be able to build a very nice video business.\nVijay Jayant: Great. Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Vijay. Peter, we\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: And your next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Tom and Chris, I had a couple of related questions around competition in broadband. I think in -- I'm not telling you anything you don't know. I think investor sentiment on cable is probably as poor as it's been since like maybe the mid-2000s when you were getting overbuilt by Fios and U-verse, particularly at Cablevision. Tom, do you see corollaries today to that period when you were running Cablevision and Verizon was building its network across half the footprint and how you compete and sort of navigate that overbuild? And then, one thing that's happening, I'm sure you guys are aware, there's a lot of sort of Tier 2 fiber overbuilds happening around the country. I'm sure there's some in your footprint. They're not massive, but a lot of private equity funded builds. We usually don't see cable companies acquire infrastructure assets in their footprint, at least in the US. I'd just be curious if you think that's long term what happens here, or not, for reasons that might be obvious, because it would seem that there's a lot of capacity being built now on the wireline side. And there will need to be some rationalization, at least in some geographies long term. Thanks for the thoughts.\nTom Rutledge: All right. Well, in terms of sentiment, yes, there have been periods in my business career in cable where sentiment has gone up and down. And my sentiment remains the same. And I think, it's a great business and I think we have great opportunity to take and to continue to grow the business successfully. And so, when everybody's euphoric, it's probably odd. And when everybody is pessimistic, it's odd, and I'm unchanged. And my experiences with Cablevision and other assets, I managed Time Warner assets as well, prior to that, and have managed competition. My first job as a general manager in 1980, was an overbuild, actually. And so, I have lots of experience with it and lots of success in growing our businesses in that environment. So there's nothing unusual about what's going on now. And actually, from a competitive environment, it's pretty much unchanged, the pace of what's been going on, notwithstanding that there are some small builds going on elsewhere with private equity, as you say and that LEC expansion has continued. But it hasn't gone up in pace. So -- and we do quite well, regardless of whether we're in a physical competition with a wireline builder or whether we're in competition with satellites or whether we're in competition with a fixed wireless asset. We're pretty comfortable that we can continue to drive our value proposition and continue to grow our customer relationships. So my sentiment is unchanged. And are there opportunities for us to buy some infrastructure companies that would help us make our network better, because they happen to be in the right place? There probably is.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. I'd add to that Ben. You've seen it as well around for a while. The history of these tertiary overbuilders is pretty demonstrated as well. And my experience is they all start out with a rosy story and they get a lot of capital going in. And the early penetration is, because there's something new and environment starts to look good. And as long as you can sell fast enough you can do okay as a return. But the history is that they all go bankrupt and they end up having to be recapitalized. And so I think there's that repeat that takes place every so often in the marketplace. And so you see some of that. And our job is just put our head down and be competitive like we always have and go dig out customers and continue to develop products pricing and packaging that people can't replicate. So like Tom I'm about as optimistic as you could be about where the business continues to go. \nBen Swinburne: Great. Thank you.\nTom Rutledge: I was optimistic last year and I was optimistic the year before that and still am.\nBen Swinburne: Yes. We're out of consensus now, Tom.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Great. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Ben. Peter, we\u2019ll take our last question, please.\nOperator: Your last question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks, and good morning. Just to follow-up on a couple of things. First, just curious if you could share more of the timetable on the pace of broadband network upgrades for certain percentages of your coverage footprint, when you think of the opportunity to increase upload speeds as well as to expand download speeds? And then secondly, as you consider a number of factors, rate environment, stock price, the company's view of forward growth under what circumstances would you revise the current capital allocation plan and take net debt leverage targets higher or lower? Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: I guess I'll start on the leverage target question. If I think about where we are right now rates have obviously increased versus where they've been in the recent past. In historical context, I think that rates are still quite low. And so maybe not a little bit, but in line with where we'd expect them to be. In the -- from a growth perspective, as you just heard from Tom and Chris I think we continue to be quite optimistic about our growth opportunity. And on the sentiment side, our stock is trading at a multiple to free cash flow even that's just pretty low compared to where we've been. And so I think that we're happy with where we're sitting targeting the high end of our four to 4.5 times leverage ratio. We obviously continue to evaluate over time. It would be hard to sort of break out what scenario exactly would cause us to move off of that space. But I think that we're happy with where we are and we'll continue to target at that level. \nTom Rutledge: And in terms of the pace of upgrades, we're actually doing multiple upgrades in various parts of the country right now. And we're pacing ourselves in such a way that we're learning how to do it really effectively. The interesting thing about our capacity to do these upgrades is that they're quite simple electronic upgrades. They're relatively inexpensive and we can do them rapidly across as much of our footprint as we need to do. And we're just actually putting ourselves in a position right now so that we can execute at the pace we need to execute given where the demand for that kind of capacity will exist. And we haven't really forecasted that publicly in terms of how fast we're going to do that. \nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Mike. And Peter, we're going to pass it back to you. That concludes our call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Hey, Jonathan, we expected a question along these lines and I have some thoughts. We expected the market to return to normal actually last year including seasonality.

So we take all competition seriously and it's not new for us. But I don't believe fixed wireless access is having any material impact on us today when compared to the factors I mentioned. So, overall activity levels remain low, and we will trial different tactics to stimulate more competitive churn, but market activity and move return will return. And when it does, we expect our Internet net addition rate to normalize. Our already very strong mobile line growth should get even better with higher attach and upgrade rates to the fastest and really the only real converged Internet product in our footprint that also saves customers significant money. As Tom mentioned, our various construction initiatives should provide a larger recurring footprint expansion for customer acquisition, as we get to the end of this year. So I don't have a guidance or an outlook. But I think those are the biggest drivers of what we're seeing today and hopefully that's helpful to the question you asked. Yes. Brett a good example of that we do -- we have a premium plus $10 package in our mobile. So, even that at $39.99, so our standard is $29.99 when you take two mobiles or more. But at $39.99 the impact the take up on is very low. And the reason it's very low is for the reason that Tom just mentioned. Already they get the fastest mobile product in the country through the standard limited offer that we have at $29.99. And because our network works better together with WiFi and you've got 85% offload with the nation's fastest broadband and therefore the nation's fastest mobile there really hasn't been much of a need or a desire even at that attractive price point to take what you would call a premium product. You can have a really high margin by not growing at all. That hasn't always worked out for the people. Hey, Doug, this is Chris. Look for competitive reasons I don't want to go deep into the remaining broadband penetration. People have statistics. They know what's out there. There's still a sizable opportunity for us to grow the market which Tom talked about. And in terms of DSL, it's declining but there's still a decent base. You really need to think about not just DSL but really the VDSL. That's really the new DSL. I talked a little bit about to the extent that fixed wireless access is building up potentially in the areas that we're moving into from a rural perspective, that's in the future DSL pile or parking lot of subscribers that we can go acquire. So it's DSL today, it's VDSL and it's inferior broadband product relationships that are getting created today that provides that fuel for growth for us in the future from a mix standpoint. Yes we see churn down in both types of footprints at a similar amount and we see the almost \u2013 well not almost the exact same reduction in gross addition rate in both overbuild and non-overbuild footprint, which really completely validates that this isn't a competitive phenomenon that you see in the marketplace. It's the market activity a low-mover churn environment. And we're stimulating in a lot of different ways and some of that will have some success but the bigger driver will just be when the market starts to normalize. So yes, you understood it correctly. Yes. I'd add to that Ben. You've seen it as well around for a while. The history of these tertiary overbuilders is pretty demonstrated as well. And my experience is they all start out with a rosy story and they get a lot of capital going in. And the early penetration is, because there's something new and environment starts to look good. And as long as you can sell fast enough you can do okay as a return. But the history is that they all go bankrupt and they end up having to be recapitalized. And so I think there's that repeat that takes place every so often in the marketplace. And so you see some of that. And our job is just put our head down and be competitive like we always have and go dig out customers and continue to develop products pricing and packaging that people can't replicate. So like Tom I'm about as optimistic as you could be about where the business continues to go."

            "name": "Tom Rutledge",
            "content": "Thank you, Stefan. We continue to grow our business by offering superior converged connectivity products. During the quarter, we added 129,000 customer relationships and 185000 Internet customers. Customer relationship churn remains low due to current consumer behavior while connect activity opportunities also remain low as a result. We continue to see very strong mobile line growth with net additions of 373,000. Over the last year we've grown our mobile lines by nearly 50%. We now have over 4 million total mobile lines Financials were also strong in the first quarter. First quarter revenue and EBITDA each grew by 5.4%. And when excluding a one-time payment free cash flow grew by 9% year-over-year. As always we remain focused on our primary goal of driving customer growth and market share leading to higher free cash flow. We're doing that in a number of ways including, expanding our footprint with good returns on investment, upgrading our network to ensure that we're offering our latest and fastest high-quality connectivity services and continuing to invest in high-quality customer service and finally investing in the mobile business to drive convergence of fixed and mobile connectivity products and earn a higher share of monthly household communication spend by saving customers money. Our rural construction initiative is also progressing as planned and we've started to work in all 24 of the states where we won Rural Digital Opportunity Fund bids. Our multiyear multibillion-dollar rural construction project will deliver gigabit high-speed broadband access to more than 1 million unserved rural customer locations across the country. Through RDOF, we'll add over 100,000 miles of new network infrastructure to our approximately 800,000 existing miles over the next five or so years. And our construction is not limited to RDOF commitments. We continue to build in other rural areas and are pursuing opportunities to receive other broadband stimulus funds. In addition, we regularly expand our network to additional residential SMB and enterprise passing, wherever it's economically attractive. Ultimately, our rural construction initiative is not only good for the millions of rural customers that will finally have access to fast and reliable Internet, but its also good for Charter and its shareholders. The expansion of our footprint will help us drive additional customer growth by growing customers in un-served and underserved areas. Demand for our customers for greater connectivity speeds and data throughput continue to grow at a very fast pace. During the quarter, Internet customers, who did not buy traditional video from us used approximately 700 gigabytes per month, more than 35% higher than pre-pandemic levels. And nearly 25% of those customers now use a terabyte or more of data per month. To meet that growing demand, we're both expanding the capacity and reallocating capacity within our network. And the technology to both expand and reallocate plant bandwidth is developing rapidly. Today, we're implementing high splits of what we prefer to call spectrum splits, which allocate more plant capacity to the upstream, all using our DOCSIS 3.1 infrastructure. In turn, we're able to offer our customers higher symmetrical speeds and multi-gigabit speeds. Additionally, by expanding and reallocating plant capacity, we reduced our network augmentation capital spending, including no split spending going forward. And the vast majority of our deployed modems are already spectrum split-capable, allowing us to provide faster service to our existing customers, without swapping out their CPE. We've been increasing the number of spectrum split projects in our service areas and we'll continue to do so. And as the technology develops further, we'll shift our strategy dynamically to further expand the capacity of our plant and reallocate bandwidth as necessary to meet customer needs by deploying additional technologies, including DOCSIS 4.0, which will allow us to deliver even greater capacity offering consumers the fastest and lowest latency connectivity products in a highly capital-efficient way, driving customer and market share growth and free cash flow. In mobile, we continue to improve and enhance our products in a number of ways, differentiating our offering helping to drive customer growth, and improving mobile business economics. In April, we began the market rollout of mobile speed boost. Mobile speed boost allows Spectrum Mobile customers to receive speeds up to one gigabit per second on their Spectrum Mobile service devices, when inside their homes even when their provisioned wireline Internet speed is less than a gigabit. The rollout of our first trial of our CBS small cells in full market area continues to progress nicely. In the first quarter, we completed the build-out of our mobile core network for the upcoming trial. We expect the trial to begin in the middle of next year and to offer faster speeds, a better all mobile experience, all the while saving us costs. Ultimately, with our mobile product, we're offering to consumers a unique and superior fully converged connectivity service package, while saving customers hundreds or thousands of dollars per year. And our share of household connectivity spend, including mobile and fixed broadband is still very low. In fact, we capture well less than 30% of household spend on wireline and mobile connectivity within our footprint. So there's a large opportunity for us to increase market share by saving customers money. And through our latest offering, we can do that, which in turn raises connects, reduces churn and drives customer growth. Before turning the call over to Jessica, I wanted to make a few comments about the joint venture with Comcast that we announced earlier this week. Our joint venture will provide video, delivered by apps, a competitive app store, on-TV applications and is capable of aggregation, navigation, search and curation, billing and content security. It will give consumers new devices and content providers new opportunities to create customer relationships on a platform designed to help them sell video effectively. Comcast has created excellent IP for this venture and we have high expectations that we can work together to continue its development and distribution. We have a history of success in our mobile JV operating systems, demonstrated by the fact that between our two respective mobile businesses we added more mobile lines in the first quarter of this year than the rest of the mobile industry added collectively. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Yeah. Well, yeah, I did tell you so. So yeah, Craig, the pace of broadband homes passed, I think is an interesting driver of potential growth. And you're right to point it out. Over the last five years or so we've added about one million passing's a year. And that's comprised of new construction of housing developments plus fill-in, plus plant expansion into areas where it's economic to serve passing's that are contiguous to some of that development. And so that's a driver of future growth. There's really four drivers that drive the future growth of our broadband business, and that's a significant one. Another one is the household in growth \u2013 the growth in households using broadband, which is today in the mid-80s. But I think that will continue to increase as digital literacy increases and people continue to want to be part of the connected world. And so I think that moves up to the vacancy rate over time. And we also have then this whole RDOF opportunity, which we've just begun to develop. We've just started to activate the subsidized plant expansion through RDOF. And we've actually won quite a few bids at the state level. And there's $42 billion of additional funding that's going to be distributed probably next year for additional expansion into rural areas and that's an opportunity of growth for us. And then finally, we have the opportunity of \u2013 which we expect to realize the opportunity of increasing our share of market of existing broadband customers. And we can do that by packaging, which we've always done successfully, our products and into a value proposition that's better than what the individual component pieces that they're currently buying from various providers. And so the current mobile growth is a key factor in that opportunity. So that's how we expect to grow it. And what's going on in the homes passed marketplace? I mean there are construction issues going on right now. There are supply chain issues that are affecting activations of housing developments and that kind of thing. But over the longer term, I think that that pace that we've experienced over the last five years continues. The second part of your question about the JV and IP, yeah, yeah. The answer is yes. I expect that incrementally most of our customer base will be all IP and that Spectrum will be recaptured. And that's currently used over time and there's various ways of compressing that Spectrum as you market your way into the IP space. And that plant capacity that's being realized will be available to increase broadband speeds and/or handle broadband capacity that's required as a result of the use of overall data. And lastly on password sharing, yeah. We knew it's a problem. It's not just a problem for the company that's not controlling their passwords, but it's a problem for everybody in the industry because all that content that's used without anybody paying for it affects the supply and demand of all content, not just the provider that's selling the content, which diminishes the value of content for everybody, which is the point we have been trying to make for years. So, next question? Look Chris why don't you take that? Yes. Well, I think the -- Brett the answer to your question is we will use those tactics that make economic sense to us to drive our business and to drive our relationship growth in this mobile broadband space. And the -- as I said in my comments we have very good growth and we have greater growth than the rest of the mobile industry currently. So, we're on track and doing the right things currently from a marketing perspective and we think we can accelerate that growth. So, there are various tactics that you see people who sell wireless do and they're all related to trying to create a value proposition for customers and some of them cost more than others. Fundamentally, we think that our CBRS and our WiFi offload continue to allow us to have low-cost mobile products with high capacity available to our customers which gives us the ability to sell those products at value propositions for consumers, which ultimately is what we think drives our ability to shift -- drive market share. So we -- I don't put any marketing tactic on the side and say we won't do it or because we're not doing it today we won't do it in the future. But our fundamental strategy is to use our network effectively and provide a high-quality best-in-class service better than anyone else in fact right now in terms of speed capability and sell that for a lower price. And we think that that value is what consumers will ultimately recognize. How we package that up in various marketing tactics I think is open to what is successful. And we constantly experiment with marketing tactics to see what resonates best. But we think the core concept is the driver of our opportunity. No, it's not -- it's mid this year. If I said that, I didn't mean it. It's mid-2022. Yes Jess? Well, the opportunity Jessica is to create advertising revenue and to create transaction revenue on the product. And so those are the money drivers. And that requires obviously having full set of content opportunities and using your IP and your marketing skills in the digital space to drive consumer activity and viewing. And so that's the opportunity from the platform from a monetization perspective. Our capital commitment we haven't disclosed that. But it's in the grand scheme of things from a development point of view it's relatively minor, especially when you consider the CPE business that we've always been in where we've actually had to buy CPE. This in many cases will be a retail product. So -- and lastly... Yeah. Yeah. We don't manage the margins. We managed to return on investment. And so we try to generate as much cash on each asset that we deploy as we can and has really nothing to do with margins when you have a mix of products with different kinds of margins in them. And so it's only in a static environment that a margin relative -- relative margin has any value as an analysis tool in our -- from our point of view. Exactly. Thanks, Jessica. Peter, we'll take our next question, please. But another part of your question was what's the overall broadband penetration. And if you take all those smaller speeds slow speed products, it's in the mid-80s. And as I said earlier I think that goes up towards the vacancy rate. Like I was speaking about marketing earlier that's a form of price. We have lots of opportunity to mix and match various tactics to create value for customers perceived value. But fundamental value is where we're really trying to drive our product, which is having superior products at lower prices than our competitors by doing smart investments and good technologies that allow us to have a lower cost structure and have a lower cost per bit so to speak available to consumers both in the mobile space and in the broadband space and in the video space to the extent it's a separate business. And we can mix and match those value propositions in a variety of ways depending on what we need to do to move customer perceptions about where the true value is in the product set. Jessica, you want answer the bad debt question? And with regard to video, why we're somewhat of an outlier, we try hard for one thing. And again, we try to put value where we can for the consumer and think that, there's still opportunity in video. And one of the things that we had success with is, the creation of additional packaging and the mix of video products that we actually sell to consumers. And we're continuously improving the right structures around what we're able to sell. And it's been difficult because of the way historically video has been packaged in this very fat expensive bundle that's driven by sports rights costs. And as we've been able to get some of the content out of that, the ecosystem, and put into tiers and we're successfully selling those. And I think over time, we'll be able to build a very nice video business. All right. Well, in terms of sentiment, yes, there have been periods in my business career in cable where sentiment has gone up and down. And my sentiment remains the same. And I think, it's a great business and I think we have great opportunity to take and to continue to grow the business successfully. And so, when everybody's euphoric, it's probably odd. And when everybody is pessimistic, it's odd, and I'm unchanged. And my experiences with Cablevision and other assets, I managed Time Warner assets as well, prior to that, and have managed competition. My first job as a general manager in 1980, was an overbuild, actually. And so, I have lots of experience with it and lots of success in growing our businesses in that environment. So there's nothing unusual about what's going on now. And actually, from a competitive environment, it's pretty much unchanged, the pace of what's been going on, notwithstanding that there are some small builds going on elsewhere with private equity, as you say and that LEC expansion has continued. But it hasn't gone up in pace. So -- and we do quite well, regardless of whether we're in a physical competition with a wireline builder or whether we're in competition with satellites or whether we're in competition with a fixed wireless asset. We're pretty comfortable that we can continue to drive our value proposition and continue to grow our customer relationships. So my sentiment is unchanged. And are there opportunities for us to buy some infrastructure companies that would help us make our network better, because they happen to be in the right place? There probably is. I was optimistic last year and I was optimistic the year before that and still am. Thanks Ben. And in terms of the pace of upgrades, we're actually doing multiple upgrades in various parts of the country right now. And we're pacing ourselves in such a way that we're learning how to do it really effectively. The interesting thing about our capacity to do these upgrades is that they're quite simple electronic upgrades. They're relatively inexpensive and we can do them rapidly across as much of our footprint as we need to do. And we're just actually putting ourselves in a position right now so that we can execute at the pace we need to execute given where the demand for that kind of capacity will exist. And we haven't really forecasted that publicly in terms of how fast we're going to do that."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Tom. Let's now turn to our customer results on slide five. We grew total residential and SMB customer relationships by 129,000 in the first quarter. Including residential and SMB, we grew our Internet customer relationships by 185,000 in the quarter. We continue to see record low combined competitive and move churn, which has reduced our selling opportunities and very low non-pay churn across our footprint. Similar to the fourth quarter, we saw both lower Internet churn and lower Internet connects than in the first quarters of 2021, 2020 and 2019. And this was true across our footprint regardless of computing technology. Turning to video. Video customers declined by 112,000 in the first quarter. Wireline voice declined by 150,000 and we added 373,000 mobile lines. Despite the lower number of selling opportunities from reduced activity levels, we continue to drive mobile growth with our high-quality attractively priced service. Moving to financial results starting on slide six. Over the last year we grew total residential customers by 674,000 or 2.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship increased by 1% year-over-year, driven by promotional rate step-ups and video rate adjustments that pass through programmer rate increases. These effects were partially offset by the same bundle and mix trends we've seen over the past year, including a higher mix of non-video customers and a higher mix of low-priced video packages within our base. Additionally, this quarter's revenue was negatively impacted by $20 million in adjustments related to sports network rebates, which we intend to credit to qualified video consumers. These rebates are also reflected in lower programming expense this quarter, with no impact to adjusted EBITDA. Excluding the impact of sports network credit I just mentioned, our residential ARPU grew by 1.2% year-over-year. Also keep in mind that our residential ARPU does not reflect any mobile revenue or video programming pass-through increases announced late in the first quarter. As slide six shows, residential revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year and by 3.9% year-over-year, when excluding the sports network credit. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 4.6% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 4.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.7% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.5% and enterprise PSUs grew by 5.2% year-over-year. First quarter advertising revenue grew by 11.5% year-over-year or by 5.1% excluding political revenue, primarily due to our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Mobile revenue totaled $690 million with $292 million of that revenue being device revenue. Other revenue increased by 5.2% year-over-year and includes two months of rural construction initiative subsidies totaling $19 million. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 5.4% year-over-year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $410 million or 5.4% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 0.4% year-over-year, due to a decline in video customers of 2.1%, a higher mix of lighter video packages, a $20 million benefit related to sports network rebates that I mentioned and $34 million of other favorable adjustments, much of which was not unique year-over-year. All of that was mostly offset by higher programming rates. Excluding both of the adjustments I just mentioned, programming costs grew by 1.4%. And looking at the full year 2022, we now expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the low to mid single-digit percentage range versus mid single-digits previously. Regulatory connectivity and produced content declined by 7.4%, primarily driven by lower Lakers RSN costs, lower video CPE sold to customers and lower regulatory and franchise fees. The decline in Lakers costs was primarily driven by the delayed start to the NBA season in 2020, which drove more Lakers games charges into Q1 of 2021, making for an easier comparison this year. Excluding the RSN costs from both years, regulatory, connectivity and produced content declined by 5.6%. And for the full year 2022, we expect regulatory connectivity and produced content expense to decline in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2021, primarily due to lower video CPE sold to customers and lower RSN costs given the abnormal Lakers game scheduled last year. Cost to service customers increased by 5.3% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by higher bad debt given unusually low bad debt in the first quarter of 2021 when bad debt was down $100 million versus the first quarter of 2020, benefiting from the government stimulus packages. In fact, payment trends in the first quarter continue to be very good. And excluding bad debt from both years, cost to service customers grew by 1.8%, primarily due to a larger customer base, previously planned wage increases to $20 per hour starting wage, for hourly field operations and call center employees and higher health benefit and fuel costs. As the year progresses, prior year bad debt expense normalizes and should drive meaningfully slower growth in cost to service expense line during the second half of the year. Marketing expenses grew by 10.1% year-over-year due to higher labor costs, driven by previously planned wage increases and temporarily greater staffing levels, as Charter completes the in-sourcing of its inbound sales and retention call centers with a focus on providing better service to new and existing customers. For the full year 2022, we expect marketing expense to grow in the mid single-digit percentage range versus 2021, although marketing expense growth is likely to remain at elevated levels in the second quarter. Mobile expense totaled $760 million and were comprised of mobile device cost tied to device revenue, customer acquisition and service and operating costs. And other expenses increased by 12.5%, primarily driven by a favorable non-recurring adjustment in the prior year period making for a challenging comparison this year and higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 5.4% year-over-year in the quarter. A quick note about inflation before moving on to net income. Certain costs of operating our business such as labor and fuel costs are currently subject to inflationary pressure. But given our previously planned move to a $20 per hour starting wage and our long-term relationships and contracts for goods and services, we haven't yet seen a significant impact on inflation in our P&L. I would also note that our consumers are experiencing inflationary pressure but given the availability of subsidies for broadband and our focus on saving customers hundreds of dollars per year by switching to our converged connectivity product, we believe we are well positioned for the changing market. Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter versus $800 million last year. The year-over-year increase was driven by a non-recurring litigation settlement charge in other operating expenses for the first quarter of 2021 and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $1.9 billion in the first quarter just above last year's first quarter spend of $1.8 billion. We spent a total of $232 million on our rural construction initiative in the quarter. Most of that spend relates to design, walk out and make ready and as expected has not yet resulted in significant passings growth. And the vast majority of that spend is accounted for in line extension. We spent $74 million on mobile-related CapEx, which is mostly accounted for in support capital and was driven by investments in back-office systems. As Slide 10 shows,, we generated $1.8 billion of consolidated free cash flow this quarter, a decrease of $55 million or 3% year-over-year. Excluding a one-time litigation payment of $220 million made in the first quarter free cash flow grew by $165 million or 8.9% year-over-year. Please note that in the second quarter we'll begin making quarterly cash tax payments for fiscal year 2022. These payments are consistent with the cash tax outlook that we provided in our fourth quarter investor call. We finished the quarter with $94.9 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $4.4 billion. As of the end of the first quarter our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.43 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased six million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $3.6 billion at an average purchase price of $600 per share. And since September of 2016, we've repurchased $60.4 billion or nearly 42% of Charter's equity. Our path to continue to grow our business remains strong and we will do that by furthering convergence in our connectivity business allowing us to capture additional share, focusing on expanding our footprint and by continuing to improve the customer experience and extending customer lives. By executing on those items we will drive customer and share growth, free cash flow growth and shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yes, we did start booking RDOF revenue in Q1, Phil. They're two months in for the total of $19 million. And the run rate on the RDOF booking will be at that. So it gets booked in over the 10-year period that we receive the funds. So we'll have it at that just over $9 million a month from now until 10-years from now. The last one was a question on margins and where we think ...margins ultimately could go. I mean it's hard to comment on margins in the context of our business because your mix of video product makes such a difference. And ultimately, we're trying to sell the right mix of products to the consumer that drives the most cash flow per customer which doesn't necessarily drive the most margin, on a financial statement presentation sort of basis. So I would say on that one it's hard to speculate on where exactly margins would go as a percentage. But ultimately, we think that what we're doing by capturing additional share in the mobile market, using that and capturing additional share in the broadband market, which drives sort of the most cash flow off of our assets and in our other services as well, we think that that's the right thing to do to drive cash flow for the business and to continue to grow regardless of what the margin line ultimately shows. Yeah. So if I start on the expense items Vijay, the bad debt we're not back to pre-pandemic levels. I don't expect us actually to go all the way back to pre-pandemic levels. The subsidies for broadband that are available in the market have eased the impact on consumers of sort of what happens in the economy and just made it easier to pay for services overall. And they are targeted, obviously, those consumers who are more prone to go non-pay in the first place. So non-pay churn overall continues to be at near-record lows. And I think that, right now we haven't seen yet sort of moves back towards pre-pandemic levels. On the RDOF side, I think that spend in the rural construction initiative overall, I wouldn't expect it to sort of trend at a very steady level over time. There will be opportunities that we have to accelerate spend at points in time and as we have those opportunities, because we think that continuing the build is important, we likely will take them. I think we've accelerated right now some of the kind of spend that I talked about happening in this quarter the design and make-ready type expenses. We're trying to pull those forward, so that we can be ready to deploy as quickly as possible sort of to deploy more going into next year. It's \u2013 that's not a change in guide sort of on where we think we're going for overall. But I think as I said, when we issued \u2013 when we talked about the $1 billion that we hoped to spend for the year, we could spend more or we could spend less than that. And it's all based on what we're able to do. We're going as fast as we can. I guess I'll start on the leverage target question. If I think about where we are right now rates have obviously increased versus where they've been in the recent past. In historical context, I think that rates are still quite low. And so maybe not a little bit, but in line with where we'd expect them to be. In the -- from a growth perspective, as you just heard from Tom and Chris I think we continue to be quite optimistic about our growth opportunity. And on the sentiment side, our stock is trading at a multiple to free cash flow even that's just pretty low compared to where we've been. And so I think that we're happy with where we're sitting targeting the high end of our four to 4.5 times leverage ratio. We obviously continue to evaluate over time. It would be hard to sort of break out what scenario exactly would cause us to move off of that space. But I think that we're happy with where we are and we'll continue to target at that level."

I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, which we encourage you to read carefully. Various remarks that we make on today's call concerning expectations, predictions, plans and prospects, constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. In 2023, we added 155,000 Internet customers, and we added nearly 2.5 million Spectrum Mobile lines for growth of nearly 50%. At the end of 2023, we had more than 7.7 million total mobile lines. Only 13% of our Internet customers now have mobile service. And we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years, as the quality and value of our converged connectivity services gains wider recognition. Revenue was up by 1% in 2023, while EBITDA grew by 1.3% and 2.5% when excluding advertising. While we are executing well on our long-term strategic initiatives and Spectrum One is working to drive mobile growth, Internet growth in our existing footprint has been challenging, driven by admittedly more persistent competition from fixed wireless and similar levels of wireline overbuild activity. Small changes in gross additions and churn in a low transaction environment have driven outsized impacts to net gains, which was clearly the case as we moved through the last quarter. I own that. So, let me start with what we believe on the competitive environment and then what we're doing to drive long-term growth by delivering high-quality products and service at a great price. Fixed wireless access: While an inferior product with limited capacity and geographic coverage which is fluid, is often marketed by the phone companies at a perceived lower-priced to their existing customers. We continue to believe the impact from fixed wireless is temporary. Our Internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. Customer bandwidth needs continue to increase. And MNOs will face capacity challenges and will be required to allocate their Spectrum and capital to maintain profitable mobile services. While we can't promise when that happens, I believe bandwidth needs to increase and quality and value win. On the wireline overbuild front, we continue to compete well. Overbuild impact tends to be limited to a few percentage points of Internet penetration during the first year of a new overbuild vintage coming online. It's painful, but it's tied to the pace of overbuild. We don't see overbuilders reaching their penetration and ROI goals now -- within our footprint now or in the future. They don't have the same ubiquitous convergence capabilities as we do, their lower-cost passings have likely been built, some of the planned overbuild was duplicative between operators, meaning less opportunity, and incremental financing cost have increased, putting even more pressure on overbuilder returns. We also expect BEAD passings will provide better capital allocation and ROI for many of these operators. Our assumption is that our competitors are rational economic players with shareholders and balance sheets, which require adequate return on investment. That isn't within our control. So, we are focused on the key strategic initiatives that enhance our long-term competitiveness and growth capabilities, and we expect to return to a more normalized Internet growth over time. Just over a year from when we detailed those initiatives, I wanted to remind everyone of the rationale and update you on their status, as laid out in Slide 4. Our footprint expansion is beating our pacing, penetration, ARPU and ROI targets. New construction will help drive Internet customer growth despite the temporary challenges I mentioned within our existing footprint. 2023 subsidized rural customer growth was already over 100,000. Our penetration also continues to grow at a better-than-expected pace and we'll cover more -- we'll activate more subsidized rural passings this year, both of which Jessica will cover. BEAD will provide additional opportunities, although the potential is uncertain given our concerns regarding how states will apply NTIA guidelines. We'll focus BEAD investments in states where the rules are conducive to private investment. Outside of rural, we also have accelerated greenfield, market fill-in and serviceability builds, expanding our existing footprint in both residential and commercial passings. Penetration curves and returns here are similarly strong and predictable with a lower build cost. We also remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience via our execution initiative, which is intended to enhance frontline employees' tenure while simultaneously investing in digitization, all to drive better sales yields, higher-quality transactions, lower overall service transactions and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our targeted investments in employees over the last two years resulted in a significant reduction in employee attrition in 2023. Our investments in the digitization of service is also driving efficiencies. In 2024, we have a number of new automated platforms that are launching to facilitate better service for customers and better digital and AI tools for agents to enhance service quality and the quality of their day-to-day jobs. And finally, our evolution initiative, which includes our network evolution project, our convergence efforts, and video product development all remain on course. We fully launched symmetrical speed tiers in two markets and currently launching in six more, completing our step one markets. We'll also begin to work in our step two markets with DAA later this year. Excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. And we expect to complete the project in 2026, so fast, ubiquitous, low-cost upgrade of our capabilities, which our competitors can't replicate. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and grow. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like mobile speed boost and the Spectrum Mobile network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotion and at retail. And Spectrum One customers reaching their first anniversary are performing ahead of our expectations. We'll continue to evolve our converged offering in 2024 with additional features and capabilities. Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product, in October, we launched the Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the U.S., Xumo is our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're approaching 1 million deployed Xumo boxes since launch and we've been getting great customer feedback, and we can keep improving our attach rates. In early January, Disney+ became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost. And in the next several months, ESPN+ and ViX, a Spanish language DTC product, will both become available to certain TV Select customers at no extra cost. This new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers and we plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal. That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or Charter to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. Our new hybrid distribution model, combined with Xumo's content-forward interface, provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value and utility with seamless linear, DTC and SVOD integration and advanced search and discovery functionality. When we reflect on our key initiatives and what we believe are the short-term market challenges, we're acting as long-term Charter shareholders to maximize value. So, we have a posture of expectancy and excitement for the opportunity to execute on initiatives that enhance our long-term growth rate and value for Charter shareholders. In the short term, we are leaving no stone unturned as it relates to our go-to-market approach. Ultimately, the speed at which we can return to a more normalized broadband growth rate hinges on the assumption that our competitors' capital is not limitless for poor ROI projects and, frankly, our execution on our strategic initiatives. So, we're keeping our heads down and executing on a clear strategy to ensure we can offer customers the best products and services across our entire footprint, all while saving customers money, not only now, but in the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 61,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter, while video customers declined by 257,000. In mobile, we added 546,000 mobile lines, and wireline voice customers declined by 251,000. Our Spectrum One product continued to perform well. Customers that signed up for our Spectrum One product in the fourth quarter of 2022 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Those promotional roll-offs didn't drive incremental Internet churn. In the quarter, we had slightly lower mobile line gross adds year-over-year tied to Internet gross additions with a lower churn rate year-over-year and flat sequentially. We continue to see healthy data usage at our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines will perform well as long-term customers. Turning to rural. We ended the year with 420,000 subsidized rural passings and grew those passings by 295,000 in 2023, in-line with our target, and by 105,000 in the fourth quarter alone, an acceleration from this 78,000 we activated during the third quarter. Customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint also accelerated, with 34,000 net customer additions in the quarter. As Slide 13 shows, we're generating customer penetrations of close to 50% in cohorts that have reached or passed the 12-month mark. In 2024, we expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings, about 50% more than in 2023, with seasonality in the first quarter tied to the winter weather. Slide 12 shows that so far, with additional state bids that we expect, we will have committed to build approximately 1.75 million subsidized rural passings. We also expect our RDOF build to be completed by end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 7. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.3%, with video-only customer churn, partly offset by new customer growth driven by Internet. Residential revenue per customer relationship was up 0.1% year-over-year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, mostly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base. As Slide 7 shows, in total, residential revenue was flat year-over-year. Residential Internet ARPU grew by 2.2% year-over-year, but by 3.4% when excluding the impact of Spectrum One GAAP revenue allocation out of Internet into mobile. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.7% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.5% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%. Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23.4% or $130 million year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 0.7% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 24.4% year-over-year, driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 0.3% year-over-year and up 1.3% year-over-year when excluding advertising. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses declined by 0.7% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 10.6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 6.8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. For the full year 2024, we expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year with our video package mix being the largest variable. Other cost of revenue increased by 15%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 2.1% year-over-year, driven by additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by productivity improvements, including from 10-year investments, and lower service transactions per customer. Looking forward, I would note that our previous investments related to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer-tenured workforce are now largely complete and service transaction trends are back on trajectory after the programming dispute in September. Sales and marketing costs declined by 1.6%, primarily driven by lower labor costs. Finally, other expenses grew by 1.5%, driven by labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.6% year-over-year in the quarter and by 3.6% when excluding advertising. Turning to net income on Slide 9, we generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year, driven by a pension remeasurement loss and higher interest expense, partly offset by a gain on the sale of towers and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, just below last year's fourth quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $978 million, $50 million higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfields and market sell-in opportunities. Fourth quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by lower spend on scalable infrastructure and lower spend on CPE due to purchase timing, partly offset by higher spend on upgrade/rebuild, primarily network evolution. For the full year 2023, we spent $11.1 billion. Looking ahead at full year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. On Slide 11, we've provided our current expectations for capital spending through the year 2027, excluding any possible line extension spend associated with the BEAD program. The slide divides our spending into three categories: line extensions, network evolution and core CapEx spend. As the slide shows, we expect CapEx spend of just over $12 billion in 2024 to fall to approximately $8 billion by 2027. Our line extension CapEx includes spending for greenfield, market sell-in and serviceability builds from our legacy footprint, driving continued expansion of residential and commercial passings. In turn, our non-rural passings growth should continue to be robust and similar to 2023 growth, subject to the pace of overall housing growth. These passings are natural extensions or pocket fill-ins to our network and have a long track record of low cost per passing and reliable penetration trends to contribute to growth at attractive ROI. We've not included the potential impact of BEAD in the passing figures on Slide 12 or in our CapEx outlook on Slide 11, given the regulatory and bidding uncertainty associated with the program. We don't expect any potential BEAD build subject to acceptable guidelines, as Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025. And similar to our peers and competitors, our success in BEAD will be an overlay to our capital expenditure outlook. Turning to network evolution, where our long-term capital expenditures outlook remains essentially unchanged, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve our network to offer multi-gigabit speeds. Finally, core capital expenditures, which excludes line extensions and network evolution, has remained consistent as a percentage of revenue since 2021. And following the completion of our network evolution initiative, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications. Turning to free cash flow on Slide 14. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $75 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by less favorable change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures, partly offset by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures. Just a brief comment on cash taxes for 2024 before turning to the balance sheet. We currently expect our calendar year 2024 cash tax payments under current legislation to land between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, depending on a number of factors. We finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principle. In the first weeks of 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured floating rate notes and paid in full all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured notes. So, we no longer have any significant debt maturities due in 2024. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt in the next three years at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $90 million or 2% of that run rate interest expense. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.42 times, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.3 billion at an average price of $419 per share. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I want to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program for Internet and mobile customers. While we still hope the ACP program will be allocated additional funding, we're well aware that the program could end this spring, and we're designing programs to assist those that are on the ACP program. There is no doubt that the end of the program would be disruptive for many. Nonetheless, we will have the full benefit of our high-quality sales and retention force as well as our mobile product, which saves customers hundreds of dollars to preserve connections. With the continued temporary impact from fixed wireless and the potential end of ACP, we may continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds as we enter 2024. Despite those short-term challenges, we are competing well and are focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024. A component of that has been to reflect inflation in our pricing while preserving value to our customers. We're also actively managing expenses, and we believe we can do so without impacting our sales, service and broader growth initiatives. But most importantly, we remain focused on long term and a return to more normalized Internet growth. We have what we believe are the best products at the best prices in our industry and we remain underpenetrated relative to our long-term potential. Taking advantage of that opportunity is what will ultimately create the most shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. One for Chris and one for Jessica. For Chris, I'm wondering if you can give us some context on whether there was a change in competitive dynamics in the fourth quarter. As we look out across the fixed wireless guys and the fiber guys, it seemed pretty steady over the course of the last few quarters, sort of competitive pressures that seem to stabilize. And I'm wondering if there was just a bigger focus on -- from fixed wireless or potentially fiber in newer markets specifically? And then, for Jessica, the cash tax guidance is great. If bonus depreciation is expanded -- extended this year, how much of that cash tax go down by? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Good. So, in terms of the competitive environment in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, we saw some continued expansion of fixed wireless footprint within the quarter. We also saw heavier competitive marketing and some aggressive promotions from both fixed wireless and from the overbuilders. And as you know, Jonathan, slight impacts to gross adds and churn, in this case, it was particularly on the gross adds front, can drive what appear to be outsized changes to net adds, especially when net adds are slightly positive or slightly negative, really has an outsized impact. As you know, we're, of course, focused very much on the long term, but that doesn't mean that we're not focused on the short term either, particularly what was going on inside of the fourth quarter. And so, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really leaving no stone unturned on potential ways to improve go-to-market in the short term, particularly addressing gross adds in the existing footprint. We're doing all that though, looking at all aspects, but trying to make sure that we do that in a controlled fashion and don't overreact either given that it is small changes that are driving an outsized impact here.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. And I'd add on, the environment wasn't consistent through the quarter. Early on, we had some carryover from the Disney dispute in the August rate event that we talked about in last quarter's call. We had expected November and December to recover to the levels that we had seen going into that event, and they didn't. But as we exited the quarter, we saw December slightly negative, and January net adds are consistent with what we saw in December. So that environment does continue. On the cash tax side, Jonathan, it's not just bonus, it's also R&D and interest expense deductions that will impact us. But I would say the reforms that are being considered support the economics of our investments in connecting rural America and upgrading the network. And so, we are fully in support of them. I think it's a little premature to adjust our guidance. But given the investments that we're making, we do expect there to be a material benefit to cash taxes if the legislation were to go through.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, guys.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. Luke, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. A couple of questions. Jessica, thank you for the comments you made about ACP. I'm wondering if you can just try to quantify a little bit more for us the number of ACP subscribers that you have, and if you have insight into how many of those are new subscribers versus previously were paying subscribers. And then, I wonder if you could also just comment about T-Mobile indicated that they expect 100,000 to 150,000 fewer net adds per quarter in fixed wireless. How do you think about that flowing into your footprint? And does that inform the way you think about the broadband growth rate going forward?\nChris Winfrey: So maybe I'll start off with ACP and just take a step back, and then Jessica can answer what you were requesting. ACP program, I think as everybody knows, it really has brought Internet connectivity to customers who would not have been able to have access to broadband otherwise. But more importantly, it's allowed customers who would have been coming in and out of the broadband marketplace given affordability issues to remain connected consistently. So, we really think, as you know, it's been an effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. We still -- we're hopeful that the ACP can be refunded in order to keep households that are in the program today connected to the Internet. But if it's not refunded, Craig, we're going to work very hard to keep customers connected. And we've been working on this possibility for some time. We have significant tools to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars, as Jessica mentioned. And I'd highlight that, keep in mind, most of our ACP customers were Internet customers before the ACP program began. And in the meantime, having said all that, it's actually pretty challenging for us to predict the impact that a potential end of the program is going to have to our customer disconnects, but we're going to report that consistently over time.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. So, on the numbers side, Craig, we have a little over 5 million households that received the ACP benefit, all for wireline Internet. Very few of those customers used ACP to upgrade to higher speeds or take more PSUs when they began receiving the benefit. But many do have our flagship speed or higher or do take other services from us. And I guess, the funding will continue through April. We'll try to keep people informed as we move through the process. But from our perspective, there's not a lot of visibility at this point as to anything that might happen when the program ends.\nChris Winfrey: In the end, we're still focused on trying to make sure that ACP is refunded, and I still think there's a strong possibility that could be the case.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. Do you want to talk to the fixed wireless lower net add guidance?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. So, we noted the same thing that you saw, Craig. I think the bigger point there is that there is a rational approach to the marketplace and the utilization of Spectrum. And I believe a recognition that there's a limited amount of capacity, the bandwidth needs are increasing. I think that was the bigger takeaway from us. It's very difficult for us to sit back and take a look at the geographic footprint of fixed wireless access because it almost changes by the day in terms of sector availability on radius in terms of capacity and where they're actively marketing and where they're not. And then, you have the additional rural footprint versus urban and suburban, and what would be off-footprint for us versus on-footprint and the split between residential and commercial, which makes it pretty difficult to mathematically cascade that into an impact for us. But I thought it was rational what we said, and I thought it made a lot of sense, and I think it's consistent with what we've always thought. Frankly, the piece that's been more difficult is just the timing in terms of where that capacity is reached, and it's been a little bit harder to predict than we would like. But I took that as the same way that you did that it should have some positive impact on our existing footprint.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. Luke, we'll take our next question, pleas.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning. Chris, question for you on CapEx, and then I want to ask Jessica about sort of EBITDA growth. Chris, you've been around the cable industry for a long time. So, I know you are aware that kind of investment priorities can change over time. And I'm just curious why you felt it made sense to sort of guide out to 2027, just because you're in a competitive dynamic industry and want to evolve your strategy over time. And it did seem like you guys have -- and you can disagree, but it seems like you've prioritized the line extensions over getting network evolution done by '25. So, I know we thought it might slip into '26, but now it's definitely slipping into '26. Just wanted to understand your thought process there. If that was tied to kind of equipment availability or just a strategic decision? And then, Jessica, there's an expectation that '24 is a good EBITDA growth year for Charter given the investments you've made in OpEx. I think you cited 3.5% growth in Q4 ex advertising. Anything you can tell us to help us think about financial performance for the business in '24 would be appreciated. Thanks everyone.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. So, Ben, I think leading into the last earnings call, we had been listening to shareholder feedback about the difficulty people were having of projecting long-term CapEx trends given the significant capital investment opportunities that we have. And you're right, typically, we would never provide a multiyear outlook and we've -- about the only guidance that we've historically provided is in-year CapEx guidance. But these are unique opportunities that don't come around very often. The opportunity to have subsidized rural build, having the largest expansion of broadband and cable footprint really since the 1980s is unique and it's generational. And I think we felt that investors needed to see, A, the size and magnitude of what we were already committed to, and B, to have a very articulated outline of the returns of those investments, which Jessica has provided. We've been providing that, all that information is essentially what we provided over the past two years, but to do it in a single spot so people could wrap their heads around both the quantum that exist, the investment returns that are attached to that investment and that it doesn't go on into perpetuity, and that there is a real nice setup for what this is all about, which is free cash flow growth. And so, while we typically like to keep our cards close to our chest to preserve both flexibility and to maintain our competitive posture, I felt there was a trade-off here to make sure that our shareholders were with us and that people understood the value of the returns to the investment that we're making. And so, there's a balance here between, on one hand, having the flexibility to always make the right decisions to generate long-term free cash flow, and making sure that we're responsive to shareholder feedback along the way and that we can demonstrate the long-term value, so people take comfort with that. In terms of the prioritization of line extensions over the DAA or DOCSIS 4 upgrade, it wasn't so much about prioritization. It was really about certification of the DAA equipment taking a little bit longer, which was pushing out the timeline for the rollout. And so, the trade-off we had is could you do it the 1.2 gigahertz high-split upgrade under, what we call, an integrated CMTS environment. And do more of that footprint to keep the original pace or should we slow it down just a tad to make sure that we allowed for a catch-up of the DAA certification process so that you can move to high split with distributed access architecture as well as the 1.8 gigahertz and the rollout of DOCSIS 4.0, we chose the latter to make sure that we were having as much of the footprint with the full capabilities of DOCSIS 4.0 over time. The caveat is, if we get into couple of years from now, we see opportunities to pull capital forward. We'll of course do that, but this is our best view of where we're going to spend capital. And we thought it was worthwhile to show that to make sure people understand that it doesn't -- that higher level of capital expenditure doesn't go on into perpetuity.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. On the EBITDA performance inside of 2024, I guess -- I'm not going to give EBITDA guidance, but I think we can talk about the few things. So, you do have a political advertising year, that is a tailwind. We have -- so we've fully lapped the investments that we made in the employee population. And from an expense outlook perspective, I think my expectation is that we'll be able to keep cost to serve essentially flat on an absolute basis. And in sales and marketing, you might have some growth, but it will be small in the 2% to 3% range. And we continue -- as I said in my remarks, we're taking a look at expenses all across the business to identify areas where we can be more efficient and reduce costs without impacting our service levels and our sales capability. And so, we fully understand that we need to maintain EBITDA growth in this environment and strong EBITDA growth coming into what, as you note, should be a stronger year in order to be able to continue focusing on what we want for the long term, which is to be able to invest to grow in the long term and to return to that sort of Internet customer growth in the long term. So, I think the dynamics in the background are happening to make that growth happen. That's where we are.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Okay. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Ben.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. Luke, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks for that color, Jessica. Just a follow-up on EBITDA growth and one of the components, revenue per customer. It's been relatively flat for the last couple of quarters and there's a lot of moving parts in terms of pricing and customers rolling-off Spectrum One. But, how should we think about progressing through '24, especially with the -- I think the most recent data price increase in August? And do you believe your pricing power in the broadband market has changed given the new sort of competitive landscape we have, or can you continue to push pricing as that lapse mid-year? Number one. And then, on the mobile strategy, anything you can tell us about what mobile is doing in terms of lowering churn in the broadband market? Is it also helping you in terms of new connection and driving new subscribers or just really churn reduction? And then, anything we should expect to change as you sort of proceed with some of the build out measures you're taking to add your own capacity?\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. So, I'll start with ARPU. When you look at average revenue per customer overall, John, the biggest factor that's keeping it flat is the rate of video penetration. So, what matters there is the extent to which we can retain video customers with some of the package and pricing strategies that we have. If you isolate and you sort of pull out Internet ARPU, you can see even in the remarks that I made on the quarter that Internet ARPU continues to grow, and when you pull out the Spectrum One Mobile allocation, continues to grow at a rate that's consistent or even a little higher than historical level. On the mobile side, I talked about it on the last call. As you have -- so because we've sort of lapsed the free line offer, the number of free lines that we have in the system over the course of 2024 is more steady than it was in 2023. So, you'll also see that the impact of that mobile allocation over to the Internet should steady over time. And you'll have, just as a matter of math, more paying customers in the base as a proportion relative to the free lines. So, I think that's the piece there. I don't know, Chris, do you want to talk about pricing power?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. In broadband, our fundamental view hasn't changed that in the long term, keeping your prices as low as you can both enhances your ability to grow, and that's still our long-term objective, it reduces churn, and it reduces the likelihood that somebody views you as an attractive overbuilt candidate. So, our fundamental views haven't changed. Having said that, we've had inflationary pressures, and we've been passing that through to the best of our ability. To the extent that our pricing is lower and it is for the most part across the industry, I view that as a positive long-term capacity question and from an ability to grow. But it doesn't mean that we're immune to inflation. It doesn't mean that we're not willing to pass-through increases as we need to. And there's a balance here as well that in an environment where we're investing so much into expansion and making sure that we do maintain EBITDA growth rate so that we can keep that engine going, it matters to us and it matters to our shareholders, and we're focused on that in parallel. So, there's a balance that's taking place. And I think we're in a not only in a good position overall, but I think a very good relative position. In terms of the overall market, you've seen different operators across the sector moving their prices up over time as well. And I think that demonstrates that there's real value to the product, and there's a need to recover cost along the way. It's a capital-intensive business. And then, your last question on -- John, is mobile churn. The contribution of mobile to the broadband business, the biggest factor so far as you highlighted really has been a significant and a very material amount of churn reduction that takes place on those customers who attach mobile, as I mentioned, it's only 13% of our base today. And I'd offer you two pieces. One is on the positive side, it is dramatic, the churn reduction. On the -- just to be balanced, there's still self-selection that exists inside that base. So, I want to be careful that we don't overplay the benefit there on what's still a relatively small portion of our Internet base and growing and has big upside. The new connects, those new Internet connects who take mobile, a percentage of our mobile acquisition mix that comes from new customers has risen over the years. Is that because we do a better job of selling it to call center and attaching or is it because mobile is actually driving gross adds? In this environment, we have so many different moving parts. I'm not comfortable telling you that it's been a big driver as of yet of new sales. But I think that's the opportunity, not only for churn reduction, but as convergence continues to take hold as these products work together in a way that our competitors can't replicate, the ability to use Spectrum One, a combination of broadband, Internet, WiFi and 5G is our backup radio. It's the slowest portion of our network, and have the fastest overall connectivity service and seamless connectivity, I think, it's powerful. And I think it has the ability not just to reduce churn, which it's already doing today, but to actually drive acquisition over time. And so, we're early on, but still very exciting.\nJohn Hodulik: Okay. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, John. Luke, we'll take our next question, please. Thanks. Luke?\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nPeter Supino: Good morning. I have a couple of questions on the subject of growth investment. Slide 11 discusses cost per core passing in your forecast of $2,000 to $2,500 and that struck me as high relative to historical core passings and even relative to fiber expansion. So, I wanted to see what you could share about your assumptions for penetration and ARPU in that footprint. And then, on a related note, again, on core growth investment, but moving over to BEAD, we've seen big increases over the last couple of years since the money for BEAD was allocated in the availability and uptake of fixed wireless services over midband. We expect more increases in the availability of LEO satellite services, not just Starlink, but Amazon's product. And so, I'm wondering if your outlook for penetration in that potential BEAD footprint is moderating and if that affects your appetite at all. Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. So, I'll start on the cost per passing question. What you see there is related to the mix between commercial and even enterprise passings and residential passing. So, the cost per resi passing that lives inside of that is closer to $1,500. What's happening is that there are, I'm going to say, a smaller number, but a larger dollar amount of commercial passings that are included in the mix that drive the average cost per passing to be a little bit higher. And we're just trying to give enough information there to get you to a reasonable passings estimate so that -- so you can model off of that what gains you would generate from the build.\nChris Winfrey: And then, in terms of the penetration, Peter, there's very different types of build that sits in there. I mean, serviceability, which is where a customer calls us effectively for a one-off or two or three additional line extensions, the penetration on that is 85%, as it should be. And other areas where greenfield or market fill-in where penetrations can range anywhere between 45% and 70%, at a lower cost per passing, as Jessica highlighted, than some of the other extension build that we do. So, the returns are very, very attractive. They always have been. There's nothing really new there. And somewhat tied to that, you asked about our views on penetration generally, but in the context of BEAD with fixed wireless access or low Earth orbit satellite, LEO. I think the -- let me start with LEO. This is an expensive offering on a month per month basis, expensive from a CPE standpoint. And it needs to be because the -- if I told you our network was going to fall to the ground every six to eight years and burn up, you'd tell me that's a pretty capital-intensive business that needs to be priced appropriately, and it is. I think LEO has a really good use in certain cases, but it's typically not going to be where our fiber-based network is deployed. And so, it's not something that really has risen too much in terms of our thinking in penetration. Fixed wireless access, it's shown us that you can have lower quality and inferior service at a low price or low incremental price, and there's a market for that. But our penetration expectations for RDOF and for subsidized rural and what will feed into BEAD were already low in terms of what we've built into our models compared to what I think ultimately we'll achieve. And so, I think that's already reflected inside of our penetrations. If you think about just at the 12-month mark, where we're approaching close to 50% in the subsidized rural passings, our initial thoughts were we'd be at half of that within a year. And so, we're way ahead of that. And I think the terminal penetration will be higher than what we thought at RDOF, despite the fact that there's an admittedly stronger fixed wireless access presence now than there was three, four years ago when we made those commitments. So, all a big roundabout way to say, I think it's factored into all of our thinking. And I don't think it changes our view in terms of where we'll ultimately get to for terminal penetration, because we weren't overly aggressive in what we assumed.\nJessica Fischer: Yeah. And...\nPeter Supino: That's helpful. Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: We mentioned the less than 50% -- or the 50% or so at about the 12-month-plus mark. But as you can see and what we provided and all of the cohorts that we are seeing, we're still growing at a good rate at that point. So, it's not as though you've reached the customers who are going to get your product and then we're not seeing additional growth. We're still seeing good growth in those markets even at that vantage.\nChris Winfrey: It's early. It's going well.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up on the competitive environment, just based upon the previous response. Just any help on thinking about the fixed wireless impact in terms of your -- is that just isolated or the competitive environment that has perhaps shifted in 4Q and persisted into January? Is that isolated in your non-fiber overlap territories or you're seeing that as well be somewhat impactful in terms of share as well in the 1-gig market? And a quick follow-up to that. Any update we can get on overlap for fiber as it stands exiting the year? And then, on the CBRS build out, obviously, your peer Comcast has been testing along with you for quite a while, but they're live in Philadelphia as perhaps as well as some other markets. Any update on how the team is thinking about CBRS and how you'll perhaps offload strategy over the next several years? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: There's a lot there, Sebastiano. But here we go. So, fixed wireless impact, it is where they've deployed and it's in both fiber and non-fiber overlap. It's more acute in the non-fiber overlap, because it's the first time that somebody's had what they view as an alternative other than DSL. And so, it has a novelty factor in the non-overbuild footprint that is similar to a fiber overbuild that has an immediate short-term impact when it's new into the marketplace. So, it has a more pronounced impact there. But I think the overbuilders, the wireline overbuilders would tell you that fixed wireless access probably has had an impact on them as well. So, it's not that it doesn't have an impact in an overbuild territory. It's just much more pronounced in an area where the overbuild doesn't exist. Our overbuild percentage, in our 10-K today, I think, we disclosed as well that it's roughly 50% in terms of overbuild. And then, as it relates to CBRS, we are fully deployed and active with thousands of radio access networks out on the strand and MDUs in one large market today, and we're expanding into another market at some point this year. And that's going very well. And the pacing of that really is dictated by a few things. One is, our relationship with Verizon is good and strong. The economics are great. And this is an ROI-based deployment. So, it'll be there -- the returns will be there when we deploy. But interestingly, the more penetrated we become, the more attractive the returns get. And so, from a deployment of capital perspective, CBRS is very exciting. It's a very clear mathematical return. But in an environment where we're deploying as much capital as we are and we have so much active activity on the outside plant in terms of high-split upgrade and construction of new networks, we're just pacing it along the way to manage all those factors in the way that we think about deployment of CBRS. But we're going to fully deploy it. It's exciting. It has a great return. The depth at which we employed in each market, it really is a function of utilization on a geographically specific area, and the attractive agreement and the great relationship that we have with Verizon today. So, that's strategic to us. So, all those factors play into the timing.\nSebastiano Petti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That was our last question. I'll now turn the call back over to Stefan Anninger.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, operator. Thanks, everyone. We'll see you next quarter.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you very much.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. In 2023, we added 155,000 Internet customers, and we added nearly 2.5 million Spectrum Mobile lines for growth of nearly 50%. At the end of 2023, we had more than 7.7 million total mobile lines. Only 13% of our Internet customers now have mobile service. And we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years, as the quality and value of our converged connectivity services gains wider recognition. Revenue was up by 1% in 2023, while EBITDA grew by 1.3% and 2.5% when excluding advertising. While we are executing well on our long-term strategic initiatives and Spectrum One is working to drive mobile growth, Internet growth in our existing footprint has been challenging, driven by admittedly more persistent competition from fixed wireless and similar levels of wireline overbuild activity. Small changes in gross additions and churn in a low transaction environment have driven outsized impacts to net gains, which was clearly the case as we moved through the last quarter. I own that. So, let me start with what we believe on the competitive environment and then what we're doing to drive long-term growth by delivering high-quality products and service at a great price. Fixed wireless access: While an inferior product with limited capacity and geographic coverage which is fluid, is often marketed by the phone companies at a perceived lower-priced to their existing customers. We continue to believe the impact from fixed wireless is temporary. Our Internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. Customer bandwidth needs continue to increase. And MNOs will face capacity challenges and will be required to allocate their Spectrum and capital to maintain profitable mobile services. While we can't promise when that happens, I believe bandwidth needs to increase and quality and value win. On the wireline overbuild front, we continue to compete well. Overbuild impact tends to be limited to a few percentage points of Internet penetration during the first year of a new overbuild vintage coming online. It's painful, but it's tied to the pace of overbuild. We don't see overbuilders reaching their penetration and ROI goals now -- within our footprint now or in the future. They don't have the same ubiquitous convergence capabilities as we do, their lower-cost passings have likely been built, some of the planned overbuild was duplicative between operators, meaning less opportunity, and incremental financing cost have increased, putting even more pressure on overbuilder returns. We also expect BEAD passings will provide better capital allocation and ROI for many of these operators. Our assumption is that our competitors are rational economic players with shareholders and balance sheets, which require adequate return on investment. That isn't within our control. So, we are focused on the key strategic initiatives that enhance our long-term competitiveness and growth capabilities, and we expect to return to a more normalized Internet growth over time. Just over a year from when we detailed those initiatives, I wanted to remind everyone of the rationale and update you on their status, as laid out in Slide 4. Our footprint expansion is beating our pacing, penetration, ARPU and ROI targets. New construction will help drive Internet customer growth despite the temporary challenges I mentioned within our existing footprint. 2023 subsidized rural customer growth was already over 100,000. Our penetration also continues to grow at a better-than-expected pace and we'll cover more -- we'll activate more subsidized rural passings this year, both of which Jessica will cover. BEAD will provide additional opportunities, although the potential is uncertain given our concerns regarding how states will apply NTIA guidelines. We'll focus BEAD investments in states where the rules are conducive to private investment. Outside of rural, we also have accelerated greenfield, market fill-in and serviceability builds, expanding our existing footprint in both residential and commercial passings. Penetration curves and returns here are similarly strong and predictable with a lower build cost. We also remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience via our execution initiative, which is intended to enhance frontline employees' tenure while simultaneously investing in digitization, all to drive better sales yields, higher-quality transactions, lower overall service transactions and higher levels of customer satisfaction. Our targeted investments in employees over the last two years resulted in a significant reduction in employee attrition in 2023. Our investments in the digitization of service is also driving efficiencies. In 2024, we have a number of new automated platforms that are launching to facilitate better service for customers and better digital and AI tools for agents to enhance service quality and the quality of their day-to-day jobs. And finally, our evolution initiative, which includes our network evolution project, our convergence efforts, and video product development all remain on course. We fully launched symmetrical speed tiers in two markets and currently launching in six more, completing our step one markets. We'll also begin to work in our step two markets with DAA later this year. Excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. And we expect to complete the project in 2026, so fast, ubiquitous, low-cost upgrade of our capabilities, which our competitors can't replicate. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and grow. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like mobile speed boost and the Spectrum Mobile network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotion and at retail. And Spectrum One customers reaching their first anniversary are performing ahead of our expectations. We'll continue to evolve our converged offering in 2024 with additional features and capabilities. Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product, in October, we launched the Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the U.S., Xumo is our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're approaching 1 million deployed Xumo boxes since launch and we've been getting great customer feedback, and we can keep improving our attach rates. In early January, Disney+ became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost. And in the next several months, ESPN+ and ViX, a Spanish language DTC product, will both become available to certain TV Select customers at no extra cost. This new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers and we plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal. That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or Charter to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. Our new hybrid distribution model, combined with Xumo's content-forward interface, provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value and utility with seamless linear, DTC and SVOD integration and advanced search and discovery functionality. When we reflect on our key initiatives and what we believe are the short-term market challenges, we're acting as long-term Charter shareholders to maximize value. So, we have a posture of expectancy and excitement for the opportunity to execute on initiatives that enhance our long-term growth rate and value for Charter shareholders. In the short term, we are leaving no stone unturned as it relates to our go-to-market approach. Ultimately, the speed at which we can return to a more normalized broadband growth rate hinges on the assumption that our competitors' capital is not limitless for poor ROI projects and, frankly, our execution on our strategic initiatives. So, we're keeping our heads down and executing on a clear strategy to ensure we can offer customers the best products and services across our entire footprint, all while saving customers money, not only now, but in the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Good. So, in terms of the competitive environment in the fourth quarter, as you mentioned, we saw some continued expansion of fixed wireless footprint within the quarter. We also saw heavier competitive marketing and some aggressive promotions from both fixed wireless and from the overbuilders. And as you know, Jonathan, slight impacts to gross adds and churn, in this case, it was particularly on the gross adds front, can drive what appear to be outsized changes to net adds, especially when net adds are slightly positive or slightly negative, really has an outsized impact. As you know, we're, of course, focused very much on the long term, but that doesn't mean that we're not focused on the short term either, particularly what was going on inside of the fourth quarter. And so, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're really leaving no stone unturned on potential ways to improve go-to-market in the short term, particularly addressing gross adds in the existing footprint. We're doing all that though, looking at all aspects, but trying to make sure that we do that in a controlled fashion and don't overreact either given that it is small changes that are driving an outsized impact here. So maybe I'll start off with ACP and just take a step back, and then Jessica can answer what you were requesting. ACP program, I think as everybody knows, it really has brought Internet connectivity to customers who would not have been able to have access to broadband otherwise. But more importantly, it's allowed customers who would have been coming in and out of the broadband marketplace given affordability issues to remain connected consistently. So, we really think, as you know, it's been an effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. We still -- we're hopeful that the ACP can be refunded in order to keep households that are in the program today connected to the Internet. But if it's not refunded, Craig, we're going to work very hard to keep customers connected. And we've been working on this possibility for some time. We have significant tools to save customers hundreds or even thousands of dollars, as Jessica mentioned. And I'd highlight that, keep in mind, most of our ACP customers were Internet customers before the ACP program began. And in the meantime, having said all that, it's actually pretty challenging for us to predict the impact that a potential end of the program is going to have to our customer disconnects, but we're going to report that consistently over time. In the end, we're still focused on trying to make sure that ACP is refunded, and I still think there's a strong possibility that could be the case. Sure. So, we noted the same thing that you saw, Craig. I think the bigger point there is that there is a rational approach to the marketplace and the utilization of Spectrum. And I believe a recognition that there's a limited amount of capacity, the bandwidth needs are increasing. I think that was the bigger takeaway from us. It's very difficult for us to sit back and take a look at the geographic footprint of fixed wireless access because it almost changes by the day in terms of sector availability on radius in terms of capacity and where they're actively marketing and where they're not. And then, you have the additional rural footprint versus urban and suburban, and what would be off-footprint for us versus on-footprint and the split between residential and commercial, which makes it pretty difficult to mathematically cascade that into an impact for us. But I thought it was rational what we said, and I thought it made a lot of sense, and I think it's consistent with what we've always thought. Frankly, the piece that's been more difficult is just the timing in terms of where that capacity is reached, and it's been a little bit harder to predict than we would like. But I took that as the same way that you did that it should have some positive impact on our existing footprint. Sure. So, Ben, I think leading into the last earnings call, we had been listening to shareholder feedback about the difficulty people were having of projecting long-term CapEx trends given the significant capital investment opportunities that we have. And you're right, typically, we would never provide a multiyear outlook and we've -- about the only guidance that we've historically provided is in-year CapEx guidance. But these are unique opportunities that don't come around very often. The opportunity to have subsidized rural build, having the largest expansion of broadband and cable footprint really since the 1980s is unique and it's generational. And I think we felt that investors needed to see, A, the size and magnitude of what we were already committed to, and B, to have a very articulated outline of the returns of those investments, which Jessica has provided. We've been providing that, all that information is essentially what we provided over the past two years, but to do it in a single spot so people could wrap their heads around both the quantum that exist, the investment returns that are attached to that investment and that it doesn't go on into perpetuity, and that there is a real nice setup for what this is all about, which is free cash flow growth. And so, while we typically like to keep our cards close to our chest to preserve both flexibility and to maintain our competitive posture, I felt there was a trade-off here to make sure that our shareholders were with us and that people understood the value of the returns to the investment that we're making. And so, there's a balance here between, on one hand, having the flexibility to always make the right decisions to generate long-term free cash flow, and making sure that we're responsive to shareholder feedback along the way and that we can demonstrate the long-term value, so people take comfort with that. In terms of the prioritization of line extensions over the DAA or DOCSIS 4 upgrade, it wasn't so much about prioritization. It was really about certification of the DAA equipment taking a little bit longer, which was pushing out the timeline for the rollout. And so, the trade-off we had is could you do it the 1.2 gigahertz high-split upgrade under, what we call, an integrated CMTS environment. And do more of that footprint to keep the original pace or should we slow it down just a tad to make sure that we allowed for a catch-up of the DAA certification process so that you can move to high split with distributed access architecture as well as the 1.8 gigahertz and the rollout of DOCSIS 4.0, we chose the latter to make sure that we were having as much of the footprint with the full capabilities of DOCSIS 4.0 over time. The caveat is, if we get into couple of years from now, we see opportunities to pull capital forward. We'll of course do that, but this is our best view of where we're going to spend capital. And we thought it was worthwhile to show that to make sure people understand that it doesn't -- that higher level of capital expenditure doesn't go on into perpetuity. Thanks, Ben. Sure. In broadband, our fundamental view hasn't changed that in the long term, keeping your prices as low as you can both enhances your ability to grow, and that's still our long-term objective, it reduces churn, and it reduces the likelihood that somebody views you as an attractive overbuilt candidate. So, our fundamental views haven't changed. Having said that, we've had inflationary pressures, and we've been passing that through to the best of our ability. To the extent that our pricing is lower and it is for the most part across the industry, I view that as a positive long-term capacity question and from an ability to grow. But it doesn't mean that we're immune to inflation. It doesn't mean that we're not willing to pass-through increases as we need to. And there's a balance here as well that in an environment where we're investing so much into expansion and making sure that we do maintain EBITDA growth rate so that we can keep that engine going, it matters to us and it matters to our shareholders, and we're focused on that in parallel. So, there's a balance that's taking place. And I think we're in a not only in a good position overall, but I think a very good relative position. In terms of the overall market, you've seen different operators across the sector moving their prices up over time as well. And I think that demonstrates that there's real value to the product, and there's a need to recover cost along the way. It's a capital-intensive business. And then, your last question on -- John, is mobile churn.

And I think it has the ability not just to reduce churn, which it's already doing today, but to actually drive acquisition over time. And so, we're early on, but still very exciting. And then, in terms of the penetration, Peter, there's very different types of build that sits in there. I mean, serviceability, which is where a customer calls us effectively for a one-off or two or three additional line extensions, the penetration on that is 85%, as it should be. And other areas where greenfield or market fill-in where penetrations can range anywhere between 45% and 70%, at a lower cost per passing, as Jessica highlighted, than some of the other extension build that we do. So, the returns are very, very attractive. They always have been. There's nothing really new there.

But in an environment where we're deploying as much capital as we are and we have so much active activity on the outside plant in terms of high-split upgrade and construction of new networks, we're just pacing it along the way to manage all those factors in the way that we think about deployment of CBRS. But we're going to fully deploy it. It's exciting. It has a great return. The depth at which we employed in each market, it really is a function of utilization on a geographically specific area, and the attractive agreement and the great relationship that we have with Verizon today. So, that's strategic to us. So, all those factors play into the timing. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 61,000 Internet customers in the fourth quarter, while video customers declined by 257,000. In mobile, we added 546,000 mobile lines, and wireline voice customers declined by 251,000. Our Spectrum One product continued to perform well. Customers that signed up for our Spectrum One product in the fourth quarter of 2022 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Those promotional roll-offs didn't drive incremental Internet churn. In the quarter, we had slightly lower mobile line gross adds year-over-year tied to Internet gross additions with a lower churn rate year-over-year and flat sequentially. We continue to see healthy data usage at our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines will perform well as long-term customers. Turning to rural. We ended the year with 420,000 subsidized rural passings and grew those passings by 295,000 in 2023, in-line with our target, and by 105,000 in the fourth quarter alone, an acceleration from this 78,000 we activated during the third quarter. Customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint also accelerated, with 34,000 net customer additions in the quarter. As Slide 13 shows, we're generating customer penetrations of close to 50% in cohorts that have reached or passed the 12-month mark. In 2024, we expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings, about 50% more than in 2023, with seasonality in the first quarter tied to the winter weather. Slide 12 shows that so far, with additional state bids that we expect, we will have committed to build approximately 1.75 million subsidized rural passings. We also expect our RDOF build to be completed by end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to financial results, starting on Slide 7. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.3%, with video-only customer churn, partly offset by new customer growth driven by Internet. Residential revenue per customer relationship was up 0.1% year-over-year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, mostly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base. As Slide 7 shows, in total, residential revenue was flat year-over-year. Residential Internet ARPU grew by 2.2% year-over-year, but by 3.4% when excluding the impact of Spectrum One GAAP revenue allocation out of Internet into mobile. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.7% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.5% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 6.1%. Fourth quarter advertising revenue declined by 23.4% or $130 million year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 0.7% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 24.4% year-over-year, driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated fourth quarter revenue was up 0.3% year-over-year and up 1.3% year-over-year when excluding advertising. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, total operating expenses declined by 0.7% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 10.6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 6.8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. For the full year 2024, we expect programming cost per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year with our video package mix being the largest variable. Other cost of revenue increased by 15%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 2.1% year-over-year, driven by additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by productivity improvements, including from 10-year investments, and lower service transactions per customer. Looking forward, I would note that our previous investments related to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer-tenured workforce are now largely complete and service transaction trends are back on trajectory after the programming dispute in September. Sales and marketing costs declined by 1.6%, primarily driven by lower labor costs. Finally, other expenses grew by 1.5%, driven by labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 1.6% year-over-year in the quarter and by 3.6% when excluding advertising. Turning to net income on Slide 9, we generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the fourth quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year, driven by a pension remeasurement loss and higher interest expense, partly offset by a gain on the sale of towers and higher adjusted EBITDA. Turning to Slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.9 billion in the fourth quarter, just below last year's fourth quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $978 million, $50 million higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfields and market sell-in opportunities. Fourth quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.9 billion compared to $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by lower spend on scalable infrastructure and lower spend on CPE due to purchase timing, partly offset by higher spend on upgrade/rebuild, primarily network evolution. For the full year 2023, we spent $11.1 billion. Looking ahead at full year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extensions of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. On Slide 11, we've provided our current expectations for capital spending through the year 2027, excluding any possible line extension spend associated with the BEAD program. The slide divides our spending into three categories: line extensions, network evolution and core CapEx spend. As the slide shows, we expect CapEx spend of just over $12 billion in 2024 to fall to approximately $8 billion by 2027. Our line extension CapEx includes spending for greenfield, market sell-in and serviceability builds from our legacy footprint, driving continued expansion of residential and commercial passings. In turn, our non-rural passings growth should continue to be robust and similar to 2023 growth, subject to the pace of overall housing growth. These passings are natural extensions or pocket fill-ins to our network and have a long track record of low cost per passing and reliable penetration trends to contribute to growth at attractive ROI. We've not included the potential impact of BEAD in the passing figures on Slide 12 or in our CapEx outlook on Slide 11, given the regulatory and bidding uncertainty associated with the program. We don't expect any potential BEAD build subject to acceptable guidelines, as Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025. And similar to our peers and competitors, our success in BEAD will be an overlay to our capital expenditure outlook. Turning to network evolution, where our long-term capital expenditures outlook remains essentially unchanged, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve our network to offer multi-gigabit speeds. Finally, core capital expenditures, which excludes line extensions and network evolution, has remained consistent as a percentage of revenue since 2021. And following the completion of our network evolution initiative, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications. Turning to free cash flow on Slide 14. Free cash flow in the fourth quarter totaled $1.1 billion, a decrease of $75 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by less favorable change in accrued expenses related to capital expenditures, partly offset by an increase in net cash flows from operating activities and a decrease in capital expenditures. Just a brief comment on cash taxes for 2024 before turning to the balance sheet. We currently expect our calendar year 2024 cash tax payments under current legislation to land between $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, depending on a number of factors. We finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principle. In the first weeks of 2024, we redeemed all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured floating rate notes and paid in full all of our outstanding 2024 senior secured notes. So, we no longer have any significant debt maturities due in 2024. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt in the next three years at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $90 million or 2% of that run rate interest expense. As of the end of the fourth quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.42 times, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $1.3 billion at an average price of $419 per share. Before turning the call over to Q&A, I want to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program for Internet and mobile customers. While we still hope the ACP program will be allocated additional funding, we're well aware that the program could end this spring, and we're designing programs to assist those that are on the ACP program. There is no doubt that the end of the program would be disruptive for many. Nonetheless, we will have the full benefit of our high-quality sales and retention force as well as our mobile product, which saves customers hundreds of dollars to preserve connections. With the continued temporary impact from fixed wireless and the potential end of ACP, we may continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds as we enter 2024. Despite those short-term challenges, we are competing well and are focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024. A component of that has been to reflect inflation in our pricing while preserving value to our customers. We're also actively managing expenses, and we believe we can do so without impacting our sales, service and broader growth initiatives. But most importantly, we remain focused on long term and a return to more normalized Internet growth. We have what we believe are the best products at the best prices in our industry and we remain underpenetrated relative to our long-term potential. Taking advantage of that opportunity is what will ultimately create the most shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yeah. And I'd add on, the environment wasn't consistent through the quarter. Early on, we had some carryover from the Disney dispute in the August rate event that we talked about in last quarter's call. We had expected November and December to recover to the levels that we had seen going into that event, and they didn't. But as we exited the quarter, we saw December slightly negative, and January net adds are consistent with what we saw in December. So that environment does continue. On the cash tax side, Jonathan, it's not just bonus, it's also R&D and interest expense deductions that will impact us. But I would say the reforms that are being considered support the economics of our investments in connecting rural America and upgrading the network. And so, we are fully in support of them. I think it's a little premature to adjust our guidance. But given the investments that we're making, we do expect there to be a material benefit to cash taxes if the legislation were to go through. Yeah. So, on the numbers side, Craig, we have a little over 5 million households that received the ACP benefit, all for wireline Internet. Very few of those customers used ACP to upgrade to higher speeds or take more PSUs when they began receiving the benefit. But many do have our flagship speed or higher or do take other services from us. And I guess, the funding will continue through April. We'll try to keep people informed as we move through the process. But from our perspective, there's not a lot of visibility at this point as to anything that might happen when the program ends. Yes. Do you want to talk to the fixed wireless lower net add guidance? Yeah. On the EBITDA performance inside of 2024, I guess -- I'm not going to give EBITDA guidance, but I think we can talk about the few things. So, you do have a political advertising year, that is a tailwind. We have -- so we've fully lapped the investments that we made in the employee population. And from an expense outlook perspective, I think my expectation is that we'll be able to keep cost to serve essentially flat on an absolute basis. And in sales and marketing, you might have some growth, but it will be small in the 2% to 3% range. And we continue -- as I said in my remarks, we're taking a look at expenses all across the business to identify areas where we can be more efficient and reduce costs without impacting our service levels and our sales capability. And so, we fully understand that we need to maintain EBITDA growth in this environment and strong EBITDA growth coming into what, as you note, should be a stronger year in order to be able to continue focusing on what we want for the long term, which is to be able to invest to grow in the long term and to return to that sort of Internet customer growth in the long term. So, I think the dynamics in the background are happening to make that growth happen. That's where we are. Yeah. So, I'll start with ARPU. When you look at average revenue per customer overall, John, the biggest factor that's keeping it flat is the rate of video penetration. So, what matters there is the extent to which we can retain video customers with some of the package and pricing strategies that we have. If you isolate and you sort of pull out Internet ARPU, you can see even in the remarks that I made on the quarter that Internet ARPU continues to grow, and when you pull out the Spectrum One Mobile allocation, continues to grow at a rate that's consistent or even a little higher than historical level. On the mobile side, I talked about it on the last call. As you have -- so because we've sort of lapsed the free line offer, the number of free lines that we have in the system over the course of 2024 is more steady than it was in 2023. So, you'll also see that the impact of that mobile allocation over to the Internet should steady over time. And you'll have, just as a matter of math, more paying customers in the base as a proportion relative to the free lines. So, I think that's the piece there. I don't know, Chris, do you want to talk about pricing power? Yeah. So, I'll start on the cost per passing question. What you see there is related to the mix between commercial and even enterprise passings and residential passing. So, the cost per resi passing that lives inside of that is closer to $1,500. What's happening is that there are, I'm going to say, a smaller number, but a larger dollar amount of commercial passings that are included in the mix that drive the average cost per passing to be a little bit higher. And we're just trying to give enough information there to get you to a reasonable passings estimate so that -- so you can model off of that what gains you would generate from the build. Yeah. And... We mentioned the less than 50% -- or the 50% or so at about the 12-month-plus mark. But as you can see and what we provided and all of the cohorts that we are seeing, we're still growing at a good rate at that point. So, it's not as though you've reached the customers who are going to get your product and then we're not seeing additional growth. We're still seeing good growth in those markets even at that vantage."

Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. During the third quarter, we added 63,000 Internet customers, as we continue to benefit from growth in both our existing footprint and new subsidized rural footprint. We also added nearly 600,000 Spectrum mobile lines, benefiting from our Spectrum One offering. At the end of the third quarter, we had over 7 million total mobile lines, and over 12% of our Internet customers now have mobile service. We expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years as the quality and the value of our converged connectivity service gains wider recognition. Revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, with some temporary headwinds within the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA grew at 0.7% year-over-year, moving past the low point last quarter. We expect that upward trend to continue as we realize the benefit of our operating investments. More importantly, we're making significant progress against the multiyear strategic initiatives we outlined late last year. Our footprint expansion initiative remains on track. We expect to add approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2023 and to accelerate that pace in 2024. Our penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better-than-expected pace. At the 12-month mark, our rural builds are achieving nearly 50% penetration, faster than our initial expectations. Our execution initiative also continues to progress, and we remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in employee tenure and training, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms for both customers and employees will further reduce transactions, driving higher levels of customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction, driving tenure and quality. And finally, our evolution initiative, which is comprised of our network evolution project, our convergence efforts and our video product transformation, all of which remain on track. Our network evolution project continues to progress well and will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of customers and competitors everywhere we operate. Unlike the telcos, which prioritize the most attractive footprints for upgrades, our multi-gig speed offerings will be available across our entire footprint. Our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter. And excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. We're very much on target. Whether we finish our network evolution initiative by the end of 2025 or mid-2026 will really depend on the supply chain for distributed access architecture components and managing annual capital spend, given the larger customer growth opportunity and construction speed of RDOF, where we're ahead of the build requirements and we'll end up with more passings than originally expected, state grants, and hopefully, beat passings. However, I want to reiterate and be very clear that where state BEAD rules are not conducive to private investment, we will not participate in those states. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and succeed. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity, with differentiated features like mobile Speed Boost and the Spectrum Mobile Network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers, with market-leading pricing at both promotion and retail. Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product. Earlier this month, we launched our Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear and VPD streaming service in the US, Xumo is now our go-to-market platform for new video sales. In September, we announced an agreement to carry Disney's linear networks and direct-to-consumer services for our customers. This new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers and we believe a significant step forward for the video ecosystem. For Charter, the agreement adds value to our video packages and better aligns linear content and DTC apps, which will be included for free in our video products. We also maintained flexibility to offer lower cost packages. Disney gets broader distribution of its DTC products with ad revenues from our video customers and upgrade subscriptions to ad free. We'll also sell Disney's DTC apps to our Internet customers, including via Xumo over time. Together with Disney, we created a glide path to bridge from linear video into new growth with both linear and DTC services. Disney and ESPN were a key first step to repairing the video ecosystem, but our goal is to have a product that is valuable and that we're proud to sell. We plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal in a way that works for customers. That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or us to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. If programmers insist on customers paying twice, we just won't carry those channels. But we'd still be happy to sell their content in an \u00e0 la carte app, same way as they do. Our goal is to modernize these agreements quietly and seamlessly for our mutual customer base. Our new hybrid distribution model, combined with Xumo's content forward interface, provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value, and utility, with seamless linear DTC and SVOD integration in advanced search and discovery functionality. For Charter and programmers, this creates a state-of-the-art video marketplace, supported by our scaled distribution, sales, and service infrastructure, and we believe a glide path to broader distribution, better economics, and more choice for everyone. Through expansion, network evolution, convergence, video transformation, and investing in quality, we are executing successfully the strategy we laid out last December. Our strategy remains to provide the highest quality products, which we then priced and packaged in customer-friendly ways to drive higher penetration of our services across our footprint. We then combined that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers. Ultimately, continued execution of our strategy will drive significant long-term value for shareholders, and we continue to make good progress. Before handing the call over to Jessica, I want to note that earlier this week, we announced Ton Rutledge's plan of retirement, and that Eric Zinterhofer is reassuming the non-Executive Chairman role at Charter. I'm pleased that Tom will remain as Director Emeritus, and grateful to Tom, Eric and our full Board, including two of the most successful cable investors in Liberty Media and Advanced New House, for their work to achieve a smooth CEO transition for Charter. Jessica?\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 63,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. We estimate that approximately 15,000 third quarter Internet disconnects were driven by the temporary loss of ESPN in September. Video customers declined by 327,000 in the third quarter, with about 100,000 video disconnects driven by the Disney programming dispute. The overall impact to customer relationships was less than we expected, facilitated in part by the wide availability of over-the-top alternative. The loss of Disney programming occurred both at the beginning of football season and in the midst of a programming cost pass-through and the launch of our new Auto Pay discount incentive on Internet. Nonetheless, operationally, we handled the Disney dispute very well. But our billing and retention call centers were not fully back to normal until early October, so there was lingering customer net add impact early in the fourth quarter. Turning to mobile. We added 594,000 mobile lines in the third quarter. Wireline voice customers declined by 286,000 in the third quarter. Overall market activity, churn and gross adds, remained well below pre-COVID levels, partly driven by persistently low move rates. We continue to compete well in a portion of our footprint that is overlapped by fiber, but we also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the lower usage and price-sensitive customer segments of our residential and SMB businesses. That product remains slower and less reliable than what we can deliver, and will be additionally constrained as consumers demand more and more data. In fact, high data usage customers that switched to fixed wireless have a higher propensity to return to our Internet service. Despite our Disney dispute, third quarter residential Internet churn was at a new record low for the third quarter. Our Spectrum Mobile product also continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers has continued to increase. Boarding from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions grew year-over-year, despite much higher mobile sales. We also continue to see healthy data usage on our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines should perform well as long-term customers. In the third quarter of last year, we launched Spectrum One pilot programs in a handful of markets. The pilot program customers reached their 12-month anniversary during the third quarter of this year, and incremental churn on those lines was small and even less than we expected. Turning to rural. Subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the third quarter, with 78,000 passings activated. And we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. As our RDOF build has progressed, we have identified roughly 300,000 adjacent passings along the way that are not in the sense of slot groups we want, but we will add to our network as we complete the RDOF build. Because of these adjacent passings, we now expect that our RDOF initiative will yield a total of 1.3 million passings to be constructed over a multiyear period. And while labor and equipment costs have both increased, we expect the average net cost per passing of these 1.3 million passings to be similar to our original RDOF net cost per passing estimate. We don't expect any potential BEAD build, subject to what Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025. Moving to financial results, starting on slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet, partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.6% year-over-year, given a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base and $63 million of residential customer credits related to the Disney lockout, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year. As slide 6 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue grew by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 1.3% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.5%. Third quarter advertising revenue declined by 20.3% or $97 million year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 1.8%, due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 28.8% year-over-year, driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year, and up 1.5% year-over-year when excluding advertising and the impact of the $68 million in total Disney-related customer credits. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 7. In the third quarter, total operating expenses were approximately flat year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 6% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages and a $61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in early September. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. We now expect that for the full year 2023, programming cost per video customer will decline by approximately 3% year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 15.2%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by previous adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Those were partly offset by productivity improvements, including from tenure investments, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. Sales and marketing costs declined by 1.4%, primarily driven by lower labor costs, as we've lapped our prior year employee investments in sales and marketing. Overall, while we certainly had some additional overtime in our call centers, given the Disney dispute, it was not a material expense driver this quarter. Finally, other expenses grew by 2.5%, driven by labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on slide 8. We generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, up from $1.2 billion last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower other operating expense, partly offset by higher interest expense. Turning to slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $3 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $2.4 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on upgrade rebuild due to our network evolution initiative, higher spend on line extensions driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunities, and higher CPE, driven by the purchase of Xumo devices for our launch earlier this month. For the full year 2023, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $11.2 billion. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, should total approximately $7.2 billion, higher than our previous expectation. The increase reflects additional Xumo CPE purchases and an acceleration of network spend related to future high split markets, including inventory accumulation and other preparation activities like walk-out and design and proactive equipment swap-outs of both DTAs and MPEG2 boxes. As Chris noted, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve the network to offer multiple gigabit speeds. There has been no change to our longer-term network evolution CapEx outlook. We also continue to expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to total approximately $4 billion. We are working through our 2024 operating plan right now. Given the greater subsidized rural passings and construction opportunity we currently see, we may partially fund that opportunity by very modestly slowing our network evolution plan, as Chris mentioned. And as we complete our 2024 plans, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter 2023 call in January. I want to highlight that capital expenditures, excluding line extensions and network evolution as a percentage of total revenue, have remained consistent since 2021. And following the completion of our network evolution initiative, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow this quarter versus $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx, mostly driven by our network evolution and expansion initiatives. A couple of brief comments on working capital and cash taxes before turning to the balance sheet. Excluding the impact of mobile devices, we now expect our full year 2023 change in working capital to be negative by a few hundred million dollars, given the timing of capital expenditures and lower-than-expected accrued programming at year-end. On cash taxes, we did have a lower cash tax payment in the third quarter, which is just a timing difference. The full year cash tax outlook, which I provided during our fourth quarter 2022 call, still stand. We finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased two million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $854 million, at an average price of $421 per share. Our 2023 EBITDA growth has been pressured by significant investments we've made in the future growth of our business. As we move toward 2024, pressure on our EBITDA growth will begin to abate, with growing transaction efficiency as we benefit from building employee tenure and easier comps as we have now lapped the impact of those employee investments. Lower transactions in our mobile business, which drove down -- which drive down our per customer cost of service and building as we move into next year, revenue growth acceleration from the roll-off of our mobile free line offers and positive impact from political advertising. In addition, faster pacing of our rural build should bring additional positive impact to customer net additions next year. In the longer term, the competitive impact in operational efficiencies from our network evolution will drive a stronger broadband business. Convergence momentum will improve our churn and generate financial growth for both broadband and mobile, and transformational changes to the video business can enhance the value of our product for our connectivity customers. The investments we have been making and will continue to make are set to drive the growth of our business going forward. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks. Two quick questions. Starting with broadband, it looks like your -- the progress in the new markets, the rural markets that you're pushing into is great. The 12-month penetration there is accelerating, which is fantastic. But it seems like the core markets are progressing a little bit more slowly than you expected. And I'm wondering, Chris, if you can give us some context for what was different from what you may be expecting in the core markets as sort of function of just slower pull-through from Spectrum One, or greater pressures from fixed wireless broadband or something else? And then I'm wondering, sort of, taking a step back, whether you can give us a view of what you think the video business ultimately looks like five years down the line? I can imagine an environment, a world where you're collecting a platform fee, this lower ARPU, but very high margin from a large number of your customers, and it becomes a much more valuable business for you than the sort of the distribution business that you have today. But I would love to get your thoughts on like how that business evolves? And when we sort of hit the point where it starts to become a growth driver for you as opposed to a drag on growth? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. And there's a lot in what you just asked, broadband. So, as you mentioned, our subsidized rural construction is going very well and it's pacing well. We're getting faster penetration than we anticipated, probably are used for higher terminal penetration. As Jessica mentioned, as we get into next year, not only do we have the accelerated pace of construction that we get into Q4 and then into next year, but also the tailwind of the construction that we've already completed. So, as a standalone investment, the transparency around that is actually pretty high. The core markets, I think similar to what you've heard probably from others, both in the second quarter as well as third quarter, the back-to-school and dynamics, both at disconnect in Q2 and reconnected Q3 is not gotten back to where it was several years ago. Some of that could tie into the low end of the market where you have some incremental fixed wireless access. I think importantly for us we're continuing well in fiber markets and as it relates to fixed wireless access where you have a lower quality, lower throughput, lower capacity product, that's really not even lower priced when you combine mobile and Internet together. But on the increment, it appears to be that way. We feel pretty good about that space, just given the amount of bandwidth usage that increases over time and the natural capacity constraints that we've all spoken about in the past. So, I think some combination of that, as well as Jessica mentioned, we had a relatively modest, but small impact on the Disney programming dispute, which drove an additional 15,000 units. But just if you step back, for all the reasons that we know, the broadband market has been temporarily stunted for growth. But we are growing in both our existing footprint as well as in the rural subsidized footprint as well and we're providing that so people can evaluate where both pieces are. In terms of video, five years from now, I think there'll still be a traditional video business that exists. And then I'll talk a little bit about where it could evolve to. But a traditional video business that exists, hopefully with additional value in it with DTCs, bundled in, in a way that increases the stickiness of the linear business, is just to the benefit of our ourselves and programmers, we can do that through these renovated agreements with the programmers and the combination of Xumo that creates utility for customers to find content in an easier way and have a deeper library and availability of that content. I do think, as you mentioned and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have an opportunity to evolve to a state-of-the-art video marketplace where we can provide that type of traditional linear integrated DTC and SVOD product for customers who can afford it. It's a value. But when you get that, it's a very valuable product, and it's something that we'd be proud of. And for those customers who are going to be coming more in and out of the video market with different packages because of affordability, that's been driven by the programmers and because of the availability of DTC's \u00e0 la carte, that Xumo, for us, can provide a really good marketplace to sell those products, again, for the benefit of the programmers as well and gives customers options wherever they want to go. And to your point, not only do we have the traditional video business delivered by Spectrum, but we also have the ability to monetize, from an advertising revenue perspective, the platform through our equity investment in the 50-50 joint venture of Xumo. So nobody sitting here forecasting that traditional linear video is going to grow. But I do think it still remains very important to our connectivity relationships. I think we have a strategic advantage in the marketplace because of our capabilities as a broadband provider with a scaled video platform with the programming relationships that we have and the ability to package together a hybrid model that creates value for customers and is also a distribution engine for these DTC apps, either on a standalone or a bundled basis, for customers and programmers in the future. So if I step back from a video perspective, again, I'm not forecasting growth, but the past 15 years, there's been very little to be optimistic about, either from a customer perspective because of what the programmers have done or for ourselves as a distributor. And for the first time, I see a path where we can create value for customers and create utility and that ultimately will enhance the value of the connectivity services that we provide through our seamless connectivity in Spectrum One, which we're beginning to market now as part of Xumo.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. We\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. You may unmute and ask your question.\nCraig Moffett: Hi, thank you. I wonder, maybe for Jessica, if we could drill down a little bit on the ARPU impact of Spectrum One? And how we should expect, as you start to see the first cohorts roll off, how should we expect ARPU to track for both broadband and for wireless, I guess, over the next not just the next quarter or so, but maybe a little bit longer term as you start to roll off those cohorts?\nJessica Fischer: Sure. Thanks, Craig. So I'm going to start on the wireless side, and then I'll come back and hit the Internet side. On the wireless side, our rate of net additions, it's been not perfectly steady, but fairly steady over the last four quarters now, with Spectrum One in place. And so as you lap and have the roll-off of those free lines that were in the fourth quarter of last year, and you create new free lines in the fourth quarter of this year, what I would say is that the impact that the free lines have on overall ARPU, it ceases to become a pressure on ARPU. And as the free lines as a portion make up a smaller and smaller percentage of the total lines, over time, because the base is growing underneath them and the number of free lines sort of stabilizes, I think that you do have a little bit of remaining -- or you could have a little bit of positive pressure on ARPU. The other side of that, we do still have some legacy pricing in the mix that has to roll off. So probably on wireless, more stabilized next year. If you think about what the impact is that it's having on Internet, so Internet ARPU growth, if you sort of look at it at a product ARPU level, gap growth in the year-over-year was 2.6%. Without the Spectrum One mobile allocation in there, it would have been 3.7%. So you have about a 1.1% difference in product line ARPU growth that relates to that allocation from the fee line. As those free lines start to roll off, I think actually, the dynamic is the same. The total free lines in the system become sort of steady in the year-over-year. So that mobile allocation becomes steady as you get into Q4. So, there is the potential then that what you see from a GAAP reporting perspective is better ARPU growth on the sort of Internet component, but it's related to just not having the building of that GAAP allocation inside of the Internet product.\nCraig Moffett: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. We will go take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm hoping you could spend a little more time talking about the CapEx outlook and strategy around sort of three buckets: the digital evolution, the line extensions and then Xumo or, I guess, video. It sounds like we should continue to assume about $5.5 billion for the network evolution spend, but it sounds like the timing of that may have moved, maybe some -- maybe less more this year, but less next couple of years, and then more maybe in 2026. I wonder if you could help us there. Is there a change in the $4 billion a year of line extensions from the higher RDOF opportunity that you talked about? And then I don't think you've been spending much at all, I would guess, on video CPE, given recycling of set-tops, et cetera. So, can you fill us in a little bit on the Xumo plan? Because I'm trying to think about whether you're sort of going to be slowly moving your video sub base over time to a whole new equipment fleet, so to speak, and trying to understand what that might look like from a CapEx point of view. So I know that's a lot, but you guys give us a lot to chew on, but I'd ask for some help.\nChris Winfrey: It was our fault, Ben. That's true. Why don't I take two of those, being network evolution -- or start off with two of those network evolution video CPE, and let Jessica take expansion and any gaps that I missed on the first two. On network evolution, we -- I mentioned that we could potentially slow down by, call it, six months. And then the counter to that, obviously, is wait a second, I thought this is improving your competitive standpoint, it is. But I would flag that we're competing. One, it's not that material at a time difference. And two, we're competing well against fiber today. And our goal remains to have a superior speed claims across everywhere we operate in our footprint. That being said, we've always said that we'll accelerate investments wherever we can. And the trade-off to that is we also recognize there is value in showing some discipline to shareholders in terms of the overall envelope capital and these rural investments, which continue to expand both in terms of size and our capabilities to deploy quickly. They produce immediate gains. So when you step back and think about trying to balance both our traditional approach, which is if there's capital returns, capital that can be deployed that has great ROI go as fast as you can, at the same time, balance investor expectations and show discipline there in terms of the overall envelope, a six-month time line, it's not going to make that much difference long-term. There is an additional benefit operationally, which is that an extended time line allows some of our DAA or distributed access architecture suppliers to catch up with the latest technology at full scale so that we can deploy the most advanced gear as part of this wave of high split and DOCSIS -- eventually DOCSIS 4.0 implementation. So, that's my thoughts on network evolution. Jessica can come back in a second and clean up on that, if I missed something. On video CPE, it's -- we have, over time, spent less on video CPE because we've been able to recycle World Box at the initial beginning of deployment for Xumo, we needed to get a starting state inventory of Xumo Boxes, and that's captured in capital. On the increment, we will be deploying more new boxes than we have in the past because we're essentially using Xumo as our go-to-market deployment for video CPE, and that's going very well right now. And -- now the boxes are less expensive than what traditional boxes have been over the past, and we expect the cost of those boxes to continue to decline significantly. So, you'll have a combination of volume, which will be determined by our success, and a lower price point over time as well as lower need to build up inventory through all of our channels and throughout the country. So it's -- there's a step-up there. But long term, I don't expect it to be that material.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So maybe I'll try to help you with some numbers around network evolution and rural. I'm going to caveat it that we're still working through our operating plan for next year. So, I'm not going to give a 2024 guide. But just to help you frame the issue. If you think about where our run rate for rural passings will be in Q4 to reach our 300,000, you have to have 110,000 passings in Q4, which we're actually pretty confident that we will meet. If you take that run rate and sort of push it into four quarters of next year, we would build the 440,000 passing, which is 140,000 more rural patents than what we built this year. We've told you before, and it's true that passings timing isn't perfectly aligned with spend. So it's not a perfect guide. But if you put that at the net cost per passing, the $3,800 that we've talked about for RDOF, it would put the run rate next year on the order of $500 million higher than where we are inside of this year, assuming that all of the other components of line extensions remain the same, which there is a little variability there. But I think it's a good way to think about the issue overall. I think you have to couple that on the other side, with an understanding that network evolution spend sort of like our rural construction, is front loaded. There's a lot of costly preparation and inventory building work that needs to be done before you make it into the field to actually do the high slip or to replace equipment. We expect that we're going to spend a little over $1 billion this year in 2023 on high split, which leaves a substantial a substantial amount of spend in the project and a large portion of which if we continue at our current pace would hit inside of next year. So adjusting the timing of high split won't be enough probably to fully offset the additional line extension spend, but it can help. And as Chris said, we are looking at it sort of in the context of a total package to say, what's an appropriate amount of capital expense load to put against the business given where we sit. No, you're right. I want to say one more thing about it, though. So as we think about all of this investment that we're making in rural, I think it's probably -- we need to drive additional visibility around sort of the value that's related to having sort of unique one-time capital investments like that. We're taking a look at a lot of different ways we could think about that. We consider it a JV, but the returns are so strong. I don't think we want to share them. We've considered a tracking stock. I think structurally, it's complicated, but it does sort of do what I'm thinking about and kind of trying to create focus on the spending on rural as really acquiring passing is more like M&A, instead of thinking about it the way that you would think about CapEx. Absent doing one of those things, I am looking at additional disclosures to create more transparency. And so I think you should look for us to be trying to bring some of those disclosures early next year. And the other way that you can think about it with what's already been built, which I think is easier to sort of wrap your mind around as to what value has been created. Jonathan at New Street actually laid out a nice way to think about sort of what's the value of overall passing once it's built. His number came in around $9,000. And I'm not going to argue with him because I think it's a good space to think about it. So we built 315,000 rural passings so far. At $9,000 per passing, it's around $2.8 billion. Our average net cost per passing on the subsidized rural build is around $3,800. So, you can assume something like $1.6 billion of capital has been spent against those completed passings. And what that means is that we've created value, the current value of the passings at $2.8 billion versus the $1.6 billion that we've spent. We've already created value of $1.8 billion or $1.2 billion related to the building of those passings. And as we continue to accelerate the pace of the build, the pace at which we add that value to our business will increase. So we are looking at additional transparency there and trying to help as we sort of think about what our total capital spend might look like for next year, also making sure that we pair it with good disclosure and help from a valuation perspective so that you can see the value that those are adding to the business as we get them built.\nChris Winfrey: So Ben, you got probably more than you asked for. But Jessica was talking and I step back -- if you step it up one level from that, I think it's important just to reiterate that this company has a very strong focus on long-term capital allocation, long-term shareholder value creation. But we also understand the value of shareholder confidence along the way. And so we're going to go outside of our comfort zone here before we finish our operating plan, try to provide some of that additional disclosure and transparency, and make sure that we've got the full buy-in of our shareholders along the way and demonstrate what we've always been, I think, is really good allocators of capital.\nBen Swinburne: Appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. Luke, we\u2019ll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. Two, if I could. Jessica, you previously talked about cost items, cost to serve and sales and marketing sort of exiting this year close to zero. Obviously, cost of services elevated in the quarter. Can you just talk about where we are on the cost cycle, given you should be comping against some of your labor cost increases? And sort of what it sort of means sort of into 2024? And then Chris, you started mentioned, I think now two quarters in a row, about the BEAD process and the state process and how that may sort of play out and you may not participate kind of thing. Can you sort of talk about really what are the issues there? And if that is the case, are we still too optimistic on your line extension spend over the next few years, which I think is about $4 billion a year?\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So Vijay, first on the cost items, I don't have any change in my expectation relative to cost to serve in sales and marketing, exiting the year at close to zero. And I think we've talked in our remarks, and it is our expectation that as our -- as the tenure in those areas mature, and as we -- because now, as of the end of Q3, we've really lapped the one-time increase related to the investments that we made on the employee side.\nChris Winfrey: For sales and marketing.\nJessica Fischer: Well, as of the end of the quarter, I think you also lapped in cost to serve for the most part. And so the rate of increase -- why I'd say that? So, we should expect to be more efficient across those areas going forward, whether that's sort of every quarter mix. I'm not going to be specific about where we'll be inside of next year and the quarters. But I do think our overall expectation is that from this point, we drive efficiency in those spaces.\nChris Winfrey: Vijay, on BEAD, you talked about pipeline, the BEAD has always been very difficult to forecast exactly what it will be because there's state allocations now, but how much of that is near our footprint. We're working through all of that. It's going to take a long time for that. So, -- and -- but in the meantime, RDOF and the state grants, they're going well. And there's a very large pipeline, as we've talked about, absent BEAD. I think it's fair to say that we were somewhat disappointed in the potential guidelines that came out from NTIA. And all I'm trying to say, without getting too much in the detail, NTIA states are all aware of the issues that we have. But to be clear, the states that adopt the NTIA's proposed guidelines on things such as Internet tiers, dictating Internet tiers, dictating pricing, labor practices, those just won't be attractive state for us to bid in. And so what we will do is we'll focus our investments on the states that allow us to retain flexibility to run the business, properly respond to market demand and ultimately, earn a healthy return. So, that's our focus. And so it's very difficult to forecast what, if any, BEAD investments will occur at this stage. And it's going to take us some time, I think, to figure that out as well as everybody else for that matter. So, we're not unique.\nJessica Fischer: And as we have said all along in rural, we've been extremely disciplined from a financial perspective and looking at the specific passing that we're bidding on to make sure that we're comfortable that it will generate financial returns and all things factor into that, including the limitations that you have under the regulatory environment.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Vijay. Thank you. We'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. You may unmute and ask question.\nPhil Cusick: Thank you. I guess a couple of follow-ups. Jessica, I heard your comment, on October customer addition drag, do you think it's still a reasonable goal for 2023 to add more broadband subs year-over-year? And if not, do you think 4Q of last year is a reasonable proxy for this year? I know you love guidance. And then second, as I'm thinking about your cost commentary as well as maybe some revenue pick up, what is the outlook for EBITDA acceleration from here? We've talked about EBITDA accelerating in the back half, but I'm also thinking about what your Disney content costs are going to do for the fourth quarter. Just how should we think about that from here? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Phil, on the -- let me take the customer one. The -- our goal has been to increase net adds for Internet year-over-year. I think given some of what we've seen just in early October for the reasons that we talked about before, I think it would require a very successful November and December. So I think we're going to be hard-pressed to hit that. I think the underlying trends in the business we've talked about where that sets us up for 2024. And so we're really optimistic about that. But I think it requires a pretty -- a very healthy November and December in order to achieve what was our original goal.\nJessica Fischer: On the EBITDA side, so thinking about what the components are, as you go into Q4 and next year, in Q4, you do still have an advertising headwind and actually the most significant advertising headwind of the year because of political advertising. But as you go into next year, then that turns around where you're back in a political year and you have the benefit of political advertising. As I said earlier, we've sort of lapped the last of our 2022 labor adjustments as at the end of Q3. So I think the trajectory from a cost perspective on cost to serve and sales and marketing is -- it gives -- you have easier comps and you have growing efficiencies sort of going into next year. In the fourth quarter, we'll start gaining revenue from the mobile free line roll-off. It's relatively small inside of Q4, but the impact builds as you go through next year. So we expect to have a good tailwind from that. And then we continue to expect to have just overall efficiency from our 10-year investments across the business. So, as we said, I think that we recognized that EBITDA was challenged in 2023, by both the investments that we're making, doing it in a nonpolitical year. But as we get into Q4 and going into next year, our expectation is that we've pushed through most of that headwind and that we'll be in a better position.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks very much.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. Luke, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. So, you said that some of your initial Spectrum One roll-to-pay results were a little better than expected. Could you just expand on the tools you're employing to drive those retention rates? And what kind of targets you might have in mind for the Spectrum One mobile roll-to-pay as we think about how that retention could look going forward? And is it right to assume that it's about 300,000 lines per quarter that are up for grabs? And then additionally, we've received a lot of questions on the ACP program and what it means for Charter. Could you maybe just help us frame how you see that exposure? Do you think you require any contingency plans in case there's any changes to the political outlook for that? And is there a lot of overlap between ACP customers and Spectrum One customers? Or is that quite a different customer set? Thank you very much.\nChris Winfrey: I'll do my best to answer as much of that as I can. The mobile retention, we're not having to do much of anything at all, simply because these lines are being actively used. They have similar port in rates to what we have elsewhere. They also have similar -- nearly similar device purchase rate. So they are real customers, they are looking very much like any other existing customer.  When they roll tier from a $0 price point for the first line, many of them are paying for a second line. But they go from a first line at $0 to $30, and that product is the fastest mobile product in the country, and it's providing it at the lowest rate relative to that speed. So, at $30, you can't replicate that mobile product anywhere else in the country that's producing that speed. And then all-in, when you think about it from a convergence standpoint, it's a product that has a structural advantage that's difficult for anyone else to replicate. So, we do have some small tactics around the edge that we can do to retain customers under different circumstances, but that's not being heavily used at this point, simply because it's sticking. On ACP, for the benefit of the broader audience, that's the affordable connectivity program. This program, federal program, it's brought Internet connectivity to customers who really wouldn't have access to broadband otherwise. And -- it's also allow existing customers who would have been coming in and out of the broadband marketplace really given the affordability issues, to remain connected consistently. So, I think we think it's been a really effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. Just this week, I understand the White House has asked Congress to authorize more money for ACP earlier. And I hope that Congress will fund it before running out next year. Now, you asked the question, what happens to the extent it's not funded? Just as I mentioned, most of these customers receive -- that received ACP support today were Internet customers before the program was founded. We have low-income broadband programs that existed before ACP began and because of the value we provide in that connectivity, I do think that we'll continue to retain these customers. We have ways where they're moving them into the lower speed products that we have to be able to save the money more importantly, if you think about the mobile build the vast majority of these customers have inside their home, we can save them hundreds or even thousands of dollars every year, even though ACP disappeared simply by moving them over to our mobile. So, we have a lot of tools available to us for these customers to make sure that they stay. I hope is that we don't need to go down that path. I hope is that we can still save them that money by kind of getting them on to Spectrum Mobile and Spectrum One. But I'm hopeful that the program, which has been very successful, gets successfully renewed.\nStefan Anninger: And that concludes our call. Thanks very much, everybody. \nChris Winfrey: Thank you all. Appreciate it.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. During the third quarter, we added 63,000 Internet customers, as we continue to benefit from growth in both our existing footprint and new subsidized rural footprint. We also added nearly 600,000 Spectrum mobile lines, benefiting from our Spectrum One offering. At the end of the third quarter, we had over 7 million total mobile lines, and over 12% of our Internet customers now have mobile service. We expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years as the quality and the value of our converged connectivity service gains wider recognition. Revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, with some temporary headwinds within the quarter. And adjusted EBITDA grew at 0.7% year-over-year, moving past the low point last quarter. We expect that upward trend to continue as we realize the benefit of our operating investments. More importantly, we're making significant progress against the multiyear strategic initiatives we outlined late last year. Our footprint expansion initiative remains on track. We expect to add approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2023 and to accelerate that pace in 2024. Our penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better-than-expected pace. At the 12-month mark, our rural builds are achieving nearly 50% penetration, faster than our initial expectations. Our execution initiative also continues to progress, and we remain committed to prioritizing the customer experience. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in employee tenure and training, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms for both customers and employees will further reduce transactions, driving higher levels of customer satisfaction and employee satisfaction, driving tenure and quality. And finally, our evolution initiative, which is comprised of our network evolution project, our convergence efforts and our video product transformation, all of which remain on track. Our network evolution project continues to progress well and will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of customers and competitors everywhere we operate. Unlike the telcos, which prioritize the most attractive footprints for upgrades, our multi-gig speed offerings will be available across our entire footprint. Our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter. And excluding the benefit of any savings that result from the project, we continue to expect our network evolution to cost a very low $100 per passing. We're very much on target. Whether we finish our network evolution initiative by the end of 2025 or mid-2026 will really depend on the supply chain for distributed access architecture components and managing annual capital spend, given the larger customer growth opportunity and construction speed of RDOF, where we're ahead of the build requirements and we'll end up with more passings than originally expected, state grants, and hopefully, beat passings. However, I want to reiterate and be very clear that where state BEAD rules are not conducive to private investment, we will not participate in those states. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve and succeed. Spectrum One is performing well and offers the fastest connectivity, with differentiated features like mobile Speed Boost and the Spectrum Mobile Network. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers, with market-leading pricing at both promotion and retail. Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product. Earlier this month, we launched our Xumo platform across our entire footprint. This industry-leading video platform allows our customers to access their linear and direct-to-consumer video content with unified search and discovery within one easy-to-use interface. Combined with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear and VPD streaming service in the US, Xumo is now our go-to-market platform for new video sales. In September, we announced an agreement to carry Disney's linear networks and direct-to-consumer services for our customers. This new hybrid distribution model is good for consumers and we believe a significant step forward for the video ecosystem. For Charter, the agreement adds value to our video packages and better aligns linear content and DTC apps, which will be included for free in our video products. We also maintained flexibility to offer lower cost packages. Disney gets broader distribution of its DTC products with ad revenues from our video customers and upgrade subscriptions to ad free. We'll also sell Disney's DTC apps to our Internet customers, including via Xumo over time. Together with Disney, we created a glide path to bridge from linear video into new growth with both linear and DTC services. Disney and ESPN were a key first step to repairing the video ecosystem, but our goal is to have a product that is valuable and that we're proud to sell. We plan to modernize all of our distribution agreements upon renewal in a way that works for customers. That means packaging flexibility, value and not asking customers or us to pay twice for similar DTC and linear programming. If programmers insist on customers paying twice, we just won't carry those channels. But we'd still be happy to sell their content in an a\u0300 la carte app, same way as they do. Our goal is to modernize these agreements quietly and seamlessly for our mutual customer base. Our new hybrid distribution model, combined with Xumo's content forward interface, provides a clear path to solve key customer issues of choice, value, and utility, with seamless linear DTC and SVOD integration in advanced search and discovery functionality. For Charter and programmers, this creates a state-of-the-art video marketplace, supported by our scaled distribution, sales, and service infrastructure, and we believe a glide path to broader distribution, better economics, and more choice for everyone. Through expansion, network evolution, convergence, video transformation, and investing in quality, we are executing successfully the strategy we laid out last December. Our strategy remains to provide the highest quality products, which we then priced and packaged in customer-friendly ways to drive higher penetration of our services across our footprint. We then combined that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers. Ultimately, continued execution of our strategy will drive significant long-term value for shareholders, and we continue to make good progress. Before handing the call over to Jessica, I want to note that earlier this week, we announced Ton Rutledge's plan of retirement, and that Eric Zinterhofer is reassuming the non-Executive Chairman role at Charter. I'm pleased that Tom will remain as Director Emeritus, and grateful to Tom, Eric and our full Board, including two of the most successful cable investors in Liberty Media and Advanced New House, for their work to achieve a smooth CEO transition for Charter. Jessica? Sure. And there's a lot in what you just asked, broadband. So, as you mentioned, our subsidized rural construction is going very well and it's pacing well. We're getting faster penetration than we anticipated, probably are used for higher terminal penetration. As Jessica mentioned, as we get into next year, not only do we have the accelerated pace of construction that we get into Q4 and then into next year, but also the tailwind of the construction that we've already completed. So, as a standalone investment, the transparency around that is actually pretty high. The core markets, I think similar to what you've heard probably from others, both in the second quarter as well as third quarter, the back-to-school and dynamics, both at disconnect in Q2 and reconnected Q3 is not gotten back to where it was several years ago. Some of that could tie into the low end of the market where you have some incremental fixed wireless access. I think importantly for us we're continuing well in fiber markets and as it relates to fixed wireless access where you have a lower quality, lower throughput, lower capacity product, that's really not even lower priced when you combine mobile and Internet together. But on the increment, it appears to be that way. We feel pretty good about that space, just given the amount of bandwidth usage that increases over time and the natural capacity constraints that we've all spoken about in the past. So, I think some combination of that, as well as Jessica mentioned, we had a relatively modest, but small impact on the Disney programming dispute, which drove an additional 15,000 units. But just if you step back, for all the reasons that we know, the broadband market has been temporarily stunted for growth. But we are growing in both our existing footprint as well as in the rural subsidized footprint as well and we're providing that so people can evaluate where both pieces are. In terms of video, five years from now, I think there'll still be a traditional video business that exists. And then I'll talk a little bit about where it could evolve to. But a traditional video business that exists, hopefully with additional value in it with DTCs, bundled in, in a way that increases the stickiness of the linear business, is just to the benefit of our ourselves and programmers, we can do that through these renovated agreements with the programmers and the combination of Xumo that creates utility for customers to find content in an easier way and have a deeper library and availability of that content. I do think, as you mentioned and as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have an opportunity to evolve to a state-of-the-art video marketplace where we can provide that type of traditional linear integrated DTC and SVOD product for customers who can afford it. It's a value. But when you get that, it's a very valuable product, and it's something that we'd be proud of. And for those customers who are going to be coming more in and out of the video market with different packages because of affordability, that's been driven by the programmers and because of the availability of DTC's a\u0300 la carte, that Xumo, for us, can provide a really good marketplace to sell those products, again, for the benefit of the programmers as well and gives customers options wherever they want to go. And to your point, not only do we have the traditional video business delivered by Spectrum, but we also have the ability to monetize, from an advertising revenue perspective, the platform through our equity investment in the 50-50 joint venture of Xumo. So nobody sitting here forecasting that traditional linear video is going to grow. But I do think it still remains very important to our connectivity relationships. I think we have a strategic advantage in the marketplace because of our capabilities as a broadband provider with a scaled video platform with the programming relationships that we have and the ability to package together a hybrid model that creates value for customers and is also a distribution engine for these DTC apps, either on a standalone or a bundled basis, for customers and programmers in the future. So if I step back from a video perspective, again, I'm not forecasting growth, but the past 15 years, there's been very little to be optimistic about, either from a customer perspective because of what the programmers have done or for ourselves as a distributor. And for the first time, I see a path where we can create value for customers and create utility and that ultimately will enhance the value of the connectivity services that we provide through our seamless connectivity in Spectrum One, which we're beginning to market now as part of Xumo. It was our fault, Ben. That's true. Why don't I take two of those, being network evolution -- or start off with two of those network evolution video CPE, and let Jessica take expansion and any gaps that I missed on the first two. On network evolution, we -- I mentioned that we could potentially slow down by, call it, six months. And then the counter to that, obviously, is wait a second, I thought this is improving your competitive standpoint, it is. But I would flag that we're competing. One, it's not that material at a time difference. And two, we're competing well against fiber today. And our goal remains to have a superior speed claims across everywhere we operate in our footprint. That being said, we've always said that we'll accelerate investments wherever we can. And the trade-off to that is we also recognize there is value in showing some discipline to shareholders in terms of the overall envelope capital and these rural investments, which continue to expand both in terms of size and our capabilities to deploy quickly. They produce immediate gains. So when you step back and think about trying to balance both our traditional approach, which is if there's capital returns, capital that can be deployed that has great ROI go as fast as you can, at the same time, balance investor expectations and show discipline there in terms of the overall envelope, a six-month time line, it's not going to make that much difference long-term. There is an additional benefit operationally, which is that an extended time line allows some of our DAA or distributed access architecture suppliers to catch up with the latest technology at full scale so that we can deploy the most advanced gear as part of this wave of high split and DOCSIS -- eventually DOCSIS 4.0 implementation. So, that's my thoughts on network evolution. Jessica can come back in a second and clean up on that, if I missed something. On video CPE, it's -- we have, over time, spent less on video CPE because we've been able to recycle World Box at the initial beginning of deployment for Xumo, we needed to get a starting state inventory of Xumo Boxes, and that's captured in capital. On the increment, we will be deploying more new boxes than we have in the past because we're essentially using Xumo as our go-to-market deployment for video CPE, and that's going very well right now. And -- now the boxes are less expensive than what traditional boxes have been over the past, and we expect the cost of those boxes to continue to decline significantly. So, you'll have a combination of volume, which will be determined by our success, and a lower price point over time as well as lower need to build up inventory through all of our channels and throughout the country. So it's -- there's a step-up there. But long term, I don't expect it to be that material. So Ben, you got probably more than you asked for. But Jessica was talking and I step back -- if you step it up one level from that, I think it's important just to reiterate that this company has a very strong focus on long-term capital allocation, long-term shareholder value creation. But we also understand the value of shareholder confidence along the way. And so we're going to go outside of our comfort zone here before we finish our operating plan, try to provide some of that additional disclosure and transparency, and make sure that we've got the full buy-in of our shareholders along the way and demonstrate what we've always been, I think, is really good allocators of capital. For sales and marketing. Vijay, on BEAD, you talked about pipeline, the BEAD has always been very difficult to forecast exactly what it will be because there's state allocations now, but how much of that is near our footprint. We're working through all of that. It's going to take a long time for that. So, -- and -- but in the meantime, RDOF and the state grants, they're going well. And there's a very large pipeline, as we've talked about, absent BEAD. I think it's fair to say that we were somewhat disappointed in the potential guidelines that came out from NTIA. And all I'm trying to say, without getting too much in the detail, NTIA states are all aware of the issues that we have. But to be clear, the states that adopt the NTIA's proposed guidelines on things such as Internet tiers, dictating Internet tiers, dictating pricing, labor practices, those just won't be attractive state for us to bid in. And so what we will do is we'll focus our investments on the states that allow us to retain flexibility to run the business, properly respond to market demand and ultimately, earn a healthy return. So, that's our focus. And so it's very difficult to forecast what, if any, BEAD investments will occur at this stage. And it's going to take us some time, I think, to figure that out as well as everybody else for that matter. So, we're not unique. Phil, on the -- let me take the customer one. The -- our goal has been to increase net adds for Internet year-over-year. I think given some of what we've seen just in early October for the reasons that we talked about before, I think it would require a very successful November and December. So I think we're going to be hard-pressed to hit that. I think the underlying trends in the business we've talked about where that sets us up for 2024. And so we're really optimistic about that. But I think it requires a pretty -- a very healthy November and December in order to achieve what was our original goal. I'll do my best to answer as much of that as I can. The mobile retention, we're not having to do much of anything at all, simply because these lines are being actively used. They have similar port in rates to what we have elsewhere. They also have similar -- nearly similar device purchase rate. So they are real customers, they are looking very much like any other existing customer.  When they roll tier from a $0 price point for the first line, many of them are paying for a second line. But they go from a first line at $0 to $30, and that product is the fastest mobile product in the country, and it's providing it at the lowest rate relative to that speed. So, at $30, you can't replicate that mobile product anywhere else in the country that's producing that speed. And then all-in, when you think about it from a convergence standpoint, it's a product that has a structural advantage that's difficult for anyone else to replicate. So, we do have some small tactics around the edge that we can do to retain customers under different circumstances, but that's not being heavily used at this point, simply because it's sticking. On ACP, for the benefit of the broader audience, that's the affordable connectivity program. This program, federal program, it's brought Internet connectivity to customers who really wouldn't have access to broadband otherwise. And -- it's also allow existing customers who would have been coming in and out of the broadband marketplace really given the affordability issues, to remain connected consistently. So, I think we think it's been a really effective program. We're proud to be the largest ACP provider in the country. Just this week, I understand the White House has asked Congress to authorize more money for ACP earlier. And I hope that Congress will fund it before running out next year. Now, you asked the question, what happens to the extent it's not funded? Just as I mentioned, most of these customers receive -- that received ACP support today were Internet customers before the program was founded. We have low-income broadband programs that existed before ACP began and because of the value we provide in that connectivity, I do think that we'll continue to retain these customers. We have ways where they're moving them into the lower speed products that we have to be able to save the money more importantly, if you think about the mobile build the vast majority of these customers have inside their home, we can save them hundreds or even thousands of dollars every year, even though ACP disappeared simply by moving them over to our mobile. So, we have a lot of tools available to us for these customers to make sure that they stay. I hope is that we don't need to go down that path. I hope is that we can still save them that money by kind of getting them on to Spectrum Mobile and Spectrum One. But I'm hopeful that the program, which has been very successful, gets successfully renewed. Thank you all. Appreciate it."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 63,000 Internet customers in the third quarter. We estimate that approximately 15,000 third quarter Internet disconnects were driven by the temporary loss of ESPN in September. Video customers declined by 327,000 in the third quarter, with about 100,000 video disconnects driven by the Disney programming dispute. The overall impact to customer relationships was less than we expected, facilitated in part by the wide availability of over-the-top alternative. The loss of Disney programming occurred both at the beginning of football season and in the midst of a programming cost pass-through and the launch of our new Auto Pay discount incentive on Internet. Nonetheless, operationally, we handled the Disney dispute very well. But our billing and retention call centers were not fully back to normal until early October, so there was lingering customer net add impact early in the fourth quarter. Turning to mobile. We added 594,000 mobile lines in the third quarter. Wireline voice customers declined by 286,000 in the third quarter. Overall market activity, churn and gross adds, remained well below pre-COVID levels, partly driven by persistently low move rates. We continue to compete well in a portion of our footprint that is overlapped by fiber, but we also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the lower usage and price-sensitive customer segments of our residential and SMB businesses. That product remains slower and less reliable than what we can deliver, and will be additionally constrained as consumers demand more and more data. In fact, high data usage customers that switched to fixed wireless have a higher propensity to return to our Internet service. Despite our Disney dispute, third quarter residential Internet churn was at a new record low for the third quarter. Our Spectrum Mobile product also continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers has continued to increase. Boarding from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions grew year-over-year, despite much higher mobile sales. We also continue to see healthy data usage on our Spectrum One promotional lines and remain confident that these lines should perform well as long-term customers. In the third quarter of last year, we launched Spectrum One pilot programs in a handful of markets. The pilot program customers reached their 12-month anniversary during the third quarter of this year, and incremental churn on those lines was small and even less than we expected. Turning to rural. Subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the third quarter, with 78,000 passings activated. And we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. As our RDOF build has progressed, we have identified roughly 300,000 adjacent passings along the way that are not in the sense of slot groups we want, but we will add to our network as we complete the RDOF build. Because of these adjacent passings, we now expect that our RDOF initiative will yield a total of 1.3 million passings to be constructed over a multiyear period. And while labor and equipment costs have both increased, we expect the average net cost per passing of these 1.3 million passings to be similar to our original RDOF net cost per passing estimate. We don't expect any potential BEAD build, subject to what Chris mentioned, to begin until 2025. Moving to financial results, starting on slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet, partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.6% year-over-year, given a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base and $63 million of residential customer credits related to the Disney lockout, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue per customer relationship was flat year-over-year. As slide 6 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year. Excluding Disney-related credits, residential revenue grew by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue declined by 0.9% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were partly offset by SMB customer growth of 1.3% year-over-year. Enterprise revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.5%. Third quarter advertising revenue declined by 20.3% or $97 million year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 1.8%, due to a more challenged advertising market, partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 28.8% year-over-year, driven by higher mobile device sales. In total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year, and up 1.5% year-over-year when excluding advertising and the impact of the $68 million in total Disney-related customer credits. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 7. In the third quarter, total operating expenses were approximately flat year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 6% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages and a $61 million benefit related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in early September. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. We now expect that for the full year 2023, programming cost per video customer will decline by approximately 3% year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 15.2%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs, partly offset by lower regulatory and franchise fees and lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by previous adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Those were partly offset by productivity improvements, including from tenure investments, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. Sales and marketing costs declined by 1.4%, primarily driven by lower labor costs, as we've lapped our prior year employee investments in sales and marketing. Overall, while we certainly had some additional overtime in our call centers, given the Disney dispute, it was not a material expense driver this quarter. Finally, other expenses grew by 2.5%, driven by labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.7% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on slide 8. We generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, up from $1.2 billion last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower other operating expense, partly offset by higher interest expense. Turning to slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $3 billion in the third quarter, above last year's third quarter spend of $2.4 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on upgrade rebuild due to our network evolution initiative, higher spend on line extensions driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunities, and higher CPE, driven by the purchase of Xumo devices for our launch earlier this month. For the full year 2023, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $11.2 billion. Capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, should total approximately $7.2 billion, higher than our previous expectation. The increase reflects additional Xumo CPE purchases and an acceleration of network spend related to future high split markets, including inventory accumulation and other preparation activities like walk-out and design and proactive equipment swap-outs of both DTAs and MPEG2 boxes. As Chris noted, we continue to expect to spend approximately $100 per passing to evolve the network to offer multiple gigabit speeds. There has been no change to our longer-term network evolution CapEx outlook. We also continue to expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to total approximately $4 billion. We are working through our 2024 operating plan right now. Given the greater subsidized rural passings and construction opportunity we currently see, we may partially fund that opportunity by very modestly slowing our network evolution plan, as Chris mentioned. And as we complete our 2024 plans, we will provide a more detailed outlook on our fourth quarter 2023 call in January. I want to highlight that capital expenditures, excluding line extensions and network evolution as a percentage of total revenue, have remained consistent since 2021. And following the completion of our network evolution initiative, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 level, which has important long-term cash flow implications. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow this quarter versus $1.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx, mostly driven by our network evolution and expansion initiatives. A couple of brief comments on working capital and cash taxes before turning to the balance sheet. Excluding the impact of mobile devices, we now expect our full year 2023 change in working capital to be negative by a few hundred million dollars, given the timing of capital expenditures and lower-than-expected accrued programming at year-end. On cash taxes, we did have a lower cash tax payment in the third quarter, which is just a timing difference. The full year cash tax outlook, which I provided during our fourth quarter 2022 call, still stand. We finished the quarter with $97.6 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.45 times, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our four to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased two million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $854 million, at an average price of $421 per share. Our 2023 EBITDA growth has been pressured by significant investments we've made in the future growth of our business. As we move toward 2024, pressure on our EBITDA growth will begin to abate, with growing transaction efficiency as we benefit from building employee tenure and easier comps as we have now lapped the impact of those employee investments. Lower transactions in our mobile business, which drove down -- which drive down our per customer cost of service and building as we move into next year, revenue growth acceleration from the roll-off of our mobile free line offers and positive impact from political advertising. In addition, faster pacing of our rural build should bring additional positive impact to customer net additions next year. In the longer term, the competitive impact in operational efficiencies from our network evolution will drive a stronger broadband business. Convergence momentum will improve our churn and generate financial growth for both broadband and mobile, and transformational changes to the video business can enhance the value of our product for our connectivity customers. The investments we have been making and will continue to make are set to drive the growth of our business going forward. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A Sure. Thanks, Craig. So I'm going to start on the wireless side, and then I'll come back and hit the Internet side. On the wireless side, our rate of net additions, it's been not perfectly steady, but fairly steady over the last four quarters now, with Spectrum One in place. And so as you lap and have the roll-off of those free lines that were in the fourth quarter of last year, and you create new free lines in the fourth quarter of this year, what I would say is that the impact that the free lines have on overall ARPU, it ceases to become a pressure on ARPU. And as the free lines as a portion make up a smaller and smaller percentage of the total lines, over time, because the base is growing underneath them and the number of free lines sort of stabilizes, I think that you do have a little bit of remaining -- or you could have a little bit of positive pressure on ARPU. The other side of that, we do still have some legacy pricing in the mix that has to roll off. So probably on wireless, more stabilized next year. If you think about what the impact is that it's having on Internet, so Internet ARPU growth, if you sort of look at it at a product ARPU level, gap growth in the year-over-year was 2.6%. Without the Spectrum One mobile allocation in there, it would have been 3.7%. So you have about a 1.1% difference in product line ARPU growth that relates to that allocation from the fee line. As those free lines start to roll off, I think actually, the dynamic is the same. The total free lines in the system become sort of steady in the year-over-year. So that mobile allocation becomes steady as you get into Q4. So, there is the potential then that what you see from a GAAP reporting perspective is better ARPU growth on the sort of Internet component, but it's related to just not having the building of that GAAP allocation inside of the Internet product. Yes. So maybe I'll try to help you with some numbers around network evolution and rural. I'm going to caveat it that we're still working through our operating plan for next year. So, I'm not going to give a 2024 guide. But just to help you frame the issue. If you think about where our run rate for rural passings will be in Q4 to reach our 300,000, you have to have 110,000 passings in Q4, which we're actually pretty confident that we will meet. If you take that run rate and sort of push it into four quarters of next year, we would build the 440,000 passing, which is 140,000 more rural patents than what we built this year. We've told you before, and it's true that passings timing isn't perfectly aligned with spend. So it's not a perfect guide. But if you put that at the net cost per passing, the $3,800 that we've talked about for RDOF, it would put the run rate next year on the order of $500 million higher than where we are inside of this year, assuming that all of the other components of line extensions remain the same, which there is a little variability there. But I think it's a good way to think about the issue overall. I think you have to couple that on the other side, with an understanding that network evolution spend sort of like our rural construction, is front loaded. There's a lot of costly preparation and inventory building work that needs to be done before you make it into the field to actually do the high slip or to replace equipment. We expect that we're going to spend a little over $1 billion this year in 2023 on high split, which leaves a substantial a substantial amount of spend in the project and a large portion of which if we continue at our current pace would hit inside of next year. So adjusting the timing of high split won't be enough probably to fully offset the additional line extension spend, but it can help. And as Chris said, we are looking at it sort of in the context of a total package to say, what's an appropriate amount of capital expense load to put against the business given where we sit. No, you're right. I want to say one more thing about it, though. So as we think about all of this investment that we're making in rural, I think it's probably -- we need to drive additional visibility around sort of the value that's related to having sort of unique one-time capital investments like that. We're taking a look at a lot of different ways we could think about that. We consider it a JV, but the returns are so strong. I don't think we want to share them. We've considered a tracking stock. I think structurally, it's complicated, but it does sort of do what I'm thinking about and kind of trying to create focus on the spending on rural as really acquiring passing is more like M&A, instead of thinking about it the way that you would think about CapEx. Absent doing one of those things, I am looking at additional disclosures to create more transparency. And so I think you should look for us to be trying to bring some of those disclosures early next year. And the other way that you can think about it with what's already been built, which I think is easier to sort of wrap your mind around as to what value has been created. Jonathan at New Street actually laid out a nice way to think about sort of what's the value of overall passing once it's built. His number came in around $9,000. And I'm not going to argue with him because I think it's a good space to think about it. So we built 315,000 rural passings so far. At $9,000 per passing, it's around $2.8 billion. Our average net cost per passing on the subsidized rural build is around $3,800. So, you can assume something like $1.6 billion of capital has been spent against those completed passings. And what that means is that we've created value, the current value of the passings at $2.8 billion versus the $1.6 billion that we've spent. We've already created value of $1.8 billion or $1.2 billion related to the building of those passings. And as we continue to accelerate the pace of the build, the pace at which we add that value to our business will increase. So we are looking at additional transparency there and trying to help as we sort of think about what our total capital spend might look like for next year, also making sure that we pair it with good disclosure and help from a valuation perspective so that you can see the value that those are adding to the business as we get them built. Yes. So Vijay, first on the cost items, I don't have any change in my expectation relative to cost to serve in sales and marketing, exiting the year at close to zero. And I think we've talked in our remarks, and it is our expectation that as our -- as the tenure in those areas mature, and as we -- because now, as of the end of Q3, we've really lapped the one-time increase related to the investments that we made on the employee side. Well, as of the end of the quarter, I think you also lapped in cost to serve for the most part. And so the rate of increase -- why I'd say that? So, we should expect to be more efficient across those areas going forward, whether that's sort of every quarter mix. I'm not going to be specific about where we'll be inside of next year and the quarters. But I do think our overall expectation is that from this point, we drive efficiency in those spaces. And as we have said all along in rural, we've been extremely disciplined from a financial perspective and looking at the specific passing that we're bidding on to make sure that we're comfortable that it will generate financial returns and all things factor into that, including the limitations that you have under the regulatory environment. On the EBITDA side, so thinking about what the components are, as you go into Q4 and next year, in Q4, you do still have an advertising headwind and actually the most significant advertising headwind of the year because of political advertising. But as you go into next year, then that turns around where you're back in a political year and you have the benefit of political advertising. As I said earlier, we've sort of lapped the last of our 2022 labor adjustments as at the end of Q3. So I think the trajectory from a cost perspective on cost to serve and sales and marketing is -- it gives -- you have easier comps and you have growing efficiencies sort of going into next year. In the fourth quarter, we'll start gaining revenue from the mobile free line roll-off. It's relatively small inside of Q4, but the impact builds as you go through next year. So we expect to have a good tailwind from that. And then we continue to expect to have just overall efficiency from our 10-year investments across the business. So, as we said, I think that we recognized that EBITDA was challenged in 2023, by both the investments that we're making, doing it in a nonpolitical year. But as we get into Q4 and going into next year, our expectation is that we've pushed through most of that headwind and that we'll be in a better position. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning, and welcome to Charter's second quarter 2023 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call; however, we encourage you to read them carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectation, predictions, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only, and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that, all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today\u2019s call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we added 77,000 Internet customers, and we continue to benefit from our Spectrum One offering and our network expansion initiatives. We also added 648,000 spectrum mobile lines. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 6.6 million total mobile lines. Over 11% of our Internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years. Spectrum Mobile is the nation's fastest mobile service. We see mobile lines as an extension of our WiFi and seamless connectivity service, and we expect our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to further Internet growth. We're pleased with the progress of our growth initiatives and our performance in the second quarter, and we maintained EBITDA despite the significant employee investments we made through 2022, which will start generating growth benefits later this year. We remain focused on our three key strategic initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution, each of which is designed to help us grow our business and each of which remains very much on plan. Our network evolution plan is progressing well and offers us significant benefits. First, it will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of our customers and competitors everywhere we operate, with symmetrical and multi-gig speeds via DOCSIS 4.0 and the ability to provide 25, 50 or even 100 gigabit per second speeds with fiber on demand. This evolution path also creates fallow upstream and downstream capacity for years, driving lower node spot capital. And by upgrading the actives and amplifiers and nodes and converting analog optics to digital, we lower our future operating and maintenance expenses all at a very low cost, much of which was funded from capital and operating cost savings over time. Unlike telco companies who prioritize more attractive footprints for their upgrades, our deployment is across our entire footprint. The cable industry is nearly ubiquitous deployment of a tremendous amount of spectrum to each home will provide the scaled platform for software and product developers to create new bandwidth-intensive, low latency, high compute services. This uniform deployment of network capabilities is what cable has always done to lead the development of new technologies into our networks at scale. And that unique approach is what has and will maintain our competitiveness into the future. So our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter. So far, the execution of this large physical upgrade has gone well, and capital costs are coming in on target. Excluding the benefit of any network savings, we continue to expect to spend $100 per passing. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve. Spectrum One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and Spectrum Mobile network, each of which run on our advanced WiFi product. Today, over 45% of our Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, and over 75% of our mobile customers now attached to the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes, providing higher speeds with more reliability to customers with lower cost to Charter. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotion and retail. We're excited for the upcoming release of the Xumo product, which I believe will be an industry-leading platform for customers to access all of their linear and DTC video content with unified search and discovery. Together with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the US, Xumo will be our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're currently conducting field trials in the product, and we remain on track for deployment later this year. Our expansion initiative with subsidized rural construction is also on plan. Penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better pace than planned. Charter is the largest and fastest-growing rural provider in the nation. Our scale and reputation as a rural builder positions us well for winning additional state and local funds, and we hope significant BEAD infrastructure funding. Although the rules and recommendations from NTIA on BEAD funding differ from successful programs currently deployed by the states in which we operate, we'll work with key stakeholders and government officials to reach a place where the rules are still conducive to private investment. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and satisfaction, driving faster customer growth. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in training and tenure, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our customer service platforms will further reduce transactions. There's been a lot of discussion about what artificial intelligence and machine learning can do to improve products and business models. Charter already uses advanced analytics and machine learning in various stages and forms across sales, service and network operations. And we expect to continue our investments in AI, machine learning and digital service in ways that meet customers where and how they want to receive service and continually enhance tools for our sales and service employees to simplify their jobs. Ultimately, AI will improve both customer and employee satisfaction and enhance our operating efficiency by driving fewer physical service transactions, lower cost and lower churn for years to come. Our operating strategy is focused on running our business for long-term value creation for our shareholders, which includes two of the cable industry's most successful investors. Simply put, our operating strategy is founded on having great products, pricing and packaging that creates value for customers and is very difficult for competitors to replicate so that we get more products into each household and drive more penetration across the network, which lowers our cost to serve. And then combine that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers. We have a great team here at Charter, and we're committed to disciplined execution and investment in this operating strategy, which we believe is good for customers, employees and the communities we serve and will drive significant long-term value creation for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we added 77,000 Internet customers in the second quarter, versus 38,000 in the prior year period when excluding last year's Internet disconnects related to the transition from EBB to ACP. Video customers in the second quarter declined by $200,000 and wireline voice declined by 221,000, and we added 648,000 mobile lines. Internet churn remained near record lows for the second quarter and flat year-over-year. and Internet gross additions improved year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in Internet net additions was driven by tailwinds from our rural construction initiative, the continued success of our Spectrum One product, better sales yields from higher tenured employees and a slower pace of fiber overbuild in our footprint during the quarter. Despite the year-over-year improvement in net adds, overall market activity remains well below pre-COVID level, partly driven by very low move rates. We also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segment of residential and SMB. As Chris mentioned, our Spectrum Mobile product continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers continued to increase and was higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Important from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions are essentially the same today as they were prior to the launch of Spectrum One despite much higher mobile sales. And with good usage on those promotional lines and unbeatable quality and value at a $30 retail price point, we expect the lines to perform well as long-term customers. Turning to rural, subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the quarter with 68,000 passing activated and we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. Additionally, costs are coming in as planned and we have the labor, equipment and supply necessary to execute our bills. We continue to bid on additional subsidies. In addition to RDOF, we've now won over $700 million in state subsidies for over 300,000 passings with a gross build cost of approximately $1.7 billion and a per passing cost to Charter net of subsidies of approximately $3,200. As Chris mentioned, we also look forward to the bidding process, assuming the right regulatory conditions. Moving to financial results, starting on slide 7. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet, partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.3% year-over-year given a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower priced video packages within our base, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. As Slide 7 shows, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 0.2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 1.7%, partly offset by lower monthly SMB revenue per customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 6.2% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.2%. Second quarter advertising revenue declined by 16.5% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core advertising revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew 28.5% year-over-year driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.5% year-over-year and up 1.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising. Moving to operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $48 million or 0.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 7.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.1% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates in the second half of '22 - by higher programming rates. In the second half of 2023, we now expect year-over-year growth in programming cost per video customer to be similar to the growth we saw in the first half of 2023. other cost of revenue increased by 15.4%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales, other mobile direct costs and higher RSN costs driven by more Lakers games partly offset by lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 3.6% year-over-year, driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile, which is partly offset by productivity improvements, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. As we mentioned last quarter, our employee attrition has declined more quickly than we expected given the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting. In response, we lowered our normal hiring in the first half of this year, and our overall headcount is now normalizing with increasing overall tenure and quality. Longer term, we continue to expect to see additional efficiencies in cost to service customers as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance, and network evolution investments. Sales and marketing costs grew by 3.6%, primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile and other expenses declined by 0.4%, driven by favorability in insurance expense, mostly offset by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.2% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 9. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, down from $1.5 billion last year with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by additional interest expense. Turning to Slide 10. Capital expenditures totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter, above last year's second quarter spend of $2.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and compared to $693 million in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in line extension was driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunity. Second quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022. We spent more on upgrade rebuild primarily due to our network evolution initiative, and support capital was higher primarily due to investments in information technology system. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending, including BEAD. As Slide 11 shows, we generated $668 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was driven by higher CapEx and mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and higher cash taxes as we became a full federal cash taxpayer in 2023. We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. And as of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $400 million at an average price of $341 per share. While our goal is to grow the business in the long-term, our focus on execution is driving operating leverage in the business even now. When you take the noise from political ads - when you take out the noise from political advertising, EBITDA grew by 1.3% year-over-year in the quarter, which means that we were more efficient despite significant mobile growth and a onetime step-up in labor investments. And we believe our financials will improve as we move later into the year with additional revenue growth in Internet and mobile that will begin showing in Q4 and lower service cost per customer as we realize the 10-year benefits of our investment in employees and lap last year's labor step up. Longer-term, we also expect to see continuing benefits in operating expenses from further digitization, network improvements, and benefits of programs like proactive maintenance. We're well poised for the future. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. I guess two questions. Maybe first, I think you guys will start to lap Spectrum One later this year, and it will probably be one of the first indications for all of us externally to sort of see the promotional roll-off activity and sort of the impact on churn, if any. I don't know if you could just maybe talk about what we should be expecting or how you guys are approaching that or what your expectations are as you go through that sort of first wave of promotional roll off. And then, I know we don't typically talk about video on these calls, but you guys have a lot going on there. And I was just wondering if you could spend a minute talking about sort of your strategy with Xumo and also the new sort of RSNs changes you've made? And just anything we should be thinking about in terms of the implications of this strategy on your financials, whether there's set-top box revenues we should be thinking about or capital intensity coming down, et cetera. Obviously, these are kind of big changes to a part of the business that we don't tend to spend a lot of time on. So I wanted to get your thoughts there. Thank you very much.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. Hi Ben, there's actually a lot in there. So on Spectrum One, we started - we launched Spectrum One at the beginning of October last year. And so you'll have the beginning anniversary dates start occurring then. The usage on these is high. And if you think through the comments in Jessica's prepared remarks, these are really good customers. And when you put the Internet WiFi and mobile together, you can't get that product, you can't get that quality and you can't get that pricing anywhere else inside the marketplace. And even if you just take a look at it as mobile stand-alone, at $30, at retail pricing, that's unmatchable. And to have that with the fastest mobile product in the marketplace, I don't see any reason to think that we're going to have difficulty managing through those roll-offs. Now that doesn't mean that you'll have to evaluate and make sure that you're poised to handle and address customer questions, but I think it sticks. We'll also have quietly in the marketplace this time last year, beginning in late July and through August. We did do some testing. So we'll have the opportunity as we go through the course of this quarter to perfect any reactions that we have from customers in small scale along the way. And so I think we're well set up to do that always have. And so I think we're in a good position. Could we have a small amount of turn potentially, but I don't think it's going to be material given the quality and the value that we're providing in and I think we found something that sticks. I don't know that Spectrum One will be permanently our end-state convergence and seamless connectivity, branding and platform. It's working well today, but we're going to continue to try things in the marketplace because I think we have a technology and a structure and capability that none of our competitors can really replicate in the marketplace. And I think that product and seamless connectivity will stick, and I think the value is very tied to customers. On video strategy, there hasn't been a fundamental change in our video strategy. We're losing the least amount of video customers of any of our peers or competitors. The reason that we've been able to do that is for two reasons. One is that we have flexibility, and we've tried to use that wisely in a way that is valuable to consumers to create products, pricing and packaging that will stick. And secondly, I think we have a high-quality video product as you think about our capabilities. If you want live TV, if you want DVR video on demand, if you want expanded basic, which is the majority of what we sell, or you want smaller packages, if you want that inside the home, outside the home across multiple devices, Cloud DVR, no set-top box, Roku, Apple TV or on your iPad all of those things exist. And there's not many providers who can provide that breadth of content and that level of functionality across the marketplace. The product is good and is designed for the vast majority of people in the marketplace. The issue has been price. And the fact that programmers have required us to take and provide content that customers may not necessarily watch or value and at the same time, increase the pricing. And so as we've talked about in the past, you've priced out a large number of customers out of the marketplace through that strategy by the programmers. And at the same time, they've gone around and sold that same content at a lower price in a less secure environment. So they've devalued the same content, and that creates a structural problem for the business. We've always thought that if we had the ability to create packages and we had better security in the marketplace of the content that these programmers have that we could sell more video and that would be good, obviously, for customers. It\u2019d be good for the program is ultimately and it would be better for us. But that will take a fair amount of leadership in the programming space to be able to get to that environment. What we found in the RSNs, which was the part of the question that you asked is that prior to Diamond entering into a restructuring environment, we had already created the capacity to have significant flexibility with our packages. And we've achieved that across the RSN space for the vast majority of the country, and we're rolling out versions of our select expanded basic with and without RSNs. We'll be doing that shortly, which does exactly what I just described. And it enables us to have a lower cost video packages for those who are not interested in RSNs because we have that flexibility. And I think as a result, we'll sell more video. And then if you think about the deal that we just did or announced in ourselves, as an RSN ourselves with the Dodgers and Lakers we took our own medicine. We increased the flexibility to an affiliate dramatically. And at the same time, we announced that we would launch eventually a direct-to-consumer app, but not just in the marketplace, but it will be available to all affiliates, including DIRECTV and including to our own customers. We think that's a model, both having flexibility as well as access to the DTC for the affiliates that could have some legs going forward and create packages that are valuable to consumers and actually allow us to sell more video. Xumo suggested about that really is an extension of what we've been doing already. Two-thirds of our video sales today are without a set-top box, meaning they're going on to Roku, Apple TV, Samsung TV or other platforms. And the concept around Xumo was to, through a joint venture with Comcast, have an ownership in an independent entity, which is Xumo that provides better functionality and exist for customers today where they can integrate all of their DTC SVOD and linear services in a single place with unified search and discovery with a voice remote. And so that will be our platform of choice to deliver to our video subscriptions going forward. And ultimately, I expect us to provide that to some broadband customers over time as well. And that will be good for Xumo as an independent platform, but I also think it provides functionality to our connectivity customers and we can provide the level of video services to our customers through our connectivity packages. So the financial implications of that and this will be an attractively priced box for customers as well as for us. I don't expect any material change to our capital expenditure outlook as a result of that. We've already been on a path where the equipment revenue that we've historically had through from set-top boxes has been on decline. So this kind of continues that path. So I think the financial implications are not that material.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. And that being said, I mean, the margin from the video product has been sort of - has shrunk over time. And our position has been that we're not willing to lose money in video. And so we believe the product is valuable for our customers. We're continuing to seek out ways that we can continue to provide those products in the way that people want, but to do it while still generating some financial return and whether that's in the form of set-top box revenue or in the way that we package the product overall, ultimately, we're continuing to try to sort of defend having margin in that business.\nChris Winfrey: Look, the video platform adds value to our connectivity services on a stand-alone basis. We're at or near the point of indifference. But we're committed to trying to find a path forward for video because we think it's a good product. We think it adds values to customers. And if we can have the flexibility to package and price it the right way, we think it's good for customers and it's good for us. And ultimately, it's much better for programmers over time as opposed to having the cord cutting continue to accelerate at the pace it's going.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks. Operator, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks guys. A couple. Nice margin in the quarter. Jessica, you mentioned headcount. Can you remind us of the expected trend in costs in the second half of the year and into 2024? How will those be impacted by rural initiatives and that headcount sort of normalizing? And then can you talk about the cadence of CapEx for the balance of the year and into 2024, so all-encompassing that line extensions and regular way business? Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So first, on the expense side, I gave some outlook in the first quarter investor call during the Q&A regarding cost to service expense and sales and marketing expense growth and that really - that outlook hasn't changed. I think we'll have a difficult comp in other expense in Q3 because there were lower corporate costs in the third quarter. But aside from that, I think what we have said already continues to be true about the trajectory on the expense side. In terms of capital expenditures and timing across the year, our rural construction initiative now, I would say, is spending at a more consistent pace than has been the history of the business. And so I think you saw it was somewhat more CapEx loaded into the front half of the year this year relative to our outlook for the entire year than what you would often see in a year. I would expect because that rural build sort of has to continue at a pace over time that you will see that greater level of consistency in CapEx across the quarters, with maybe less back-end loading into Q4 than what you've seen in other than what you've seen us do in the past. And I would expect that as well as we continue sort of into next year. The pace of the build on the network evolution and the overall activity, we'll just keep a base level of CapEx in the business that might have been - that might have had more of a seasonal trend previously.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks, Jessica\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Phil. Shall we. We\u2019ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from John Hodulik, UBS.\nJohn Hodulik: Thanks. Two questions for you. First, could you comment on the recent price increase? I think it's $5 increase on high-speed data. First, is that across the whole base? Maybe if you could compare it to sort of previous price increases? And do you think it's sort of enough to get the revenue per customer back into the black. So that's sort of number one. And number two, you guys over-indexed to the ACP program. Is there any way you could size that for us in terms of how large it is within the base talk about the strategy a little bit. And as we sort of go through that process, does that over time, potentially become a headwind for you guys in terms of broadband growth? Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: So the price adjustment in August is a $5 retail Internet increase for flagship and above customers, but it's coupled with a new auto pay discount of $5, so customers who are currently on Auto Pay or who opt into Auto Pay won't see a change in their overall price for Internet. There's a lot going on in ARPU. If we move into Q3, we'll fully lap the April 2022 rate adjustment, which included pass-through of video programming expenses. You'll have that August price adjustment and similar to recent trends, I mean when you talk about there being the reduction in ARPU on a per customer basis. It's really the headwind from the lighter mix of non-video customers and lower-priced video tiers that's driving that. And that obviously, I think, continues going forward. If you move into Q4, you'll start to see the Spectrum on promotional roll off. And have sort of the continuance of the other factors that I talked about. But that will be partially offset by lapping the November 2022 Internet-only rate adjustment. So I think that we've had fairly consistent growth in ARPU. If you look at the Internet ARPU growth. And I think, ultimately, our strategy is never to sort of grow the business just based on price. We aim to have competitive prices and to have good penetration because of that on our footprint. But that doesn't mean that we're sort of immune to the inflation impact and that where it's appropriate, we don't take adjustments in the market, which I think is what we've tried to do, but try to do it in a way that's prudent and consistent with our overall strategy.\nChris Winfrey: John, I think Jessica said it, but the $5 would not apply to anybody who's already on promotion, it only be a retail and it would to the extent that somebody is or it comes on auto pay, that won't pass through. So it's not that material in the end. On ACP, the - on ACP our strategy is to respond to the governmental request from the White House FCC and Congress of using this program. And we've been - I think, the most successful at doing that of providing a way for new customers to get into broadband or in the local income space as well as for existing customers to be able to stay in the broadband space through times of affordability issues, meaning the coming in and out of the market through nonpay churn. And we've been very successful doing that at the request of the government, and it's worked very well for those customers. I do think that there's some questions around it being renewed. It has bipartisan support. And so we're hopeful that it will be renewed. I think it's been a very good and successful program. And so it's brought in some new customers, particularly early on through EBB and ACP, and we've been able to also have existing customers benefit from staying in broadband through that program. To the extent that it went away, many of these customers were existing broadband customers and both for new and existing customers plus you. The - for new and existing customers. We have programs. We've always had programs like Spectrum Internet Assist and low-income programs that we can accommodate in dealing with that at the back end. I'm hopeful that's not the case and that it gets renewed because I do think it's a successful program.\nJohn Hodulik: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, John. We'll take our next question, shall we please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great, thanks, guys. I wonder if you can just stick with the ARPU theme for a second. It looks like ARPU in 2Q was a little bit lower than we expected maybe you didn't get the - as much of a benefit from the November price increase as we thought you would - or again, as Jessica said, there's a lot going on in ARPU. Maybe it's a function of how the bundled discount for Spectrum One is allocated across the different products. If you can give us some sort of some insight into drivers of ARPU in 2Q, that would be really helpful. And then Jessica, I think you mentioned during the call during your prepared remarks, the benefit that you're seeing in broadband from Spectrum. But I just missed the comment. If you can give us some more context on the pull-through effect you're seeing and how you think that progresses the longer that Spectrum One is in the market, that would be really helpful as well. Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Jonathan, on the ARPU point, we did continue, I guess, in the year-over-year, you have the offsetting impact of having lapped last year's rate adjustments and with what you talked about, which is that you had the price adjustments that we made earlier in the year, offset by some gap allocation of the discount related to the Spectrum One offer. I think you have all the components, right? And that is the sum of what's happening in ARPU in this quarter. That it does\nChris Winfrey: I think there's also a fallacy in trying to oversimplify it, too. There's a tremendous amount of activity that's taken place in the course of the year and the course of the quarter with acquisition, retention, bundle allocations, rate increases in the past, rate increases in the more current period, there's a very complicated model that goes there. In the end, it was 2.5%, I think, ARPU growth in Internet year-over-year despite some of the allocation differences. And given the fact that we're growing and taking share in both - in all parts of our footprint, I think the - we're really pleased with that mix and that outcome. And if we can accelerate particularly the growth, as we get through later part of this year, I think we'd be very happy with that. On - tied to that, your second question, Jonathan, was Spectrum One and pull-through - the point that was being made is that a higher portion of our Mobile is coming from new customer connects through Spectrum One, and that is very promising. Still the majority of our Mobile and extra coming through existing customers, but the portion of which is coming through new connects is increasing, which means that it's having an effect in the marketplace. The real key for us is to be able to educate customers about what seems connectivity is, what gigabit wireless can provide. It's in essence a new category, and that takes time to resonate, which is why I said, in Spectrum One is our first iteration of convergence and seamless connectivity, and it's going well. And I think that bodes well for Internet. And I think it bodes well for Mobile, and it bodes well for Convergence for us overtime.\nJonathan Chaplin: And Chris, do you expect that percentage to continue to increase? Is this sort of building momentum in terms of the benefit it has for broadband subs, do you think?\nChris Winfrey: Yes. But I also expect the Mobile attach rate to our existing Internet customers to increase too, because it's resonating not just for new customers, but for existing customers. And so you have benefits all around.\nJonathan Chaplin: Great. Thanks, guys.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrett Feldman: Yes, two questions. Thanks. One of the topics that have been discussed a lot so far this earnings season is that seasonality in the broadband business appears to be much more muted than we've seen previously. I'm curious for your take on it and how you're thinking about the significance of seasonal dynamics as you look into the remainder of the year. And then, just you noted that cash taxes were up a lot year-on-year, as you've transitioned to being a full cash taxpayer. I was hoping you could maybe give us some insight as to how to think about the way cash taxes are likely to trend over the course of any given year. I think historically, 2Q tends to be a high watermark, but I'm not sure, if there are nuances in terms of what we should be expecting for Charter? Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: On the seasonality side, market activity, including move activity continues to be quite low. And because of that, it's really difficult to predict what we might see in terms of seasonality going forward. We really think that the drivers inside of this Q2 or some of other factors, which include tailwinds from our overall construction initiative, the continued success of Spectrum One, the performance of the sales force, particularly higher sales yields and the slower pace of fiber overbuild that we saw. And so I would think more about those and sort of less about the seasonal patterns as you try to interpret what happened with our Q2 results. Your second question was.\nBrett Feldman: Cash taxes.\nJessica Fischer: Cash taxes. Thank you. On cash taxes, there are two payments inside of Q2. And so Q2 is the natural high watermark for the cash tax payments, and I think you should anticipate that our total cash taxes are consistent with the guidance that we've previously given, and that those payments are - those remaining payments are spread between Q3 and Q4. There's - you don't have that same phenomenon of the two cash tax payments in any other quarter.\nBrett Feldman: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Brett. Operator. We'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. I'm sure you guys have heard T-Mobile's discussion of your wireless net adds that they tend to be more non-port than would be the industry norm. And I wonder, if you could just talk about the kind of customers you're acquiring, whether they're coming from prepaid predominantly, whether a lot of them are new to wireless, meaning kind of younger kids, anything that you can do that could share some insight into where your subscribers are coming from? And then, obviously, always my favorite topic, anything that you can discuss particularly now that you're not reporting wireless profitability anymore. Anything you can discuss about margins and the trajectory towards profitability from that business?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. So look, I'd start by saying that any time you have your competitors that continue to talk about you on their earnings call, I take that as a compliment. The second thing I would say is clearly, some of their data, they're not really good at producing it, and that\u2019s not accurate. The third thing I would say is that in Jessica's prepared remarks, she mentioned the level of port activity is at/or better than it was even prior to the Spectrum One launch. So we're - we feel very good that these are not only good and high-quality customers, the majority of which are broadband customers today. So they've resembled the marketplace and the product is very attractive, it's selling in very well, and it's going to stick very well. And we look forward to seeing that develop over the next few quarters. On the mobile margin, you had done some work at your conference, I mentioned that if we thought your work was wrong, we would have let you know. And so that hasn't changed. And that was based off of some of the Verizon's disclosure as opposed to ours. Right now, we have a significant amount of customer acquisition, and so we have the cost of acquiring those customers and we have the cost of operating those customers. And we don't always have the full revenue attached to those customers just yet, and that will start to occur beginning in October and just grow from there. So the overall profitability of the mobile product, if it were a stand-alone product, which is not, is good. It's very good. And - but it's not - it's also at the same time, I want to be careful not to be dragged into it. It's never how we thought about that product. It's really an extension of our broadband product and seamless connectivity and a broadband product that none of our competitors can deploy ubiquitously across their footprint. And so you got to think about the broader profitability. But if it were a standalone product, the profitability is good, and our expectations have continued to move in that direction.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. The other thing I would point out in our December Investor Day, we showed the progress that we had made in the profitability, excluding customer acquisition costs. And I pointed out then that some of that progress was made because of - that that progress was not dependent on what you were paying in MVNO costs that on our side, we had work to do and that we were still doing and driving down the cost to serve our mobile customers. And that actually has been very successful through the first part of this year. And I think in terms of what we're thinking about in cost to serve per mobile customer that actually is coming down in a way that we expected it to. And I think as we continue to scale up the mobile business, have longer-tenured customers there as well as to improve our service activity that we'll continue to gain efficiency on the expense side for our internal expenses and drive additional profitability to the business that way as well.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Greg.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Greg. Operator, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks. I just want to talk about seasonality, obviously, Chris sort of suggesting we didn't see the same sort of seasonal impact in 2Q in terms of college and/or snowbirds and so forth. So can you help us think about - is that really changed? And does that mean that 3Q and 4Q that we see sort of reversals may not be as pronounced? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Let me - Jessica I answered this before, and so let me just add, I guess, some additional color to it. The - of course, we still had college disconnects, and we had snowbirds effect as well coming out of Florida. It's just the level of activity is a bit more muted compared to what it was pre-COVID. And what we've seen over the past couple of years is the visibility for us and it appears for everybody, has been a lot less around seasonals in Q2 and Q3 than it was pre-pandemic. So I think we want to be careful about how far we get ahead of our skis and letting people look out to Q3 and say that they'll be the pre-pandemic. I think the point that Jessica was trying to make is seasonality aside, the underlying trends are very good through Spectrum One through the rural construction build our competitiveness. And I'll come back to the fiber overbuild that's at a slower pace. But even in the areas that have fiber, which is in some sense, a larger amount of fiber than it had been in the past, we're performing better in those markets than we did even just a year ago. And so we feel good about seasonality aside the underlying trends. And I guess since we're on point, its everybody wants to hear if we haven't said it already, our goal is still to have higher net adds this year than it was last year. And so instead of focusing on quarters, we'd like to focus on just the overall trajectory and the long-term trend and it's good.\nVijay Jayant: Thanks Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Vijay. Shelby, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Kraft: Hi, good morning. I had two questions, if I could. First, and I apologize if you said this and I missed it, but I was wondering if you could talk about the contribution to broadband net adds from the rural line extensions and RDOFs? And then secondly, would you mind just giving us an update on your CBRS efforts? And also as part of that, I wanted to ask a hypothetical question. If portfolio of the fallow spectrum from low band through mid and high bands were available either through auction or acquisition. Is that something at this point that Charter would consider either alone or with a partner? Or is the current course still the much preferred strategy? thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Hi Bryan, it was in the materials subsidized rural construction is 26,000 Internet net adds inside the quarter. On CBRS, we are at a full commercial launch inside of a market today, and it is going well and on that basis and making sure that the handover times which are working very well right now, continue to perform like that at scale. Then we'll set the next year are the basis for our broader CBRS rollout. It's - I don't want to spook people either that we're going to be very focused on deploying that CBRS where there's a high and fast ROI. We have a number of other accretive projects that are going on right now through network evolution and expansion. And so we're very cognizant of the overall CapEx build. But we're going to build that in a measured way across our footprint, fully deployed the CBRS and the markets that we've acquired over time. But we're going to do it in a way that's very targeted and it generates fast returns. Your third question was around portfolio spectrum. I can't imagine why you're asking that. But forecasting. But we have a very strategic, good perpetual MVNO relationship with Verizon. And the economics as everybody knows, are very good. And that means - and combine that with what we were just talking about before. The ability through better and better WiFi and through CBRS over time to have the vast majority of the traffic continue and increasingly be over our network with faster speeds, means that we have the ability to lease the macro cell towers at an attractive rate and not be in the business directly of having to continue to build those towers, densify those towers and acquire additional spectrum. And I think it's a capital-light model that really works well for us. And I think it's a model that, as you can see, has worked very well for Verizon, our partner as well. So I think it's symbiotic. And I would never say never. We'll always take a look at things as they come up, but we haven't felt the need to be in the macro cell tower construction densification and Spectrum acquisition business at scale.\nBryan Kraft: Great, thank you, Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Brian. We'll take our last question from Michael Rollins. Go ahead, operator, sorry.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and Good morning. I was just curious to follow up on just the mobile discussion with a couple of questions on some of the segments. So in - one of the comments is that 11% of internet customers are taking mobile, which would infer almost two lines per account. Just curious if you're starting to see more of a shift to multiline and family plan adoption of your mobile services and if there's a significant opportunity to take up the number of lines per account over time. And then on the SMB side, are there some opportunities to accelerate the mobile gains there where they've been running at about 15,000 to 20,000 per quarter. Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So Michael, you're right. The opportunity for us to continue to increase the lines per customer is high. As you know, certain customers have multiple lines inside the household that are on different EIP plans and time lines. And so our success has been using the high value and high speeds that we have in the mobile product to acquire as many lines upfront in the household. And then over time, the opportunities to upgrade those other lines that are on different cascading EIP time lines. So that's working well and the opportunity is to continue to grow, not just penetration of mobile broadband customers, but to add new seamless connectivity customers through spectrum on but also to increase the number of lines per household, which, as you know, increases the stickiness of the product over time. It increases the over value that we provide because of the significant savings. The second question you asked is on SMB, and I think we're doing a good job there, but I think we can continue to do even better over time. And I think it's still early days in the SMB space, but we can add value there the same way that we do in residential and attack the space.\nMichael Rolls: Thanks.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Michael. That concludes our call. Operator, back to you.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we added 77,000 Internet customers, and we continue to benefit from our Spectrum One offering and our network expansion initiatives. We also added 648,000 spectrum mobile lines. At the end of the second quarter, we had over 6.6 million total mobile lines. Over 11% of our Internet customers now have mobile service, and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years. Spectrum Mobile is the nation's fastest mobile service. We see mobile lines as an extension of our WiFi and seamless connectivity service, and we expect our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to further Internet growth. We're pleased with the progress of our growth initiatives and our performance in the second quarter, and we maintained EBITDA despite the significant employee investments we made through 2022, which will start generating growth benefits later this year. We remain focused on our three key strategic initiatives: evolution, expansion and execution, each of which is designed to help us grow our business and each of which remains very much on plan. Our network evolution plan is progressing well and offers us significant benefits. First, it will allow us to maintain our fastest Internet and WiFi service claims in front of our customers and competitors everywhere we operate, with symmetrical and multi-gig speeds via DOCSIS 4.0 and the ability to provide 25, 50 or even 100 gigabit per second speeds with fiber on demand. This evolution path also creates fallow upstream and downstream capacity for years, driving lower node spot capital. And by upgrading the actives and amplifiers and nodes and converting analog optics to digital, we lower our future operating and maintenance expenses all at a very low cost, much of which was funded from capital and operating cost savings over time. Unlike telco companies who prioritize more attractive footprints for their upgrades, our deployment is across our entire footprint. The cable industry is nearly ubiquitous deployment of a tremendous amount of spectrum to each home will provide the scaled platform for software and product developers to create new bandwidth-intensive, low latency, high compute services. This uniform deployment of network capabilities is what cable has always done to lead the development of new technologies into our networks at scale. And that unique approach is what has and will maintain our competitiveness into the future. So our network evolution is good for the communities we serve, and it's good for Charter. So far, the execution of this large physical upgrade has gone well, and capital costs are coming in on target. Excluding the benefit of any network savings, we continue to expect to spend $100 per passing. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve. Spectrum One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and Spectrum Mobile network, each of which run on our advanced WiFi product. Today, over 45% of our Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, and over 75% of our mobile customers now attached to the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes, providing higher speeds with more reliability to customers with lower cost to Charter. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers with market-leading pricing at both promotion and retail. We're excited for the upcoming release of the Xumo product, which I believe will be an industry-leading platform for customers to access all of their linear and DTC video content with unified search and discovery. Together with our Spectrum TV app, the most viewed linear MVPD streaming service in the US, Xumo will be our go-to-market platform for new video sales. We're currently conducting field trials in the product, and we remain on track for deployment later this year. Our expansion initiative with subsidized rural construction is also on plan. Penetration gains in subsidized rural passings continues to grow at a better pace than planned. Charter is the largest and fastest-growing rural provider in the nation. Our scale and reputation as a rural builder positions us well for winning additional state and local funds, and we hope significant BEAD infrastructure funding. Although the rules and recommendations from NTIA on BEAD funding differ from successful programs currently deployed by the states in which we operate, we'll work with key stakeholders and government officials to reach a place where the rules are still conducive to private investment. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and satisfaction, driving faster customer growth. We continue to see the benefits of our investments in training and tenure, including better employee retention, higher quality service transactions and better sales yields. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our customer service platforms will further reduce transactions. There's been a lot of discussion about what artificial intelligence and machine learning can do to improve products and business models. Charter already uses advanced analytics and machine learning in various stages and forms across sales, service and network operations. And we expect to continue our investments in AI, machine learning and digital service in ways that meet customers where and how they want to receive service and continually enhance tools for our sales and service employees to simplify their jobs. Ultimately, AI will improve both customer and employee satisfaction and enhance our operating efficiency by driving fewer physical service transactions, lower cost and lower churn for years to come. Our operating strategy is focused on running our business for long-term value creation for our shareholders, which includes two of the cable industry's most successful investors. Simply put, our operating strategy is founded on having great products, pricing and packaging that creates value for customers and is very difficult for competitors to replicate so that we get more products into each household and drive more penetration across the network, which lowers our cost to serve. And then combine that with investments in high-quality service, which also increases our competitiveness to acquire more customers. We have a great team here at Charter, and we're committed to disciplined execution and investment in this operating strategy, which we believe is good for customers, employees and the communities we serve and will drive significant long-term value creation for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Sure. Hi Ben, there's actually a lot in there. So on Spectrum One, we started - we launched Spectrum One at the beginning of October last year. And so you'll have the beginning anniversary dates start occurring then. The usage on these is high. And if you think through the comments in Jessica's prepared remarks, these are really good customers. And when you put the Internet WiFi and mobile together, you can't get that product, you can't get that quality and you can't get that pricing anywhere else inside the marketplace. And even if you just take a look at it as mobile stand-alone, at $30, at retail pricing, that's unmatchable. And to have that with the fastest mobile product in the marketplace, I don't see any reason to think that we're going to have difficulty managing through those roll-offs. Now that doesn't mean that you'll have to evaluate and make sure that you're poised to handle and address customer questions, but I think it sticks. We'll also have quietly in the marketplace this time last year, beginning in late July and through August. We did do some testing. So we'll have the opportunity as we go through the course of this quarter to perfect any reactions that we have from customers in small scale along the way. And so I think we're well set up to do that always have. And so I think we're in a good position. Could we have a small amount of turn potentially, but I don't think it's going to be material given the quality and the value that we're providing in and I think we found something that sticks. I don't know that Spectrum One will be permanently our end-state convergence and seamless connectivity, branding and platform. It's working well today, but we're going to continue to try things in the marketplace because I think we have a technology and a structure and capability that none of our competitors can really replicate in the marketplace. And I think that product and seamless connectivity will stick, and I think the value is very tied to customers. On video strategy, there hasn't been a fundamental change in our video strategy. We're losing the least amount of video customers of any of our peers or competitors. The reason that we've been able to do that is for two reasons. One is that we have flexibility, and we've tried to use that wisely in a way that is valuable to consumers to create products, pricing and packaging that will stick. And secondly, I think we have a high-quality video product as you think about our capabilities. If you want live TV, if you want DVR video on demand, if you want expanded basic, which is the majority of what we sell, or you want smaller packages, if you want that inside the home, outside the home across multiple devices, Cloud DVR, no set-top box, Roku, Apple TV or on your iPad all of those things exist. And there's not many providers who can provide that breadth of content and that level of functionality across the marketplace. The product is good and is designed for the vast majority of people in the marketplace. The issue has been price. And the fact that programmers have required us to take and provide content that customers may not necessarily watch or value and at the same time, increase the pricing. And so as we've talked about in the past, you've priced out a large number of customers out of the marketplace through that strategy by the programmers. And at the same time, they've gone around and sold that same content at a lower price in a less secure environment. So they've devalued the same content, and that creates a structural problem for the business. We've always thought that if we had the ability to create packages and we had better security in the marketplace of the content that these programmers have that we could sell more video and that would be good, obviously, for customers. It'd be good for the program is ultimately and it would be better for us. But that will take a fair amount of leadership in the programming space to be able to get to that environment. What we found in the RSNs, which was the part of the question that you asked is that prior to Diamond entering into a restructuring environment, we had already created the capacity to have significant flexibility with our packages. And we've achieved that across the RSN space for the vast majority of the country, and we're rolling out versions of our select expanded basic with and without RSNs. We'll be doing that shortly, which does exactly what I just described. And it enables us to have a lower cost video packages for those who are not interested in RSNs because we have that flexibility. And I think as a result, we'll sell more video. And then if you think about the deal that we just did or announced in ourselves, as an RSN ourselves with the Dodgers and Lakers we took our own medicine. We increased the flexibility to an affiliate dramatically. And at the same time, we announced that we would launch eventually a direct-to-consumer app, but not just in the marketplace, but it will be available to all affiliates, including DIRECTV and including to our own customers. We think that's a model, both having flexibility as well as access to the DTC for the affiliates that could have some legs going forward and create packages that are valuable to consumers and actually allow us to sell more video. Xumo suggested about that really is an extension of what we've been doing already. Two-thirds of our video sales today are without a set-top box, meaning they're going on to Roku, Apple TV, Samsung TV or other platforms. And the concept around Xumo was to, through a joint venture with Comcast, have an ownership in an independent entity, which is Xumo that provides better functionality and exist for customers today where they can integrate all of their DTC SVOD and linear services in a single place with unified search and discovery with a voice remote. And so that will be our platform of choice to deliver to our video subscriptions going forward. And ultimately, I expect us to provide that to some broadband customers over time as well. And that will be good for Xumo as an independent platform, but I also think it provides functionality to our connectivity customers and we can provide the level of video services to our customers through our connectivity packages. So the financial implications of that and this will be an attractively priced box for customers as well as for us. I don't expect any material change to our capital expenditure outlook as a result of that. We've already been on a path where the equipment revenue that we've historically had through from set-top boxes has been on decline. So this kind of continues that path. So I think the financial implications are not that material. Look, the video platform adds value to our connectivity services on a stand-alone basis. We're at or near the point of indifference. But we're committed to trying to find a path forward for video because we think it's a good product. We think it adds values to customers. And if we can have the flexibility to package and price it the right way, we think it's good for customers and it's good for us. And ultimately, it's much better for programmers over time as opposed to having the cord cutting continue to accelerate at the pace it's going. John, I think Jessica said it, but the $5 would not apply to anybody who's already on promotion, it only be a retail and it would to the extent that somebody is or it comes on auto pay, that won't pass through. So it's not that material in the end. On ACP, the - on ACP our strategy is to respond to the governmental request from the White House FCC and Congress of using this program. And we've been - I think, the most successful at doing that of providing a way for new customers to get into broadband or in the local income space as well as for existing customers to be able to stay in the broadband space through times of affordability issues, meaning the coming in and out of the market through nonpay churn. And we've been very successful doing that at the request of the government, and it's worked very well for those customers. I do think that there's some questions around it being renewed. It has bipartisan support. And so we're hopeful that it will be renewed. I think it's been a very good and successful program. And so it's brought in some new customers, particularly early on through EBB and ACP, and we've been able to also have existing customers benefit from staying in broadband through that program. To the extent that it went away, many of these customers were existing broadband customers and both for new and existing customers plus you. The - for new and existing customers. We have programs. We've always had programs like Spectrum Internet Assist and low-income programs that we can accommodate in dealing with that at the back end. I'm hopeful that's not the case and that it gets renewed because I do think it's a successful program. I think there's also a fallacy in trying to oversimplify it, too. There's a tremendous amount of activity that's taken place in the course of the year and the course of the quarter with acquisition, retention, bundle allocations, rate increases in the past, rate increases in the more current period, there's a very complicated model that goes there. In the end, it was 2.5%, I think, ARPU growth in Internet year-over-year despite some of the allocation differences. And given the fact that we're growing and taking share in both - in all parts of our footprint, I think the - we're really pleased with that mix and that outcome. And if we can accelerate particularly the growth, as we get through later part of this year, I think we'd be very happy with that. On - tied to that, your second question, Jonathan, was Spectrum One and pull-through - the point that was being made is that a higher portion of our Mobile is coming from new customer connects through Spectrum One, and that is very promising. Still the majority of our Mobile and extra coming through existing customers, but the portion of which is coming through new connects is increasing, which means that it's having an effect in the marketplace. The real key for us is to be able to educate customers about what seems connectivity is, what gigabit wireless can provide. It's in essence a new category, and that takes time to resonate, which is why I said, in Spectrum One is our first iteration of convergence and seamless connectivity, and it's going well. And I think that bodes well for Internet. And I think it bodes well for Mobile, and it bodes well for Convergence for us overtime. Yes. But I also expect the Mobile attach rate to our existing Internet customers to increase too, because it's resonating not just for new customers, but for existing customers. And so you have benefits all around. Sure. So look, I'd start by saying that any time you have your competitors that continue to talk about you on their earnings call, I take that as a compliment. The second thing I would say is clearly, some of their data, they're not really good at producing it, and that's not accurate. The third thing I would say is that in Jessica's prepared remarks, she mentioned the level of port activity is at/or better than it was even prior to the Spectrum One launch. So we're - we feel very good that these are not only good and high-quality customers, the majority of which are broadband customers today. So they've resembled the marketplace and the product is very attractive, it's selling in very well, and it's going to stick very well. And we look forward to seeing that develop over the next few quarters. On the mobile margin, you had done some work at your conference, I mentioned that if we thought your work was wrong, we would have let you know. And so that hasn't changed. And that was based off of some of the Verizon's disclosure as opposed to ours. Right now, we have a significant amount of customer acquisition, and so we have the cost of acquiring those customers and we have the cost of operating those customers. And we don't always have the full revenue attached to those customers just yet, and that will start to occur beginning in October and just grow from there. So the overall profitability of the mobile product, if it were a stand-alone product, which is not, is good. It's very good. And - but it's not - it's also at the same time, I want to be careful not to be dragged into it. It's never how we thought about that product. It's really an extension of our broadband product and seamless connectivity and a broadband product that none of our competitors can deploy ubiquitously across their footprint. And so you got to think about the broader profitability. But if it were a standalone product, the profitability is good, and our expectations have continued to move in that direction. Thanks, Greg. Let me - Jessica I answered this before, and so let me just add, I guess, some additional color to it. The - of course, we still had college disconnects, and we had snowbirds effect as well coming out of Florida. It's just the level of activity is a bit more muted compared to what it was pre-COVID. And what we've seen over the past couple of years is the visibility for us and it appears for everybody, has been a lot less around seasonals in Q2 and Q3 than it was pre-pandemic. So I think we want to be careful about how far we get ahead of our skis and letting people look out to Q3 and say that they'll be the pre-pandemic. I think the point that Jessica was trying to make is seasonality aside, the underlying trends are very good through Spectrum One through the rural construction build our competitiveness. And I'll come back to the fiber overbuild that's at a slower pace. But even in the areas that have fiber, which is in some sense, a larger amount of fiber than it had been in the past, we're performing better in those markets than we did even just a year ago. And so we feel good about seasonality aside the underlying trends. And I guess since we're on point, its everybody wants to hear if we haven't said it already, our goal is still to have higher net adds this year than it was last year. And so instead of focusing on quarters, we'd like to focus on just the overall trajectory and the long-term trend and it's good. Hi Bryan, it was in the materials subsidized rural construction is 26,000 Internet net adds inside the quarter. On CBRS, we are at a full commercial launch inside of a market today, and it is going well and on that basis and making sure that the handover times which are working very well right now, continue to perform like that at scale. Then we'll set the next year are the basis for our broader CBRS rollout. It's - I don't want to spook people either that we're going to be very focused on deploying that CBRS where there's a high and fast ROI. We have a number of other accretive projects that are going on right now through network evolution and expansion. And so we're very cognizant of the overall CapEx build. But we're going to build that in a measured way across our footprint, fully deployed the CBRS and the markets that we've acquired over time. But we're going to do it in a way that's very targeted and it generates fast returns. Your third question was around portfolio spectrum. I can't imagine why you're asking that. But forecasting. But we have a very strategic, good perpetual MVNO relationship with Verizon. And the economics as everybody knows, are very good. And that means - and combine that with what we were just talking about before. The ability through better and better WiFi and through CBRS over time to have the vast majority of the traffic continue and increasingly be over our network with faster speeds, means that we have the ability to lease the macro cell towers at an attractive rate and not be in the business directly of having to continue to build those towers, densify those towers and acquire additional spectrum. And I think it's a capital-light model that really works well for us. And I think it's a model that, as you can see, has worked very well for Verizon, our partner as well. So I think it's symbiotic. And I would never say never. We'll always take a look at things as they come up, but we haven't felt the need to be in the macro cell tower construction densification and Spectrum acquisition business at scale. So Michael, you're right. The opportunity for us to continue to increase the lines per customer is high. As you know, certain customers have multiple lines inside the household that are on different EIP plans and time lines. And so our success has been using the high value and high speeds that we have in the mobile product to acquire as many lines upfront in the household. And then over time, the opportunities to upgrade those other lines that are on different cascading EIP time lines. So that's working well and the opportunity is to continue to grow, not just penetration of mobile broadband customers, but to add new seamless connectivity customers through spectrum on but also to increase the number of lines per household, which, as you know, increases the stickiness of the product over time. It increases the over value that we provide because of the significant savings. The second question you asked is on SMB, and I think we're doing a good job there, but I think we can continue to do even better over time. And I think it's still early days in the SMB space, but we can add value there the same way that we do in residential and attack the space. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we added 77,000 Internet customers in the second quarter, versus 38,000 in the prior year period when excluding last year's Internet disconnects related to the transition from EBB to ACP. Video customers in the second quarter declined by $200,000 and wireline voice declined by 221,000, and we added 648,000 mobile lines. Internet churn remained near record lows for the second quarter and flat year-over-year. and Internet gross additions improved year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in Internet net additions was driven by tailwinds from our rural construction initiative, the continued success of our Spectrum One product, better sales yields from higher tenured employees and a slower pace of fiber overbuild in our footprint during the quarter. Despite the year-over-year improvement in net adds, overall market activity remains well below pre-COVID level, partly driven by very low move rates. We also continue to see some impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segment of residential and SMB. As Chris mentioned, our Spectrum Mobile product continued to perform well in the quarter. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from new customers continued to increase and was higher than what we saw in the first quarter. Important from other carriers as a portion of our gross additions are essentially the same today as they were prior to the launch of Spectrum One despite much higher mobile sales. And with good usage on those promotional lines and unbeatable quality and value at a $30 retail price point, we expect the lines to perform well as long-term customers. Turning to rural, subsidized rural passings growth accelerated in the quarter with 68,000 passing activated and we continue to expect approximately 300,000 new subsidized rural passings this year. Additionally, costs are coming in as planned and we have the labor, equipment and supply necessary to execute our bills. We continue to bid on additional subsidies. In addition to RDOF, we've now won over $700 million in state subsidies for over 300,000 passings with a gross build cost of approximately $1.7 billion and a per passing cost to Charter net of subsidies of approximately $3,200. As Chris mentioned, we also look forward to the bidding process, assuming the right regulatory conditions. Moving to financial results, starting on slide 7. Over the last year, residential customers grew by 0.2%, with new customer growth driven by Internet, partly offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined by 0.3% year-over-year given a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower priced video packages within our base, partly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. As Slide 7 shows, residential revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 0.2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 1.7%, partly offset by lower monthly SMB revenue per customer, primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.2% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 6.2% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.2%. Second quarter advertising revenue declined by 16.5% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core advertising revenue was down 3.5% year-over-year due to a more challenged advertising market partly offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew 28.5% year-over-year driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.5% year-over-year and up 1.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising. Moving to operating expense and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 8. In the second quarter, total operating expenses grew by $48 million or 0.6% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 7.8% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.1% year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates in the second half of '22 - by higher programming rates. In the second half of 2023, we now expect year-over-year growth in programming cost per video customer to be similar to the growth we saw in the first half of 2023. other cost of revenue increased by 15.4%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales, other mobile direct costs and higher RSN costs driven by more Lakers games partly offset by lower ad sales costs. Cost to service customers increased by 3.6% year-over-year, driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile, which is partly offset by productivity improvements, lower service transactions per customer and lower bad debt. As we mentioned last quarter, our employee attrition has declined more quickly than we expected given the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting. In response, we lowered our normal hiring in the first half of this year, and our overall headcount is now normalizing with increasing overall tenure and quality. Longer term, we continue to expect to see additional efficiencies in cost to service customers as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance, and network evolution investments. Sales and marketing costs grew by 3.6%, primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile and other expenses declined by 0.4%, driven by favorability in insurance expense, mostly offset by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 0.2% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 9. We generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, down from $1.5 billion last year with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by additional interest expense. Turning to Slide 10. Capital expenditures totaled $2.8 billion in the second quarter, above last year's second quarter spend of $2.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2023 and compared to $693 million in the second quarter of 2022. The increase in line extension was driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market selling opportunity. Second quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter of 2022. We spent more on upgrade rebuild primarily due to our network evolution initiative, and support capital was higher primarily due to investments in information technology system. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures, excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, capital expenditures, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending, including BEAD. As Slide 11 shows, we generated $668 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.7 billion in the second quarter of last year. The decline was driven by higher CapEx and mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and higher cash taxes as we became a full federal cash taxpayer in 2023. We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. And as of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47 times. We intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 times to 4.5 times target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.1 million Charter shares in Charter Holdings common units, totaling about $400 million at an average price of $341 per share. While our goal is to grow the business in the long-term, our focus on execution is driving operating leverage in the business even now. When you take the noise from political ads - when you take out the noise from political advertising, EBITDA grew by 1.3% year-over-year in the quarter, which means that we were more efficient despite significant mobile growth and a onetime step-up in labor investments. And we believe our financials will improve as we move later into the year with additional revenue growth in Internet and mobile that will begin showing in Q4 and lower service cost per customer as we realize the 10-year benefits of our investment in employees and lap last year's labor step up. Longer-term, we also expect to see continuing benefits in operating expenses from further digitization, network improvements, and benefits of programs like proactive maintenance. We're well poised for the future. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yes. And that being said, I mean, the margin from the video product has been sort of - has shrunk over time. And our position has been that we're not willing to lose money in video. And so we believe the product is valuable for our customers. We're continuing to seek out ways that we can continue to provide those products in the way that people want, but to do it while still generating some financial return and whether that's in the form of set-top box revenue or in the way that we package the product overall, ultimately, we're continuing to try to sort of defend having margin in that business. Yes. So first, on the expense side, I gave some outlook in the first quarter investor call during the Q&A regarding cost to service expense and sales and marketing expense growth and that really - that outlook hasn't changed. I think we'll have a difficult comp in other expense in Q3 because there were lower corporate costs in the third quarter. But aside from that, I think what we have said already continues to be true about the trajectory on the expense side. In terms of capital expenditures and timing across the year, our rural construction initiative now, I would say, is spending at a more consistent pace than has been the history of the business. And so I think you saw it was somewhat more CapEx loaded into the front half of the year this year relative to our outlook for the entire year than what you would often see in a year. I would expect because that rural build sort of has to continue at a pace over time that you will see that greater level of consistency in CapEx across the quarters, with maybe less back-end loading into Q4 than what you've seen in other than what you've seen us do in the past. And I would expect that as well as we continue sort of into next year. The pace of the build on the network evolution and the overall activity, we'll just keep a base level of CapEx in the business that might have been - that might have had more of a seasonal trend previously. So the price adjustment in August is a $5 retail Internet increase for flagship and above customers, but it's coupled with a new auto pay discount of $5, so customers who are currently on Auto Pay or who opt into Auto Pay won't see a change in their overall price for Internet. There's a lot going on in ARPU. If we move into Q3, we'll fully lap the April 2022 rate adjustment, which included pass-through of video programming expenses. You'll have that August price adjustment and similar to recent trends, I mean when you talk about there being the reduction in ARPU on a per customer basis. It's really the headwind from the lighter mix of non-video customers and lower-priced video tiers that's driving that. And that obviously, I think, continues going forward. If you move into Q4, you'll start to see the Spectrum on promotional roll off. And have sort of the continuance of the other factors that I talked about. But that will be partially offset by lapping the November 2022 Internet-only rate adjustment. So I think that we've had fairly consistent growth in ARPU. If you look at the Internet ARPU growth. And I think, ultimately, our strategy is never to sort of grow the business just based on price. We aim to have competitive prices and to have good penetration because of that on our footprint. But that doesn't mean that we're sort of immune to the inflation impact and that where it's appropriate, we don't take adjustments in the market, which I think is what we've tried to do, but try to do it in a way that's prudent and consistent with our overall strategy. Jonathan, on the ARPU point, we did continue, I guess, in the year-over-year, you have the offsetting impact of having lapped last year's rate adjustments and with what you talked about, which is that you had the price adjustments that we made earlier in the year, offset by some gap allocation of the discount related to the Spectrum One offer. I think you have all the components, right? And that is the sum of what's happening in ARPU in this quarter. That it does On the seasonality side, market activity, including move activity continues to be quite low. And because of that, it's really difficult to predict what we might see in terms of seasonality going forward. We really think that the drivers inside of this Q2 or some of other factors, which include tailwinds from our overall construction initiative, the continued success of Spectrum One, the performance of the sales force, particularly higher sales yields and the slower pace of fiber overbuild that we saw. And so I would think more about those and sort of less about the seasonal patterns as you try to interpret what happened with our Q2 results. Your second question was. Cash taxes. Thank you. On cash taxes, there are two payments inside of Q2. And so Q2 is the natural high watermark for the cash tax payments, and I think you should anticipate that our total cash taxes are consistent with the guidance that we've previously given, and that those payments are - those remaining payments are spread between Q3 and Q4. There's - you don't have that same phenomenon of the two cash tax payments in any other quarter. Yes. The other thing I would point out in our December Investor Day, we showed the progress that we had made in the profitability, excluding customer acquisition costs. And I pointed out then that some of that progress was made because of - that that progress was not dependent on what you were paying in MVNO costs that on our side, we had work to do and that we were still doing and driving down the cost to serve our mobile customers. And that actually has been very successful through the first part of this year. And I think in terms of what we're thinking about in cost to serve per mobile customer that actually is coming down in a way that we expected it to. And I think as we continue to scale up the mobile business, have longer-tenured customers there as well as to improve our service activity that we'll continue to gain efficiency on the expense side for our internal expenses and drive additional profitability to the business that way as well."

[Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anniger. Please go ahead.\nStefan Anninger: Good morning and welcome to Charter\u2019s first quarter 2023 investor call. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com, under the Financial Information section. Before we proceed, I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-K and also our 10-Q filed this morning. We will not review those risk factors and other cautionary statements on this call. However, we encourage you to read them carefully.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management\u2019s current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements or to make additional forward-looking statements in the future. During the course of today\u2019s call, we will be referring to non-GAAP measures as defined and reconciled in our earnings materials. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar titles used by other companies. Please also note that all growth rates noted on this call and in the presentation are calculated on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise specified. On today\u2019s call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; Tom Rutledge, our Executive Chairman; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let\u2019s turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. During the first quarter, we added 76,000 Internet customers with contributions from our Spectrum One offering and our rural construction initiative. We continue to operate in a low transaction environment and yet we added 686,000 Spectrum Mobile lines. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6 million total mobile lines. Just over 10% of our Internet customers now have mobile service and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years and our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to Internet growth. We grew revenue and EBITDA by 3.4% and 2.6% respectively during the first quarter and our capital expenditures reflect progress on our key initiatives. This is a very unique time for the cable industry with generational opportunities across our three key initiatives, each of which is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth. The first initiative is evolution, which includes the most significant spectrum enhancement to the cable network since the late 1990s at a very low cost. Network evolution also includes the convergence of our connectivity products. Second is the largest expansion of our footprint since the 1980s, bringing broadband to unserved and underserved areas. And finally, execution, which is all about investing in and delivering great service. I will provide a brief update on these initiatives. Our network evolution plan is progressing well. We have now completed the physical work for high split in two midsized markets. We increased the network capacity to 1.2 gigahertz, which is equivalent to the acquisition of 400 megahertz of spectrum. We also allocated more spectrum for upstream use. In these markets, we are now capable of delivering 2 x 1 gigabit per second service and we are launching the same CMTS based 1.2 gigahertz high split to an additional 6 markets. These DMAs represent about 15% of our footprint. In parallel, we are preparing the second step of our network evolution plan, which will cover about 50% of our footprint and which adds the deployment of distributed access architecture, allowing us to deliver 5 x 1 gigabit per second speeds. Step three of our network evolution plan covers about 35% of our footprint and should begin in late 2024. That step adds a further expansion of our network to 1.8 gigahertz. We expect our network evolution initiative will be essentially complete by the end of 2025 at the previously noted $100 per passing target, excluding the benefit of any network savings, which will come. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve. Spectrum One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and spoke to Spectrum Mobile network each of which run on our advanced WiFi product. Today, over 40% of our residential Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, which just last month, we also launched to the SMB marketplace. Over 70% of our customers or mobile customers now use the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers in both promotional and retail pricing. So, our opportunity in converged connectivity in mobile is very large. We particularly like our ability to mix the lease economics of our 5G MVNO for the 10% to 15% of the time that our mobile customers don\u2019t have access to our faster Spectrum Mobile network. We have a strategic partner in Verizon and we are a meaningful contributor to active lines on this network and its financials. And when we look at the pricing and the usage of fixed wireless access disclosed by T-Mobile, it\u2019s clear that the MVNO price we pay per gigabyte is dramatically better than the economics mobile operators achieve with fixed wireless access offerings. In the expansion category, our plans are on track. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings. Subsidized rural passings growth is accelerating with 20,000 subsidized rural passings activated in March. Costs are coming in as planned and we have the labor, the equipment and the supply necessary to execute our build. If we get the pull permit support we need, we can complete our RDOF commitments 2 years ahead of the RDOF deadline. The pace of penetration gains in subsidized rule passings continues to exceed our expectations with 6-month penetrations at approximately 40%. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and customer satisfaction, ultimately driving faster customer growth. Our proactive maintenance efforts are fundamentally changing the customer experience. And using telemetry, we can address service impairments before customers even know they exist, pulling forward service calls that otherwise would have occurred and preventing service-related disconnects. We expect the mix of proactive truck rolls will increase significantly in the coming years. We are also seeing the benefits of our investments in training and tenure faster than expected. Employee retention among our frontline service employees during the first quarter was the best I have ever seen. And while investments in our employees generate upfront expense, they ultimately deliver longer tenured employees, which produce higher quality transactions, fewer repeat transactions, lower average handle times and better sales yields. So, increasing tenure also allows for a greater amount of our network evolution project to be performed with our own employees, which will save money and increase the quality of the upgrade. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms, where we have invested significantly in machine learning and the precursors to AI will further reduce transactions. More to come on that in the future quarters, but the key point here is that the combination of longer employee tenure, network evolution benefits, the conversion of our video platform to IP and digital service investments, all create a long runway for us to continue to reduce service transactions, operating cost and churn, which increases customer satisfaction, customer lifetime value and our returns. So ultimately, we are focused on doing everything that a customer would want us to do, investing in the network to offer even faster speeds, providing seamless connectivity products not available elsewhere, then bringing that same seamless connectivity to markets that have never had broadband before and delivering better customer service by investing in digital service platforms and a more tenured, more qualified service employee, all while helping save customers significant money in an inflationary environment. So, our strategy is focused on delivering differentiated converged connectivity products that essentially improves people\u2019s lives and creates value for shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to remind everyone that starting this quarter, we have made some changes to the way we report our P&L. First, we now include mobile service revenue in the residential and SMB revenue as appropriate and mobile equipment revenue is now reported in other revenue. On the expense side, we no longer report mobile expenses separately and those are now included in the applicable expense category. Ultimately, these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and offer structure. For additional information regarding these changes, please review Footnote A on Page 7 of the trending schedule we posted this morning. Now, let\u2019s turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 76,000 Internet customers in the first quarter. Video customers declined by $241,000 partly driven by a programming expense increase passed through in January of this year. Wireline voice declined by $220,000 and we added a record 686,000 mobile lines. Although our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the first quarter, market activity levels remain low. During the quarter, total churn was slightly higher than last year, but still near record lows and well below pre-pandemic levels. We have seen a small impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segment. Generally speaking, however, these customers typically exhibit higher levels of churn regardless of competition. And given the issues with fixed wireless product feeds, as confirmed by third-parties and questions surrounding that product\u2019s reliability and scalability, we expect fixed wireless customers to find their way back to us over time. We continue to drive very strong mobile growth with our high-quality, differentiated and attractively priced service. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from acquisition has increased significantly since the introduction of our Spectrum One product. And as we mentioned last quarter, our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn. As Chris mentioned, we also continue to perform well in rural areas. The new rural disclosures we issued today on Page 5 of our trending schedule show that we continue to see robust growth in rural passings. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings despite winter\u2019s construction seasonality. Penetration of subsidized rural passings continues to exceed our original target and these rural customers are purchasing products beyond Internet, including mobile, video and wireline voice. Moving to financial results starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers were down slightly with new customer growth driven by Internet offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.5% with promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower priced video packages within our base. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 2.5% year-over-year. And as a reminder, starting this quarter, our residential revenue now includes mobile service revenue, which grew from $387 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $497 million in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 2.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.1% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.3%. First quarter advertising revenue declined by 7.2% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 2.1% year-over-year driven by lower local and national advertising revenue offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 34% year-over-year primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher rural subsidies. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 3.4% year-over-year. Looking to second quarter revenue growth, I would remind you that we will lap April 22 rate adjustments and face the headwind of strong political advertising revenue in the prior year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7, in the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $316 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages partly offset by higher programming rates. Note that our first quarter programming costs included $50 million of favorable adjustments, which is similar in size to sports network rebates and other favorable adjustments we saw in the first quarter last year. Looking at the full year 2023, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 19.9% primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs. Cost to service customers increased by 6.9% year-over-year driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Partly offset by productivity improvements, as a result of the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting, our employee attrition declined more quickly than we had expected, which is allowing us to lower our normal hiring in the first half of this year and increase overall tenure and quality. Longer term, we continue to expect additional efficiencies and cost to service customers over time as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance, and network evolution investments. Sales and marketing costs grew by 7.6% primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile and other expenses grew by 6.7% driven by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by higher interest expense. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion in the first quarter, above last year\u2019s first quarter spend of $1.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $890 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $541 million in the prior quarter driven by Charter\u2019s subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities. I would also note that in the first quarter we saw a sequential decline in total CapEx associated with our subsidized rural construction initiative as we purchased a significant amount of rural construction equipment inventory as supply chain issues improved in the fourth quarter. First quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We spent more on upgrade rebuild given our network evolution initiative. Customer premise equipment, which includes installation costs, was higher year-over-year, and support capital was also up just given timing. Our expectations for full year 2023 capital expenditures have not changed in part, because the costs associated with our network evolution and rural construction initiatives are coming in as planned. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension and capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume that we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $664 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.8 billion in the first quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and an unfavorable change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices, which was typical seasonality for the first quarter but larger than last year. The year-over-year headwind was partly driven by outgoing payments related to the larger inventory buildup in Q4 of 2022 that I just mentioned. For the full year, however, we expect the change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices to be roughly neutral as our capital and payroll accruals should rise over the course of the year. Mobile device working capital will remain a headwind given the mismatch in timing between when we receive EIP payments and when we pay handset providers. Also, in the first quarter, we didn\u2019t make significant cash tax payments. And generally speaking, we make four federal cash tax payments a year with two quarterly payments made in the second quarter and one payment made in each of the third and fourth quarters. We\u2019re not changing our cash tax outlook that we provided on last quarter\u2019s call and simply providing a bit more clarity on the timing of cash tax payments. We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1 billion at an average price of $375 per share. Charter\u2019s bandwidth ridge 2-way network passes nearly 56 million homes and businesses with gigabit and converged services everywhere. And given the significant investments we\u2019ve made in that network over a multiyear period, we\u2019re now in a position to upgrade it further in both a cost-efficient and time-efficient manner to offer the fastest speeds and the most advanced telecommunication services in the country. Additionally, our scale and our capabilities are allowing us to rapidly expand that network, both to unserved and underserved areas through our rural construction initiative and to other high ROI expansion opportunities. Those initiatives, combined with our service-oriented operating strategy and prudent capital allocation, are poised to drive long-term customer growth, higher free cash flow and shareholder value. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Doug Mitchelson with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nDoug Mitchelson: Thanks so much. If I could do one for Chris, one for Jessica, Chris, on the go-to-market strategy for wireless, I\u2019m just curious what percentage of the wireless lines being created by the 12-month promotion you\u2019re hoping will convert to full pay after the promotional period expires. I think as part of that, we think about what\u2019s the data usage, how is that tracking for the promotional wireless lines versus the non-promotional lines or how many of your gross adds are phone numbers being ported in versus creating new phone numbers. Just trying to understand the revenue opportunity from that promotion, I certainly get the retention benefits? And then Jessica, you\u2019re not really sure what you\u2019re willing to say, but when you think about your prior commentary about labor investments impacting both 1Q and 2Q, should we start to think about a little bit more margin expansion in the back half of the year? Or any comments you\u2019re willing to make on swing factors for margins the remainder of the year would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: So Doug, I\u2019ll start it off with the go-to-market on Spectrum One. We have two offers out there today. One is for acquisition of Freeline together with Internet and essentially, the other one is if you purchase the line to give the second one for free for an existing customer. Those customers are great customers that have good usage, and they are getting the fastest product in the country from a connectivity standpoint. And when \u2013 I\u2019ve said it before, but when the promotional period rolls off, they are going to have not only the fastest connectivity product, but they are going to have the best price in the marketplace as well at $29.99. That includes taxes and fees, contracts. So it\u2019s a very, very attractive offer from a quality standpoint and from a pricing standpoint, not only at promotion but at retail. So our expectation is these are great customers. They are normal lines, and they are not going to be able to replicate the service or pricing that they are getting from us at retailer or promotion anywhere else in the marketplace. So our expectation is that it all sticks.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. I mean, Doug, we understand that there is some false market chatter. We should be clear on some other things. The majority of our gross adds are coming from paying lines. Less than 5% of our lines today are tablets, and those have the same rate plans as phones, and we don\u2019t include wearables in our numbers either. So the lines that we\u2019re putting up are good lines.\nChris Winfrey: One other thing to add to that this is not a moment in time. We were talking about it before the call. Our intent here is to grow and to grow more and to continue the path that we\u2019re on. So I think this is just the beginning, and we\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re doing, not just from a mobile perspective, but from an overall connectivity standpoint and the value that we can bring to customers both in qualitative product and save them a lot of money.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. To your question on margin and what happens in the second half of the year, the increases that you see both in sales and marketing expense and cost to serve right now and the year-over-year are really driven by strong mobile sales. But if you think about what happens to them for the rest of the year, in sales and marketing, if you look back at last year, 2Q \u201822 sales and marketing expense was sequentially lower than 1Q, which might put a little bit of pressure on the year-over-year comp in Q2. But the year-over-year growth rate of sales and marketing expense should moderate over the course of the second half of the year. We will have lapped our midyear 2022 staffing adjustments. And in Q4, we will lap the Spectrum One-related sales cost increase. Similarly, on the cost reserve side, I expect year-over-year growth in cost to serve to moderate in the second half of 2023, which I think is consistent with what we said before and end the year at growth levels that are more consistent with where we were \u2013 with where we\u2019ve been previously, which is largely flat. So I do think that as we go through the year to \u2013 in line with what we\u2019ve said, the business continues to become more efficient, and we continue to expect to be able to operate it more efficiently and generate and generate growth from them.\nChris Winfrey: And I\u2019d just add two quick things to that, Doug. One is on the cost side, if you think about all the OpEx and the CapEx investments that we\u2019ve talked about, it\u2019s really setting us up for a prolonged multiyear period of continuing lower cost to serve for customer relationship which will benefit our cash flow for years to come. But the other piece at the end of this year, if it ties back to your first question, we have a wall of good customers who are receiving a promotional rate today that are going to roll to a retail rate at $29.99 and stick. So you not only got the cost side that starts to lap the prior year investments, but you also have the revenue side that starts to kick in at the fourth quarter of this year, and that just gets better and better as we go.\nDoug Mitchelson: Yes. Thank you both. And thanks for the rural disclosures as well.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Doug.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks, Doug. Katy, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. I guess for either of you, just wanted to hear more about the kind of process of accelerating those rural build-outs. I think you talked about \u2013 I think it was March relative to the full first quarter. Is this the kind of \u2013 is it a simple \u2013 I mean not simple, but is it better weather allows for greater and faster construction? Just what are the puts and takes of getting that number even higher as we move through the rest of spring, summer through the year? And I think you put too fine of a point on it, but does the 6-month clock that you guys talk about start when homes are activated? I just want to make sure I got sort of the definitions around activated and marketed to, etcetera. So, just trying to get a sense of the rollout for the rest of this year? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Ben. The point you made about the seasonality with winter is right. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned in March, it was that it was much higher in terms of the already coming out of the back end. The full year target is 300,000 subs rural builds, and we intend to meet that we\u2019re on plan to meet that. So from an internal planning perspective, we\u2019re right on where we need to be \u2013 if you have to keep in mind that we \u2013 a lot of our build is taking place in places like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin. In January and February, there is a little bit harder to get around. Whether you\u2019re going on poles or whether you\u2019re going underground, it\u2019s a little harder in that environment. So nothing that we haven\u2019t expected and already coming out the back end, we\u2019re picking up. The \u2013 unless there is a more technical for Jessica, the \u2013 it\u2019s from activation that we start the clock for 0 to 6 months. So once the plant is constructed and it\u2019s opened up for marketing, that\u2019s the T minus zero, so to speak.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. Okay.\nJessica Fischer: The way it\u2019s being reported in the new trending schedule details. So you\u2019re getting those passings in sort of \u2013 in the reporting as the 6-month clock starts.\nBen Swinburne: Yes. And then just as a follow-up to Doug\u2019s question, and I don\u2019t like doing the battling earnings calls thing, but since it came up quite specifically last night on the T-Mobile call, these promotional lines, the additional lines you\u2019re adding, it sounds like those are lines being used and your expectation is as those roll to pay, those lines will continue to be lines. So I think they are \u2013 arguably these are not coming from anywhere. They are just being created. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that as you do roll to pay because it\u2019s obviously a decent piece of your line count? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Look, I always find it strange when somebody tries to do your IR for you, but we had a great quarter. These are great adds. We said what we said, and they are going to stick because it\u2019s high-quality product. It\u2019s the fastest in the market and it saves customers a ton of money. So beyond what we\u2019ve already said, I think we will leave it at that and continue to grow our line counts and we will do our own IR. Thank you.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks, Ben. Katy, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. And again, thanks for the rural disclosure. So it looks like if you pulled out the rural adds, you guys added about 50,000 subs. Just anything you can talk about in the core markets. If you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing sort of incrementally from a competitive standpoint, again, the fixed wireless guys are talking about bringing on more capacity and expanding into new markets. Does that become more of an issue as they rollout? And then you talked about this deployment of high split infrastructure. Would you expect to see better trends in those markets as you sort of turn on that service and improve, say, upstream capacity sort of along the way. So should we expect it to be something of an iterative process or where things get better as the infrastructure gets more competitive? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: Hey, John, so the \u2013 in the trending schedule, you\u2019ll see that the subsidized rural customers that were added inside the quarter were 17,000, which means the bulk of our net adds came from our existing footprint. So we\u2019re competing very well across the entire market. That includes both where we have existing \u2013 certainly existing fiber overbuild as well as where there is new fiber overbuild, and we\u2019re competing and more than holding our own in that footprint. We saw a little bit of softness, both in the gross adds and to a lesser extent, really on churn, but mostly in gross adds. Interestingly, the non-gigabit overbuild area because it\u2019s the first time that somebody has had an alternative, and so fixed wireless access in that marketplace seems like an interesting alternative until people find out ultimately that the throughput and the capabilities aren\u2019t the same as the broadband that we provide. So we\u2019re competing very well across all markets, just to be very clear, but that\u2019s the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing inside the legacy footprint. The passings that we\u2019re building that are subsidized rebuild, not only do we expect to have continuing improving performance spectrum, one of the legacy footprint but the passings that we\u2019re building from a rural standpoint just continue to get larger and would be a larger contributor to our growth over time. On high split, we\u2019re enhancing the spectrum availability of our network, which improves contention on the upstream as well as higher both downstream and upstream capabilities, which gives us marketing claims in the marketplace. But it also signals to competitors that we\u2019re \u2013 they are not going to have that marketing clean with us. And so the upstream is helpful, but I think it\u2019s more at this stage to have a significant marketing claim in the marketplace and we get a fair amount of network benefits from a quality standpoint in the actual network. And so we will get payback from both of those, both from competitiveness as well as essentially reduced truck roll and reduced node splits over time as well from what we\u2019re doing.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. If I could just follow-up or, is the goal is still to have higher adds this year than versus last year? Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: It is our goal to have higher net additions in Internet this year than we did last year.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it.\nTom Rutledge: Thanks, John. Thanks a lot. Katy, will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, guys. Thank you. Chris, I have to tell you it\u2019s a lot more fun from our side when companies do someone else\u2019s IR. So don\u2019t be shy.\nChris Winfrey: We won\u2019t step into that rut.\nPhil Cusick: Alright. First to follow-up on Jon. Jessica, you spoke in March about broadband activity through the quarter. Anything you can add about that? And any thoughts you have on sort of typical 2Q seasonality or anything different? And then in video, I understand a lot of video decline has been fewer broadband ads to connect to. But are you also seeing an acceleration in disconnects? And what percent of the base is now on these lower-cost packages? Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So Phil, talking about going into Q2. Q2 is always a seasonally more difficult quarter. But in terms of trends, we did continue to see what I sort of had said in \u2013 at the end of February, and that I think that our trends looked a little better across coming in and in March than they had in February, which was better than January. And we continue to see that now with the context of Q2 being kind of what it is. So I think that we continue to think that the things look pretty good or at least better than it was previously on that front.\nChris Winfrey: So I\u2019ll take the video. There is a pretty clear correlation to when we\u2019ve taken rate increases either on video or even a more recent increase that we had on the Internet. So there is a downgrade element that takes place at the point of programming pass-through, which we\u2019ve had to do because of where the programmers have been. And I also think in addition to that, because the point-of-sale discussion with the customer has been focused on Internet and mobile, the length of that conversation is a little longer. And I think there are things that we can do to have a better attach rate to a video at the point of sale now and certainly in the future, as we think about the rollout of Xumo towards the back half of this year. It\u2019s a very compelling product. It\u2019s very simple. It\u2019s straightforward. It has a tremendous amount of utility towards customers for both their OTT as well as any live video viewing and subscriptions that they have. As I\u2019ve said it before, it\u2019s the platform that I\u2019d like to have on all of my TVs. And I think it\u2019s going to be very attractive to customers and I think it has the opportunity to really improve our trajectory on video as well in a profitable way.\nPhil Cusick: Will Xumo be reported as a regular video sub or you will have a different category for that?\nChris Winfrey: We haven\u2019t gotten through all the reporting definitions yet, but I think the right way to think about it is to the extent the customer takes a video service from Charter, then it would be reported as a video PSU. And to the extent it\u2019s just a platform that we are distributing that our customers can use as connectivity plus customers, then likely, it\u2019s just going to be a Xumo unit and it will be an added benefit to our existing connectivity relationship. But I reserve the right to take that out loud together with Jessica over time. But I think that\u2019s the more natural way it will go.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. And as we get closer to the rollout, we will try to provide some additional information on where we think that, that will land.\nPhil Cusick: Thanks again.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks Phil.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Phil. Katy, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Supino with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nPeter Supino: Good morning. Thank you. On the subject of your truly gaudy mobile results, could you discuss the evolution of device promotions as part of your mobile strategy and whether we should be modeling use of cash for device promotions in the future?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. I think the device business and that\u2019s not why we got into mobile. And we got into mobile to provide the fastest connectivity service and to save customers money on their monthly overall connectivity service and to bring convergence, a product that doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere, but Charter and cable generally today. So, never say never but we don\u2019t see a need, and we don\u2019t have any plans to be aggressively into the subsidy business from a device standpoint. We don\u2019t need to because we provide significant value, best fees, the best product and the best amount of savings already with what we are \u2013 our go-to-market strategy today.\nPeter Supino: Thanks Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Peter. Katy, we will take our next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks guys. Two questions. The early work that we have done on suggests the returns in those markets could be phenomenal, potentially double what you guys may be seeing in RDOF markets if the full subsidy is awarded. I am wondering if you can help size what the opportunity could be. I think you got like roughly 20% of the RDOF opportunity? Could it be something of that magnitude of the BEAD opportunity? And then as we total up broadband ads in the industry, it looks like there has been a bit of a slowdown for the overall industry this quarter. I am wondering if you have got any context for what might be driving that. Is it just a pull forward of growth from COVID from the sort of period of higher growth during COVID, or is there something else going on? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So, I would start first saying the RDOF returns that we have are extremely attractive. And then that we are really pleased with what we are doing, both on RDOF as well as the other state brands that were coming out of some of the ARPA and other COVID funds. And that\u2019s been highly successful. On BEAD, it\u2019s really too early to tell. We have been very successful where we have gone into different subsidy, RFPs simply because we are aggressive and because we are the most experienced rural builder in the entire country. So, when we go tell a Local, State or Federal government that we are going to build, and we are going to build within a certain timeline, we have probably the most \u2013 not probably, we have the most credibility because we are the largest rural provider. Today, we the largest rural builder and we have won awards for the success and the quality of what we do. And we have the ability not just to bring broadband into these rural communities, but we have the ability to save customers, significant amounts of money on their already high mobile builds as well as bring video into these places. So, it\u2019s not just a single play Internet. We bring a whole suite of connectivity services that save customers money. We have been successful and so \u2013 both economically as well as from a quality standpoint, our success rate is high and our credibility is very good. But in terms of what we win in BEAD, it\u2019s certainly, it\u2019s factored into some of our outlook on CapEx, but time will tell how successful we can really be on that front. But I am bullish I think we are going to do well.\nJessica Fischer: The thing that I would add to that is that, Jonathan, we have a very disciplined sort of practice now and how we bid for these offerings. And so we are very comfortable with our ability to price the passings with our ability to then bid for an appropriate amount of subsidy against that and then to go on the back end and execute against building the passings in a way that\u2019s cost-effective and that generates the returns that we set out for. So, there is a hypothetical math exercise that you can do to try to get to what we would win. But what I would be clear about is what we win we will win at good returns, and we will execute it on the back end and bring those returns back into the company.\nChris Winfrey: Yes. We have great visibility to our cost. We have supply and labor equipment all lined up, and we know what it costs in each of these different markets already. So, our experience to-date is really going to bode well for giving us confidence in what we bid on. On the overall broadband market, I do think that there continues to be the headwind of all the COVID volume that was pulled forward in the broadband market and in combination of just a lower transaction, lower moving environment. And so I think the entire market is still suffering from that as a little bit as well as a small swing back into wireless substitution. So, we are seeing some of that as well. Housing starts also been down, so that clearly contributes into this as well, and all of which I think is temporary in nature. The difficulty that I think if you hear from the entire industry is when is it going to come back to normal and none of us really have a crystal ball. But I think if I listen to what others are saying or including our peers, we all \u2013 there is no reason to think that we don\u2019t get back into the normalized market environment. It\u2019s just become very difficult to predict exactly when that happens. In the meantime, we compete well. We are growing both in legacy markets as well as obviously in our new build area. And through a combination of market normalization as well as a very large pipeline of un-served rural passings that we are constructing, the opportunity for growth in Internet as well as in mobile is very good for us.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Jonathan. Katy, we will take our next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about wireless margins, Jessica. You shared one more quarter of wireless results. And I think it\u2019s \u2013 while I sort of get that the remarkable pace of subscriber growth means customer acquisition cost is very high, it also leaves \u2013 it leaves sort of to the imagination how the business will actually scale over time. So, anything you could share with us about underlying wireless margins or customer lifetime values of wireless subscribers? And in particular, what traffic you might offload and how that might affect it going forward would be very helpful? Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So Craig, I think back in December, we actually gave where we are in terms of margin in the business exclude \u2013 income in the business, excluding customer acquisition costs. And we showed there that if we run it as a \u2013 if we ran it as a standalone business which we don\u2019t but that we would make good margins in the business. We certainly have work that you have been doing trying to use some of the financial information available out there to back into costs. Obviously, I am not going to comment on exactly what those were, but you might have heard from us if we thought that you were materially incorrect on them \u2013 or from someone else for that matter. It\u2019s important, though, to step back and think about, we don\u2019t run the wireless business just for margin in the wireless business. We run our entire business to generate the most cash flow on \u2013 the most cash flow per passing that we can across the network. And that means that you have to have more customers, which means you have to price at a value, and it means that you have to generate more money per customer, and we believe in doing that by adding services to the customer, which we do by adding wireless to our current broadband, video and voice customer base. And we also are seeing that there is benefits to having those products bundled together, not just in the form of driving better pricing for our customers, which we will do, but in the form of reducing churn and ultimately, we think also increasing what we can do in terms of customer acquisition across both the broadband and the wireless product as they become sort of a converged connectivity experience. So, we are really confident in our ability to continue to have a financial benefit from the wireless business going forward because of the value that it adds to what we can provide to the customer and the resulting increased cash flow that we get on a customer-by-customer basis when those customers take more products from us, including the wireless product.\nChris Winfrey: Craig, on the traffic offload, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have now deployed spectrum mobile network to all capable devices, which is our advanced WiFi service, and that\u2019s in 40% of our residential customers. We have now begun to launch that advanced WiFi service and Spectrum Mobile network to SMB as well. So, up until this point, the vast majority of the traffic offload has been inside of an existing customer\u2019s household and hasn\u2019t given the ability for them to do significant amounts of offload outside the household and special local network really over the course of the past four months or five months is accelerating that ability to have traffic offload. And that\u2019s prior to us fully deploying CBRS, which we intend to do. And we are already live in one large market. It\u2019s going very well. So, whereas I think we had publicly said that we had 15% of our usage was through the lease of the 5G MVNO network. That\u2019s now decreasing already pretty quickly. And so the 85% that was on our network before is now moving up to 87%, just in a matter of months, and that will continue to increase over time as we deploy more Spectrum Mobile network through advanced WiFi as well as CBRS over time. And so it\u2019s attractive today, and it will continue to be more attractive. And the profitability and the cash flow today is really tied up in the subscriber acquisition cost.\nCraig Moffett: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Craig. Katy, we will take our next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jessica Ehrlich with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJessica Ehrlich: Thank you. Two questions. One on mobile pricing longer term, I mean do you think this is similar to broadband when you guys entered the market decades ago at a significant discount to telecom and then grew it over time as your share grew? So, just kind of how you are thinking about it longer term? And then second on Xumo, can you remind us what the timing of the rollout is? But also on advertising, can you compare it to linear? Like, how are you thinking about it in terms of inventory load, CPMs? I mean, it seems like you will have a lot more data.\nChris Winfrey: So, I will take the \u2013 you may need to come \u2013 circle back and remind us what your question was on the broadband. I wasn\u2019t sure I completely followed it. I think it was had the corollaries to mobile. But on Xumo, back half of this year, we haven\u2019t announced a month the progress of the Xumo team, it\u2019s going very well. The product looks great. And so we expect to be deployed \u2013 fully deployed as Charter at the end of this year. The advertising business will come through several places. One is live video where you can think of that as connected TV CPMs. We have that today. We have the largest spectrum. We have the largest app delivery of essentially a virtual MVPD of anybody in the country because of the way that our app is used. And so we monetize through higher CPMs of connected TV spots today that will be amplified through the Xumo platform. And then in addition to that, Xumo will have its share similar to any other connected TV platform of advertising and subscription revenue. And some of those advertising spots will be conveyed to the affiliate, which in this case would be us. And so we expect to participate both as an equity holder in Xumo and its advertising revenue model as well as a way to amplify our own existing advertising revenue streams that we have today.\nJessica Fischer: On the longer term question on mobile pricing and sort of where we go there, I think the most important thing to \u2013 for us to worry about right now is that we are trying to take share in that market and to take share. We are priced to take share. And while we are doing that, we are still able to make good margins on that product. And so I don\u2019t think that there is some sort of long-term pricing game to think about right now. Our \u2013 what we are really thinking about is what we do to take share in the market to provide mobile service to more of our customers, the fastest and best priced in the industry, and to use that to generate cash flow for the business.\nChris Winfrey: Longer term, if you think about it, there is two ways to think about it, just to pontificate. One is, is mobile really a product, or is it just an attribute of our connectivity service. And over time is their ability to create an entirely new category of seamless connectivity. Today, mobile lines are sold at an individual level and broadband sold at a household level. Today, they are sitting on two separate bills. And I am not sure that either of those need to be true in the future. It could be a single product that none of our competitors have, and none of our competitors have a path to replicate. So, that\u2019s one way of thinking about it. Another is instead of thinking about it as broadband is to think about it as a corollary is to think about it what we did in the telephone space, the wireline telephone space, where we used it as a significant way to \u2013 for a prolonged period of time to save customers a significant amount of money and drive connectivity and other products that we had by saving the money through an over-the-top product where we had a better mouse trap. And we didn\u2019t have a bunch of high-priced legacy revenue that we had to worry about. We could be aggressive in the marketplace. And I think those notions, they go hand-in-hand. We have talked about Spectrum One and how that may evolve over time in terms of we may try different ways to go to market that could include pricing, packaging, billing to really create potentially a brand-new category in the space.\nJessica Ehrlich: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Jessica. Operator, we will take our last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks and good morning. Two topics. First, I was curious if you could share more details on the activity you are seeing in the business segment, any changes in behavior of your customers since the beginning of the year? And if this macro backdrop is having any specific impact for Charter, positive or negative, on how it\u2019s been performing? And then just one other on the ACP, just curious how many ACP subscribers that Charter currently has and how this program is contributing to the broadband performance?\nChris Winfrey: Michael, I will take those. In the business, it\u2019s different between SMB and enterprise. Honestly, SMB is a little bit soft right now. We are still growing. You can see that in our numbers. But the SMB space has been a little soft. I don\u2019t think we are alone in seeing that. And I also think that fixed wireless access may be selling cheap, low-quality residential products into a lower portion of the SMB space. It\u2019s \u2013 we see some evidence of that. I think that\u2019s temporary. As it relates to enterprise, we are doing very well in enterprise, the retail side. Clearly, we have ongoing cell tower backhaul revenue pressure. But in the retail space for enterprise, whether it\u2019s fiber Internet access, Ethernet, our managed services, our UCaaS services, we are actually doing very well. It takes a while to activate sales, but I think we had our best sales quarter ever in Q1 pre-activation. So, the enterprise space is doing well and expect the retail piece to continue to grow well and to actually to accelerate. On ACP, we are not going to get into specific numbers other than to say \u2013 it\u2019s a big program for the government. It\u2019s important to the government, and we have been very active in deploying ACP at their request. It\u2019s been very successful. The vast majority of the customers we have were already existing customers who are now benefiting from that benefit. And we are \u2013 we believe, the largest ACP participant. And we are hopeful that the government continues to renew that program over time because we think it\u2019s a good program and it\u2019s been important, and it\u2019s a good benefit in the marketplace.\nMichael Rollins: Thanks.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks Michael. Back to you Katy.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Stefan Anninger for any closing remarks.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks everyone and we will see you next quarter.\nChris Winfrey: Thank you.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. During the first quarter, we added 76,000 Internet customers with contributions from our Spectrum One offering and our rural construction initiative. We continue to operate in a low transaction environment and yet we added 686,000 Spectrum Mobile lines. At the end of the first quarter, we had 6 million total mobile lines. Just over 10% of our Internet customers now have mobile service and we expect mobile penetration to meaningfully grow over the next several years and our increasing convergence capabilities will contribute to Internet growth. We grew revenue and EBITDA by 3.4% and 2.6% respectively during the first quarter and our capital expenditures reflect progress on our key initiatives. This is a very unique time for the cable industry with generational opportunities across our three key initiatives, each of which is designed to drive customer growth and long-term cash flow growth. The first initiative is evolution, which includes the most significant spectrum enhancement to the cable network since the late 1990s at a very low cost. Network evolution also includes the convergence of our connectivity products. Second is the largest expansion of our footprint since the 1980s, bringing broadband to unserved and underserved areas. And finally, execution, which is all about investing in and delivering great service. I will provide a brief update on these initiatives. Our network evolution plan is progressing well. We have now completed the physical work for high split in two midsized markets. We increased the network capacity to 1.2 gigahertz, which is equivalent to the acquisition of 400 megahertz of spectrum. We also allocated more spectrum for upstream use. In these markets, we are now capable of delivering 2 x 1 gigabit per second service and we are launching the same CMTS based 1.2 gigahertz high split to an additional 6 markets. These DMAs represent about 15% of our footprint. In parallel, we are preparing the second step of our network evolution plan, which will cover about 50% of our footprint and which adds the deployment of distributed access architecture, allowing us to deliver 5 x 1 gigabit per second speeds. Step three of our network evolution plan covers about 35% of our footprint and should begin in late 2024. That step adds a further expansion of our network to 1.8 gigahertz. We expect our network evolution initiative will be essentially complete by the end of 2025 at the previously noted $100 per passing target, excluding the benefit of any network savings, which will come. Our converged product offering also continues to evolve. Spectrum One is performing well in the marketplace. It offers the fastest connectivity and includes differentiated features like Mobile Speed Boost and spoke to Spectrum Mobile network each of which run on our advanced WiFi product. Today, over 40% of our residential Internet customers have our advanced WiFi product, which just last month, we also launched to the SMB marketplace. Over 70% of our customers or mobile customers now use the Spectrum Mobile network outside of their homes. Spectrum One also offers significant savings for customers in both promotional and retail pricing. So, our opportunity in converged connectivity in mobile is very large. We particularly like our ability to mix the lease economics of our 5G MVNO for the 10% to 15% of the time that our mobile customers don't have access to our faster Spectrum Mobile network. We have a strategic partner in Verizon and we are a meaningful contributor to active lines on this network and its financials. And when we look at the pricing and the usage of fixed wireless access disclosed by T-Mobile, it's clear that the MVNO price we pay per gigabyte is dramatically better than the economics mobile operators achieve with fixed wireless access offerings. In the expansion category, our plans are on track. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings. Subsidized rural passings growth is accelerating with 20,000 subsidized rural passings activated in March. Costs are coming in as planned and we have the labor, the equipment and the supply necessary to execute our build. If we get the pull permit support we need, we can complete our RDOF commitments 2 years ahead of the RDOF deadline. The pace of penetration gains in subsidized rule passings continues to exceed our expectations with 6-month penetrations at approximately 40%. And finally, we remain committed to the execution of our core operating strategy, which prioritizes customer experience and customer satisfaction, ultimately driving faster customer growth. Our proactive maintenance efforts are fundamentally changing the customer experience. And using telemetry, we can address service impairments before customers even know they exist, pulling forward service calls that otherwise would have occurred and preventing service-related disconnects. We expect the mix of proactive truck rolls will increase significantly in the coming years. We are also seeing the benefits of our investments in training and tenure faster than expected. Employee retention among our frontline service employees during the first quarter was the best I have ever seen. And while investments in our employees generate upfront expense, they ultimately deliver longer tenured employees, which produce higher quality transactions, fewer repeat transactions, lower average handle times and better sales yields. So, increasing tenure also allows for a greater amount of our network evolution project to be performed with our own employees, which will save money and increase the quality of the upgrade. Additionally, the increasing digitization of our service platforms, where we have invested significantly in machine learning and the precursors to AI will further reduce transactions. More to come on that in the future quarters, but the key point here is that the combination of longer employee tenure, network evolution benefits, the conversion of our video platform to IP and digital service investments, all create a long runway for us to continue to reduce service transactions, operating cost and churn, which increases customer satisfaction, customer lifetime value and our returns. So ultimately, we are focused on doing everything that a customer would want us to do, investing in the network to offer even faster speeds, providing seamless connectivity products not available elsewhere, then bringing that same seamless connectivity to markets that have never had broadband before and delivering better customer service by investing in digital service platforms and a more tenured, more qualified service employee, all while helping save customers significant money in an inflationary environment. So, our strategy is focused on delivering differentiated converged connectivity products that essentially improves people's lives and creates value for shareholders. Now, I will turn the call over to Jessica. So Doug, I'll start it off with the go-to-market on Spectrum One. We have two offers out there today. One is for acquisition of Freeline together with Internet and essentially, the other one is if you purchase the line to give the second one for free for an existing customer. Those customers are great customers that have good usage, and they are getting the fastest product in the country from a connectivity standpoint. And when \u2013 I've said it before, but when the promotional period rolls off, they are going to have not only the fastest connectivity product, but they are going to have the best price in the marketplace as well at $29.99. That includes taxes and fees, contracts. So it's a very, very attractive offer from a quality standpoint and from a pricing standpoint, not only at promotion but at retail. So our expectation is these are great customers. They are normal lines, and they are not going to be able to replicate the service or pricing that they are getting from us at retailer or promotion anywhere else in the marketplace. So our expectation is that it all sticks. One other thing to add to that this is not a moment in time. We were talking about it before the call. Our intent here is to grow and to grow more and to continue the path that we're on. So I think this is just the beginning, and we're excited about what we're doing, not just from a mobile perspective, but from an overall connectivity standpoint and the value that we can bring to customers both in qualitative product and save them a lot of money. And I'd just add two quick things to that, Doug. One is on the cost side, if you think about all the OpEx and the CapEx investments that we've talked about, it's really setting us up for a prolonged multiyear period of continuing lower cost to serve for customer relationship which will benefit our cash flow for years to come. But the other piece at the end of this year, if it ties back to your first question, we have a wall of good customers who are receiving a promotional rate today that are going to roll to a retail rate at $29.99 and stick. So you not only got the cost side that starts to lap the prior year investments, but you also have the revenue side that starts to kick in at the fourth quarter of this year, and that just gets better and better as we go. Thanks, Ben. The point you made about the seasonality with winter is right. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned in March, it was that it was much higher in terms of the already coming out of the back end. The full year target is 300,000 subs rural builds, and we intend to meet that we're on plan to meet that. So from an internal planning perspective, we're right on where we need to be \u2013 if you have to keep in mind that we \u2013 a lot of our build is taking place in places like Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin. In January and February, there is a little bit harder to get around. Whether you're going on poles or whether you're going underground, it's a little harder in that environment. So nothing that we haven't expected and already coming out the back end, we're picking up. The \u2013 unless there is a more technical for Jessica, the \u2013 it's from activation that we start the clock for 0 to 6 months. So once the plant is constructed and it's opened up for marketing, that's the T minus zero, so to speak. Look, I always find it strange when somebody tries to do your IR for you, but we had a great quarter. These are great adds. We said what we said, and they are going to stick because it's high-quality product. It's the fastest in the market and it saves customers a ton of money. So beyond what we've already said, I think we will leave it at that and continue to grow our line counts and we will do our own IR. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, John, so the \u2013 in the trending schedule, you'll see that the subsidized rural customers that were added inside the quarter were 17,000, which means the bulk of our net adds came from our existing footprint. So we're competing very well across the entire market. That includes both where we have existing \u2013 certainly existing fiber overbuild as well as where there is new fiber overbuild, and we're competing and more than holding our own in that footprint. We saw a little bit of softness, both in the gross adds and to a lesser extent, really on churn, but mostly in gross adds. Interestingly, the non-gigabit overbuild area because it's the first time that somebody has had an alternative, and so fixed wireless access in that marketplace seems like an interesting alternative until people find out ultimately that the throughput and the capabilities aren't the same as the broadband that we provide. So we're competing very well across all markets, just to be very clear, but that's the dynamics that we're seeing inside the legacy footprint. The passings that we're building that are subsidized rebuild, not only do we expect to have continuing improving performance spectrum, one of the legacy footprint but the passings that we're building from a rural standpoint just continue to get larger and would be a larger contributor to our growth over time. On high split, we're enhancing the spectrum availability of our network, which improves contention on the upstream as well as higher both downstream and upstream capabilities, which gives us marketing claims in the marketplace. But it also signals to competitors that we're \u2013 they are not going to have that marketing clean with us. And so the upstream is helpful, but I think it's more at this stage to have a significant marketing claim in the marketplace and we get a fair amount of network benefits from a quality standpoint in the actual network. And so we will get payback from both of those, both from competitiveness as well as essentially reduced truck roll and reduced node splits over time as well from what we're doing. It is our goal to have higher net additions in Internet this year than we did last year. We won't step into that rut. So I'll take the video. There is a pretty clear correlation to when we've taken rate increases either on video or even a more recent increase that we had on the Internet. So there is a downgrade element that takes place at the point of programming pass-through, which we've had to do because of where the programmers have been. And I also think in addition to that, because the point-of-sale discussion with the customer has been focused on Internet and mobile, the length of that conversation is a little longer. And I think there are things that we can do to have a better attach rate to a video at the point of sale now and certainly in the future, as we think about the rollout of Xumo towards the back half of this year. It's a very compelling product. It's very simple. It's straightforward. It has a tremendous amount of utility towards customers for both their OTT as well as any live video viewing and subscriptions that they have. As I've said it before, it's the platform that I'd like to have on all of my TVs. And I think it's going to be very attractive to customers and I think it has the opportunity to really improve our trajectory on video as well in a profitable way. We haven't gotten through all the reporting definitions yet, but I think the right way to think about it is to the extent the customer takes a video service from Charter, then it would be reported as a video PSU. And to the extent it's just a platform that we are distributing that our customers can use as connectivity plus customers, then likely, it's just going to be a Xumo unit and it will be an added benefit to our existing connectivity relationship. But I reserve the right to take that out loud together with Jessica over time. But I think that's the more natural way it will go. Thanks Phil. Sure. I think the device business and that's not why we got into mobile. And we got into mobile to provide the fastest connectivity service and to save customers money on their monthly overall connectivity service and to bring convergence, a product that doesn't really exist anywhere, but Charter and cable generally today. So, never say never but we don't see a need, and we don't have any plans to be aggressively into the subsidy business from a device standpoint. We don't need to because we provide significant value, best fees, the best product and the best amount of savings already with what we are \u2013 our go-to-market strategy today. So, I would start first saying the RDOF returns that we have are extremely attractive. And then that we are really pleased with what we are doing, both on RDOF as well as the other state brands that were coming out of some of the ARPA and other COVID funds. And that's been highly successful. On BEAD, it's really too early to tell. We have been very successful where we have gone into different subsidy, RFPs simply because we are aggressive and because we are the most experienced rural builder in the entire country. So, when we go tell a Local, State or Federal government that we are going to build, and we are going to build within a certain timeline, we have probably the most \u2013 not probably, we have the most credibility because we are the largest rural provider. Today, we the largest rural builder and we have won awards for the success and the quality of what we do. And we have the ability not just to bring broadband into these rural communities, but we have the ability to save customers, significant amounts of money on their already high mobile builds as well as bring video into these places. So, it's not just a single play Internet. We bring a whole suite of connectivity services that save customers money. We have been successful and so \u2013 both economically as well as from a quality standpoint, our success rate is high and our credibility is very good. But in terms of what we win in BEAD, it's certainly, it's factored into some of our outlook on CapEx, but time will tell how successful we can really be on that front. But I am bullish I think we are going to do well. Yes. We have great visibility to our cost. We have supply and labor equipment all lined up, and we know what it costs in each of these different markets already. So, our experience to-date is really going to bode well for giving us confidence in what we bid on. On the overall broadband market, I do think that there continues to be the headwind of all the COVID volume that was pulled forward in the broadband market and in combination of just a lower transaction, lower moving environment. And so I think the entire market is still suffering from that as a little bit as well as a small swing back into wireless substitution. So, we are seeing some of that as well. Housing starts also been down, so that clearly contributes into this as well, and all of which I think is temporary in nature. The difficulty that I think if you hear from the entire industry is when is it going to come back to normal and none of us really have a crystal ball. But I think if I listen to what others are saying or including our peers, we all \u2013 there is no reason to think that we don't get back into the normalized market environment. It's just become very difficult to predict exactly when that happens. In the meantime, we compete well. We are growing both in legacy markets as well as obviously in our new build area. And through a combination of market normalization as well as a very large pipeline of un-served rural passings that we are constructing, the opportunity for growth in Internet as well as in mobile is very good for us. Craig, on the traffic offload, I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have now deployed spectrum mobile network to all capable devices, which is our advanced WiFi service, and that's in 40% of our residential customers. We have now begun to launch that advanced WiFi service and Spectrum Mobile network to SMB as well. So, up until this point, the vast majority of the traffic offload has been inside of an existing customer's household and hasn't given the ability for them to do significant amounts of offload outside the household and special local network really over the course of the past four months or five months is accelerating that ability to have traffic offload. And that's prior to us fully deploying CBRS, which we intend to do. And we are already live in one large market. It's going very well. So, whereas I think we had publicly said that we had 15% of our usage was through the lease of the 5G MVNO network. That's now decreasing already pretty quickly. And so the 85% that was on our network before is now moving up to 87%, just in a matter of months, and that will continue to increase over time as we deploy more Spectrum Mobile network through advanced WiFi as well as CBRS over time. And so it's attractive today, and it will continue to be more attractive. And the profitability and the cash flow today is really tied up in the subscriber acquisition cost. So, I will take the \u2013 you may need to come \u2013 circle back and remind us what your question was on the broadband. I wasn't sure I completely followed it. I think it was had the corollaries to mobile. But on Xumo, back half of this year, we haven't announced a month the progress of the Xumo team, it's going very well. The product looks great. And so we expect to be deployed \u2013 fully deployed as Charter at the end of this year. The advertising business will come through several places. One is live video where you can think of that as connected TV CPMs. We have that today. We have the largest spectrum. We have the largest app delivery of essentially a virtual MVPD of anybody in the country because of the way that our app is used. And so we monetize through higher CPMs of connected TV spots today that will be amplified through the Xumo platform. And then in addition to that, Xumo will have its share similar to any other connected TV platform of advertising and subscription revenue. And some of those advertising spots will be conveyed to the affiliate, which in this case would be us. And so we expect to participate both as an equity holder in Xumo and its advertising revenue model as well as a way to amplify our own existing advertising revenue streams that we have today. Longer term, if you think about it, there is two ways to think about it, just to pontificate. One is, is mobile really a product, or is it just an attribute of our connectivity service. And over time is their ability to create an entirely new category of seamless connectivity. Today, mobile lines are sold at an individual level and broadband sold at a household level.

We have talked about Spectrum One and how that may evolve over time in terms of we may try different ways to go to market that could include pricing, packaging, billing to really create potentially a brand-new category in the space. Michael, I will take those. In the business, it's different between SMB and enterprise. Honestly, SMB is a little bit soft right now. We are still growing. You can see that in our numbers. But the SMB space has been a little soft. I don't think we are alone in seeing that.

It's important to the government, and we have been very active in deploying ACP at their request. It's been very successful. The vast majority of the customers we have were already existing customers who are now benefiting from that benefit. And we are \u2013 we believe, the largest ACP participant. And we are hopeful that the government continues to renew that program over time because we think it's a good program and it's been important, and it's a good benefit in the marketplace. Thank you."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our first quarter results, I want to remind everyone that starting this quarter, we have made some changes to the way we report our P&L. First, we now include mobile service revenue in the residential and SMB revenue as appropriate and mobile equipment revenue is now reported in other revenue. On the expense side, we no longer report mobile expenses separately and those are now included in the applicable expense category. Ultimately, these changes better reflect the converged and integrated nature of our mobile business and our operations and offer structure. For additional information regarding these changes, please review Footnote A on Page 7 of the trending schedule we posted this morning. Now, let's turn to our customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we added 76,000 Internet customers in the first quarter. Video customers declined by $241,000 partly driven by a programming expense increase passed through in January of this year. Wireline voice declined by $220,000 and we added a record 686,000 mobile lines. Although our Internet customer growth continued to be positive in the first quarter, market activity levels remain low. During the quarter, total churn was slightly higher than last year, but still near record lows and well below pre-pandemic levels. We have seen a small impact from fixed wireless access competitors in the price-sensitive customer segment. Generally speaking, however, these customers typically exhibit higher levels of churn regardless of competition. And given the issues with fixed wireless product feeds, as confirmed by third-parties and questions surrounding that product's reliability and scalability, we expect fixed wireless customers to find their way back to us over time. We continue to drive very strong mobile growth with our high-quality, differentiated and attractively priced service. The majority of new lines continue to come from existing Internet customers, though the percentage of lines coming from acquisition has increased significantly since the introduction of our Spectrum One product. And as we mentioned last quarter, our converged customers have meaningfully lower Internet and customer relationship churn. As Chris mentioned, we also continue to perform well in rural areas. The new rural disclosures we issued today on Page 5 of our trending schedule show that we continue to see robust growth in rural passings. During the quarter, we activated 44,000 subsidized rural passings despite winter's construction seasonality. Penetration of subsidized rural passings continues to exceed our original target and these rural customers are purchasing products beyond Internet, including mobile, video and wireline voice. Moving to financial results starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers were down slightly with new customer growth driven by Internet offset by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 2.5% with promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower priced video packages within our base. As Slide 6 shows, residential revenue grew by 2.5% year-over-year. And as a reminder, starting this quarter, our residential revenue now includes mobile service revenue, which grew from $387 million in the first quarter of 2022 to $497 million in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to commercial. SMB revenue grew by 2% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 2.4%. Enterprise revenue was up by 3.1% year-over-year. Enterprise PSUs grew by 4.9% year-over-year. And excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 7.3%. First quarter advertising revenue declined by 7.2% year-over-year due to less political revenue. Core ad revenue was down 2.1% year-over-year driven by lower local and national advertising revenue offset by our growing advanced advertising capabilities. Other revenue grew by 34% year-over-year primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher rural subsidies. In total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 3.4% year-over-year. Looking to second quarter revenue growth, I would remind you that we will lap April 22 rate adjustments and face the headwind of strong political advertising revenue in the prior year. Moving to operating expenses and EBITDA on Slide 7, in the first quarter, total operating expenses grew by $316 million or 3.9% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 6% year-over-year due to a decline in video customers of 5.2% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages partly offset by higher programming rates. Note that our first quarter programming costs included $50 million of favorable adjustments, which is similar in size to sports network rebates and other favorable adjustments we saw in the first quarter last year. Looking at the full year 2023, we continue to expect programming cost per video customer to be approximately flat year-over-year. Other cost of revenue increased by 19.9% primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and other mobile direct costs. Cost to service customers increased by 6.9% year-over-year driven by adjustments to job structure, pay and benefits to build a more skilled and longer tenured workforce, resulting in lower frontline employee attrition compared to 2022 and additional activity to support the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile. Partly offset by productivity improvements, as a result of the programs we discussed at our December investor meeting, our employee attrition declined more quickly than we had expected, which is allowing us to lower our normal hiring in the first half of this year and increase overall tenure and quality. Longer term, we continue to expect additional efficiencies and cost to service customers over time as a result of our continuing lower service transactions, service tenure and digital service investments, proactive maintenance, and network evolution investments. Sales and marketing costs grew by 7.6% primarily driven by higher staffing across sales channels and the accelerated growth of Spectrum Mobile and other expenses grew by 6.7% driven by higher labor costs. Adjusted EBITDA grew 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter. Turning to net income on Slide 8, we generated $1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, down from $1.2 billion last year with higher adjusted EBITDA more than offset by higher interest expense. Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion in the first quarter, above last year's first quarter spend of $1.9 billion. The increase was primarily driven by higher spend on line extensions, which totaled $890 million in the first quarter of 2023 compared to $541 million in the prior quarter driven by Charter's subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities. I would also note that in the first quarter we saw a sequential decline in total CapEx associated with our subsidized rural construction initiative as we purchased a significant amount of rural construction equipment inventory as supply chain issues improved in the fourth quarter. First quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.6 billion compared to $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2022. We spent more on upgrade rebuild given our network evolution initiative. Customer premise equipment, which includes installation costs, was higher year-over-year, and support capital was also up just given timing. Our expectations for full year 2023 capital expenditures have not changed in part, because the costs associated with our network evolution and rural construction initiatives are coming in as planned. For the full year, we continue to expect capital expenditures excluding line extensions to be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. Following the expected completion of our network evolution initiative at the end of 2025 or the beginning of 2026, CapEx, excluding line extensions as a percentage of revenue, should decline to below 2022 levels and continue to decline thereafter. And we expect 2023 line extension and capital expenditures to reach approximately $4 billion. We continue to expect 2024 and 2025 line extension CapEx to look similar to our outlook for 2023 at approximately $4 billion per year. And our 2024 and 2025 line extension capital expenditure expectations assume that we win funding for or otherwise commit to additional rural spending. As Slide 10 shows, we generated $664 million of consolidated free cash flow this quarter versus $1.8 billion in the first quarter of last year. The decline was primarily driven by higher CapEx mostly driven by our network expansion and network evolution initiatives and an unfavorable change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices, which was typical seasonality for the first quarter but larger than last year. The year-over-year headwind was partly driven by outgoing payments related to the larger inventory buildup in Q4 of 2022 that I just mentioned. For the full year, however, we expect the change in working capital, excluding the impact of mobile devices to be roughly neutral as our capital and payroll accruals should rise over the course of the year. Mobile device working capital will remain a headwind given the mismatch in timing between when we receive EIP payments and when we pay handset providers. Also, in the first quarter, we didn't make significant cash tax payments. And generally speaking, we make four federal cash tax payments a year with two quarterly payments made in the second quarter and one payment made in each of the third and fourth quarters. We're not changing our cash tax outlook that we provided on last quarter's call and simply providing a bit more clarity on the timing of cash tax payments. We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion. As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.47x, and we intend to stay at or just below the high end of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 2.6 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling about $1 billion at an average price of $375 per share. Charter's bandwidth ridge 2-way network passes nearly 56 million homes and businesses with gigabit and converged services everywhere. And given the significant investments we've made in that network over a multiyear period, we're now in a position to upgrade it further in both a cost-efficient and time-efficient manner to offer the fastest speeds and the most advanced telecommunication services in the country. Additionally, our scale and our capabilities are allowing us to rapidly expand that network, both to unserved and underserved areas through our rural construction initiative and to other high ROI expansion opportunities. Those initiatives, combined with our service-oriented operating strategy and prudent capital allocation, are poised to drive long-term customer growth, higher free cash flow and shareholder value. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A. Yes. I mean, Doug, we understand that there is some false market chatter. We should be clear on some other things. The majority of our gross adds are coming from paying lines. Less than 5% of our lines today are tablets, and those have the same rate plans as phones, and we don't include wearables in our numbers either. So the lines that we're putting up are good lines. Yes. To your question on margin and what happens in the second half of the year, the increases that you see both in sales and marketing expense and cost to serve right now and the year-over-year are really driven by strong mobile sales. But if you think about what happens to them for the rest of the year, in sales and marketing, if you look back at last year, 2Q \u201822 sales and marketing expense was sequentially lower than 1Q, which might put a little bit of pressure on the year-over-year comp in Q2. But the year-over-year growth rate of sales and marketing expense should moderate over the course of the second half of the year. We will have lapped our midyear 2022 staffing adjustments. And in Q4, we will lap the Spectrum One-related sales cost increase. Similarly, on the cost reserve side, I expect year-over-year growth in cost to serve to moderate in the second half of 2023, which I think is consistent with what we said before and end the year at growth levels that are more consistent with where we were \u2013 with where we've been previously, which is largely flat. So I do think that as we go through the year to \u2013 in line with what we've said, the business continues to become more efficient, and we continue to expect to be able to operate it more efficiently and generate and generate growth from them. Thanks, Doug. The way it's being reported in the new trending schedule details. So you're getting those passings in sort of \u2013 in the reporting as the 6-month clock starts. Yes. So Phil, talking about going into Q2. Q2 is always a seasonally more difficult quarter. But in terms of trends, we did continue to see what I sort of had said in \u2013 at the end of February, and that I think that our trends looked a little better across coming in and in March than they had in February, which was better than January. And we continue to see that now with the context of Q2 being kind of what it is. So I think that we continue to think that the things look pretty good or at least better than it was previously on that front. Yes. And as we get closer to the rollout, we will try to provide some additional information on where we think that, that will land. The thing that I would add to that is that, Jonathan, we have a very disciplined sort of practice now and how we bid for these offerings. And so we are very comfortable with our ability to price the passings with our ability to then bid for an appropriate amount of subsidy against that and then to go on the back end and execute against building the passings in a way that's cost-effective and that generates the returns that we set out for. So, there is a hypothetical math exercise that you can do to try to get to what we would win. But what I would be clear about is what we win we will win at good returns, and we will execute it on the back end and bring those returns back into the company. Yes. So Craig, I think back in December, we actually gave where we are in terms of margin in the business exclude \u2013 income in the business, excluding customer acquisition costs. And we showed there that if we run it as a \u2013 if we ran it as a standalone business which we don't but that we would make good margins in the business. We certainly have work that you have been doing trying to use some of the financial information available out there to back into costs. Obviously, I am not going to comment on exactly what those were, but you might have heard from us if we thought that you were materially incorrect on them \u2013 or from someone else for that matter. It's important, though, to step back and think about, we don't run the wireless business just for margin in the wireless business. We run our entire business to generate the most cash flow on \u2013 the most cash flow per passing that we can across the network. And that means that you have to have more customers, which means you have to price at a value, and it means that you have to generate more money per customer, and we believe in doing that by adding services to the customer, which we do by adding wireless to our current broadband, video and voice customer base. And we also are seeing that there is benefits to having those products bundled together, not just in the form of driving better pricing for our customers, which we will do, but in the form of reducing churn and ultimately, we think also increasing what we can do in terms of customer acquisition across both the broadband and the wireless product as they become sort of a converged connectivity experience. So, we are really confident in our ability to continue to have a financial benefit from the wireless business going forward because of the value that it adds to what we can provide to the customer and the resulting increased cash flow that we get on a customer-by-customer basis when those customers take more products from us, including the wireless product. On the longer term question on mobile pricing and sort of where we go there, I think the most important thing to \u2013 for us to worry about right now is that we are trying to take share in that market and to take share. We are priced to take share. And while we are doing that, we are still able to make good margins on that product. And so I don't think that there is some sort of long-term pricing game to think about right now. Our \u2013 what we are really thinking about is what we do to take share in the market to provide mobile service to more of our customers, the fastest and best priced in the industry, and to use that to generate cash flow for the business. Thanks."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, and we encourage you to read them carefully.

Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO; and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Chris.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. We had a busy quarter, executing our operating strategy and building on the foundational investments of the past couple of years. We're also successfully managing the transition of customers previously on the government's Affordable Connectivity Program in a period of new competition. And while we expect some normalization of external factors as we head into 2025 and much lower capital intensity beyond 2025, we're not standing still, evidenced by the series of announcements we made in September, a market leading customer service commitment, new pricing and packaging that makes better use of our unique assets in the marketplace, encapsulated in a brand refresh through Spectrum's Life Unlimited promise. There was a lot of flattering press about the importance of wireline networks and convergence this past quarter. We remain the only true convergence pure planner footprint with a fully distributed gig capable wireline and wireless network across a growing 58 million passings everywhere we operate, soon to be symmetrical and multi-gig in all of our communities. Our seamless connectivity capabilities are evidenced by our continued market leading mobile growth. And in just over a year, we completed a full cycle of programming renewals and the launch of Xumo to fundamentally reposition video again as an important part of the connectivity bundle, whether full value hybrid DTC linear packages, smaller non-sports streaming packages or the addition of a la carte programmer apps to our broadband and video customers. We're well positioned to provide seamless connectivity and this new form of seamless entertainment to customers wherever they want to go. Before discussing the quarter, I want to express our sympathy and commitment to the communities across the Southeast impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton. These were devastating storms. The initial impact was significant, mostly because of power outages, downed poles and trees and drops. All but approximately 10,000 of our customers, including homes and businesses fully lost, have had their service restored. In particular, we're still very active in the Asheville, North Carolina area and some remaining pockets at Tampa Bay. I'd like to keep I'd like to thank our frontline personnel for their dedication and effort in keeping our customers connected. That includes our employees who live in the area and were directly impacted themselves and the teams of employees from across the country who volunteered to help in the restoration. During the third quarter, we lost 110,000 internet customers. We added 545,000 Spectrum mobile lines and over 2.1 million lines year-over-year. Revenue grew by 1.6% in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.6%. Were it not for the impact at the end of the ACP program in June, we would have grown our internet customers during the third quarter. Importantly, we've been successful in keeping low income households connected. We continue to compete well against both wireline overbuild and cell phone internet, each with expanded footprints. And we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower and similarly bundled with mobile. We expect market activity and selling opportunities to pick up over time. The cell phone companies will face challenges as customer bandwidth demands continue to grow. As I mentioned, in the meantime, we're not standing still. In mid-September, we made a series of important announcements, including the brand relaunch, a unique customer service commitment and the new pricing and packaging structure. Our strategy has not changed. We offer high quality products to customers in a package and at a price point that our customers can't replicate. We pair that with unmatched customer service. Our fully deployed high bandwidth network with ubiquitous and seamless connectivity and entertainment products creates opportunities and removes barriers to help customers in every aspect of their lives, which led us to our new brand platform, Life Unlimited. While part of that is a new look and feel for the Spectrum brand, it's also about our increasingly converged set of products and building more trust with our customers. Our new customer commitment is comprised of four key promises: Reliable connectivity we're committed to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time and promptly resolving any issues. Transparency at every step We're committed to clear and simple pricing and timely service updates and we will take responsibility when things go wrong. Exceptional service. We're committed to providing exceptional customer experiences. And finally, always improving, meaning we act on our customer's feedback to improve our products and customer service. We back up those commitments with guarantees. For example, to fix any service disruptions quickly, we commit to dispatch a technician the same day if the customer requested prior to 5 PM. If a customer needs help on a professional installation, a technician will be available the same or next day. We now back those commitments with proactive service credits if we miss the mark. We also don't have residential or SMB contracts. And if a customer is not completely satisfied with any services within the first 30 days, we give them their money back. We're making these commitments because we can, because we already made the investments in a 100% US based sales and service with our own employees in frontline tenure through pay, progression, market leading benefits, and tools and systems to make the job better for the employee and our customers. Our Life Unlimited brand relaunch also includes new pricing and packaging that better utilizes our unique product assets, which work better together to provide lower promotional pricing and lower persistent bundle pricing. Our new pricing and packaging will drive more sales with higher selling of our best products, grow customer ARPU at Connect despite lower product pricing, and reduce billing, service and retention calls, while reducing churn. For example, we now offer our gig internet product at $40 per month when bundled with two unlimited mobile lines and or video. Customers that take the new double play will receive a two year price lock, and customers that take our new triple play will receive a three year price lock. And in that package, customers also get our top mobile tier, Xumo and Cloud DVR at no additional charge. For customers who want our popular Spectrum One offering, that remains available. Now with a higher starting speed of 500 megabits per second with one free unlimited mobile line included for a year. Existing customers can also opt into our new bundles at persistent bundled pricing. And we have also increased internet speeds for existing flagship and ultra-customers. It's still very early, but so far, our new pricing and packaging is showing promising results, including more video sell-in, more mobile lines per sale and more gig sell-in. I expect those results and broadband sales to accelerate the seasoning of our marketing and sales approach over time. Our operating strategy remains simple, sell more products to more customers, driving higher penetration against our large fixed asset, reducing the operating capital cost per product with lower churn to ultimately drive more cash flow capacity. And we're making investments in that large fixed asset through our network evolution initiative, which brings multi-gigabit speeds to 100% of our customers. We've launched symmetrical internet service in our step one markets, including Reno, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Dallas Fort Worth, Louisville, Lexington, Rochester, Minnesota, and Rochester, New York. We're now broadly marketing our symmetrical speeds in seven of these eight markets. The high split upgrade process should be largely complete in all of our step one markets by the end of this year. We're making progress on Step 2 DAA and Remote PHY markets and we've deliberately slowed these markets to get the software fully certified to our specs. That has pushed back equipment purchasing and operational deployment and we now expect our network evolution initiative project to be completed in 2027. Excluding the benefit of future capital and operating cost savings, our network evolution has and will cost a very low incremental $100 per passing. We have full visibility to that outcome. We'll update our multiyear capital expenditures outlook, including the new phasing of our network evolution spend when we report our fourth quarter results in January. In Video, over the past year, we transformed all of our major programming agreements in a way that works for our customers and for Charter, including a recent early renewal of Warner Bros. Discovery and then NBCU. These agreements give customers greater overall package flexibility and the ability to include all the key streaming apps from programmers within our Spectrum TV Select packages. That enables us to offer what we now call seamless entertainment, the first for the industry at no extra cost. We also have passed for customers to upgrade to the ad free version of these apps and we will sell programmer apps a la carte to broadband and skinny package video customers. We also had the renewed support from our programming partners to get behind each other's products and distribution for a healthier video ecosystem and better choice and value for customers. More to come on this, but the inclusion of Max with its HBO content and TV Select and how we plan to promote Max to our broadband customers and vice versa will show how we and the programmers more broadly can support one another with our customers front and center. By early 2025, we'll be providing our TV Select customers up to $80 per month of retail streaming app value at no additional cost, including the ad supported versions of Max, Disney+, Peacock Premium, Paramount+, ESPN+, AMC+, Discovery+, BET+ and ViX. Seamless Entertainment, even easier with Xumo, which proves unified search and discovery with a market leading voice remote and the highest rated pay TV streaming app in the US. Over the last couple of years, we've moved away from bundling video in our offers because the value proposition to customers had fallen. We still have some work to do to operationalize the new customer proposition, including the customer front end for programmer app authentication and programmer credentials, but we're proud of what we can offer customers, existing and new in terms of value and utility. And that breakthrough is why we are including video in the new bundles we launched in September. Fundamentally, we believe that maintaining and evolving the video business, even if it isn't growing, helps customer acquisition and retention by making use of our scale and capabilities and adding more value into our unique seamless connectivity relationship. Video still has positive cash flow and provides us with option value. So a lot of exciting things happened in the third quarter. Our continued success in mobile is certainly one of those. Our mobile offering continues to evolve, driving strong results and supporting our new pricing and packaging efforts. We had our highest port ends quarter ever. Our highest mix of ads on unlimited plus driving higher customer value and ARPU. And our lines per customer continues to grow nicely. Today, approximately 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. So we remain under penetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market leading pricing at promotion and retail. As we work through the one-time impacts of ACP this year, new competition with expanded footprint and our unique non-recurring subsidized network expansion investment, we remain confident in our ability to drive healthy, long-term connectivity customer growth. Now in the future, we have the best fully deployed network uniquely capable of delivering seamless connectivity or convergence everywhere we operate, with pricing and packaging that saves customers money with the best products, and a service capability investment that has yet to be fully realized as a competitive advantage. Our team is executing well on these multiyear initiatives, a team that's hungry with a tremendous drive to win for our customers, the communities we serve, our fellow employees, and for our shareholders. Jessica?\nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to mention that today's results do not include any impact related to hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit the Southeast in late-September and early-October. Our fourth quarter results will include some lost customers and passings related to the storm from both suppressed gross additions and the damaged or destroyed plant that Chris mentioned. We're still assessing the impacted areas and we expect to rebuild lost passings over time as our customers rebuild. We currently expect to incur approximately $100 million in incremental capital expenditures, the vast majority of which will be captured in our rebuild capital expenditures line. We have been providing bill credits to customers in impacted areas and those onetime credits will offset some fourth quarter revenue. We may also have some incremental operating expense, although we expect that to be relatively small. And we'll isolate the storm impacts when we report our fourth quarter results. Let's please turn to our customer results on Slide 8. Including residential and SMB, we lost a 110,000 internet customers in the third quarter, while in mobile, we added 545,000 lines. Video customers declined by 294,000 and wireline voice customers declined by 288,000. The end of the ACP program drove higher third quarter non-pay and voluntary churn among former ACP customers for a total estimated third quarter impact of approximately 200,000 internet losses. Incremental non-pay disconnects drove more than half of those losses and the rest of the impact was primarily driven by voluntary churn with a small impact from lower connects. We continued to do a very good job in managing the end of the program and we've retained the vast majority of our customers who were previously receiving an ACP benefit. Beyond ACP, we competed well across our footprint, but note that our third quarter internet net additions benefited from seasonal back-to-school connects and a work stoppage at one of our competitors, while fourth quarter customer results will include impacts from the storms up and about 100,000 incremental non-pay disconnects and some lagging voluntary disconnects, both related to the end of ACP. After those effects in the fourth quarter, we expect the onetime impacts from ACP to be behind us. Turning to rural. We ended the quarter with 696,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by a 114,000 in the third quarter and by 381,000 over the last 12 months. And we had 41,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We now expect to activate close to 400,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024. About 35% more than in 2023, but lower than our original 2024 plan of 450,000 due to shifting construction labor to rebuild activity in storm impacted markets. We expect our subsidized Rural Construction activity to recover by the end of the fourth quarter and that reacceleration of activity to put us on a higher pace in 2025 as planned. Our RDOF build should still be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to third quarter revenue on Slide 9. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 1.8%, while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.8% year-over-year given promotional rate step ups, rate adjustments, the growth of Spectrum Mobile and $63 million of residential customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. These factors were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower priced video packages within our base and $25 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps, which are netted within video revenue. As Slide 9 shows, in total, residential revenue grew by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial, total commercial revenue grew by 2% year-over-year with SMB revenue growth of 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustments. Enterprise revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.7 percent year-over-year. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.9%. Third quarter advertising revenue grew by 18% year over year given political revenue growth. Excluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 6.3% year over year due to higher levels of inventory in the market, partly offset by higher advanced advertising revenue. Other revenue grew by 11.6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 1.6% year-over-year, which is 0.6% year-over-year when excluding advertising revenue and $68 million of customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. In the third quarter, total operating expenses grew by 0.2% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 10% year-over-year due to a 9.5% decline in video customers year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, and costs allocated to programmer streaming apps, which are now netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates and a $61 million benefit in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. Other costs of revenue increased by 15.8%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher mobile service direct costs. Cost-to-service customers declined 0.5% year-over-year given productivity from our 10-year investments, including lower labor costs, partly offset by modest year-over-year growth in bad debt expense. Sales and marketing costs grew by 4.4% as we remained focused on driving customer acquisition and given our Life Unlimited brand relaunch in September. Finally, other expense grew by 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.6% year-over-year in the quarter. And when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.7% year-over-year. Turning to net income. We generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, in line with last year, as higher adjusted EBITDA was mostly offset by higher other expenses, primarily due to noncash changes in the value of financial instruments. Turning to Slide 11. Capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion in the third quarter, down about $400 million from last year's third quarter. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, $16 million higher than last year driven by our subsidized Rural Construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market billing opportunities. Third quarter capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $1.5 billion, which was lower than the prior year period by about $400 million. The decline was driven by core CapEx items, including CPE timing and lower than originally expected spend on network evolution given what Chris discussed earlier with respect to our Step 2 software certification. We now expect total 2024 capital expenditures to reach approximately $11.5 billion, down from approximately $12 billion previously. That update reflects full year 2024 line extension spend of approximately $4.3 billion, down from $4.5 billion, partly offset by slightly higher core CapEx, primarily due to the shift of some of our construction labor from rural efforts to hurricane rebuild activity. The update also includes 2024 network evolution estimated spend of approximately $1.1 billion, down from the previous estimate of $1.6 billion. Much of that originally planned 2024 spend is being pushed into 2026 and 2027. As Chris mentioned, we will update our multiyear capital expenditures outlook when we complete our 2025 operating plan and report our fourth quarter results in January. We now expect our total BEAD spend will be substantially less than our spend in RDOF, in each case, net of subsidies. That lower outlook reflects the most recent broadband map updates in terms of available unserved passings near our network and a little less favorable rules framework in BEAD when compared to RDOF and state grants. We have been in regular communication with the states in which we operate and we are generally the largest rural builder in our states through RDOF, ARPA and other grants. While we're still finishing the 2025 operating plan, it's clear 2025 capital expenditures will not exceed the range of capital spend that we outlined in January of this year, even inclusive of a small amount of initial BEAD pending. Looking beyond 2025, we expect total capital spending in dollar terms to be on a meaningful downward trajectory, even inclusive of BEAD spending. So total capital intensity is now poised to decline significantly after 2025 even including the unique onetime opportunity that subsidized rural spend and network evolution has presented us. While we always prioritize our cash flow for organic opportunities first and then accretive M&A and buybacks, there are no organic capital expenditure opportunities on the horizon that give us concern with that capital intensity outlook. Free cash flow in the third quarter totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $520 million compared to last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower CapEx. We finished the quarter with $95.1 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.0 billion. We repurchased just under 850,000 Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $260 million at an average price of $311 per share, less than we had originally expected as we became restricted as a result of our negotiations with Liberty Broadband. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.22 times. We remain committed to our levered equity strategy and to share repurchases as a component of that strategy. Our leverage ratio may decline further given our pause and buybacks, but we look forward to resuming our program when we are able and we have not changed our target leverage. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kutgun Maral from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Just one on broadband. Net adds in the quarter were very encouraging with a return to a quite meaningful sub growth, excluding ACP. Is there any color you can provide on the competitive backdrop and perhaps any early reads on the underlying broadband trends in the fourth quarter, excluding the incremental ACP net losses you called out? Thank you.\nChristopher Winfrey: Sure. A very much anticipated question. So maybe I tried to talk about the market more generally, both inside of the third quarter. What we're -- what we think about the fourth quarter and where that does or doesn't position us for next year. But I think as you mentioned, there's a lot of puts and takes inside the third quarter. Underlying all that is that we are competing very well in a marketplace that still has lots of competition, lots of new competition with expanded footprint. In the third quarter, we did have some benefits that are unique to the third quarter, seasonality, which is typical. We also had a some, not large, but some impact from -- positive impact from a competitor who had a work stoppage. I think that's well understood. And then we had obviously the downside of significant ACP primarily through nonpay disconnects and voluntary churn, but we're managing that well. And in the fourth quarter, when you think about the seasonality and the work stoppage benefits, we won't have those inside the fourth quarter. We'll still have approximately 100,000 nonpay to deal with from ACP that we expect to see early in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. And we also have some hurricane impacts. And so that will impact subscribers, credits, as well as, Jessica mentioned, some capital and rebuild. And so then I think the bigger question is, as you look out, where does that leave us? We're not about managing for short-term for quarters. We're really about thinking about the long-term for the business. In 2025, there won't be ACP and we'll still have the continued tailwind of newly built passings, both organic as well as rural footprint. And then I think there's just the big questions or variables that will exist. Is lower interest rate environment, does that impact mortgages in a way that drives higher move rates? Have we seen the peak cell phone Internet impact? And it appears that that's the case. And can we drive even higher Internet sales as well as all of the additional bundling and higher product value packaging that I described through our new pricing and packaging, and really even more so than today, start to fully realize the benefits of mobile, not just through churn, but through additional Internet acquisition rates. And then finally, really a bogey variable, one that we wouldn't bet on, but I think is out there in terms of option values, can video, a reconstituted video, can that really provide broadband acquisition and retention support? So that's probably much longer to look towards the tail end of next year and beyond. But I think we're making the right investments and doing the right things to compete. We are still very much in an atypical low churn environment when you exclude ACP. And despite that, it's still a competitive environment for new sales. So I think if you step back, it's too early to declare victory or even plateau, but certainly a better unit growth setup for 2024 for 2025 than what we saw for 2024, I think, for us and probably for the rest of the cable industry.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Kutgun. Operator, we'll take our next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Can you hear me?\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Great. Hey, Chris. Chris, as we look beyond cell phone Internet to Fiber, not that fiber is new, but as we think about the footprint expansion within Charter's footprint, can you talk a little bit about where that sits today, your sort of gig markets, where you see that going over the next, I don't know, three plus years? And kind of how you think your market share shakes out as you analyze your historical performance in fiber markets and think about sort of what's happening in the marketplace and all the things you're doing at Charter to compete. And I don't know if you'll be able to answer this, but could you talk about why the Liberty Broadband opportunity is interesting to Charter? And if you do come to an agreement, are you able to buy back stock pre-close? Is there a way to put a mechanism in place to get back in the market or does that have to close before you're able to get back in? Thank you so much.\nChristopher Winfrey: Sure. Let me start with the easy one, which is the last question you asked about Liberty Broadband. We've said what we can say for the time being through Liberty's 8-K and what there is very much public. I think we're going to have to stay quiet until there's something more to talk about in the meantime, at which point, of course, we'll talk through everything that you just asked. I know those are important questions. So unfortunately just going to have to deflect those for the time being. But if you step back to gig overlap, which includes all types of gig overlap in our footprint, it's roughly 55% today. And where it goes, I think, depends on people's access to capital, what happens in the M&A environment. But also, I think there are, as widely understood as I think there's probably some competing notions of that overlap footprint and where it may not be mutually exclusive. And as a result, I think people with the combination of scale back investment plans, plus recognizing that they're not going to be the X competitor that they thought they were going to be, may need or want to back off just because they're not going to be able to make returns. I've always thought that a wireline overbuild has very poor, if not negative, returns. And so when you start to have duplicative plans of multiple overbuilders, it really just makes it that much worse. It's actually terrible. So I think there is a realization that, that will take place. And so where it goes depends on somewhat the rational nature of our competitors and where they want to deploy capital. In the meantime, what can we do around that is we can continue to make the type of investments that we're making today is make sure that we have a symmetrical multi-gig wireline network across our entire footprint, have a seamless connectivity product through convergence that none of our competitors can ubiquitously use to compete. And then add to that the ability to save customers significant amounts of money, obviously, with mobile, where we offer tremendous advantage given our structure. But also in some of these rural footprints, as strange as that may sound, we offer customers the ability to save significant amounts of money with their wireline phone relative to what they pay. No. That's not in vogue to talk about, but the reality is something I think we could use specifically in that market to drive even faster penetration in the rural footprint. So overall, in our existing, inside of our new footprint, I think we have a great set of assets, a better and faster set of products, higher quality service because we're 100% onshore here in the US with sales and service, primarily with our own employees who are committed to that high-quality service. Then who knows, over time, the ability to add a unique video package that appeals to customers of all budget levels in terms of what they can afford and to deliver great value and utility inside the video package, I think, remains a big potential upside in terms of our ability to drive broadband and to compete against some of these competitors who don't have the same network seamless connectivity, packaging and product set and the ability to save customers money. I think we've got the best hand as it relates to our ability to compete in these marketplaces. What we typically see with any new overbuild, and that's not new, that's -- we have a lot of experience with this, it's been going on for probably 15 years, as you see an initial uptake, it can put a few points of penetration impact at the outset when somebody comes in for the first 18, 24 months and then the market kind of settles out. And so when we look to historical wireline overbuilders, many of which never got to the stated penetrations that today people say are required for return and that includes DSL conversion. I feel pretty good about where we can go over time, how we can compete. And the fact that at some point, the reality will be there that there's not a great financial return for wireline overbuilds when it's a single, much less if it's a multiple.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks so much, Chris.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chaplin: Morning, guys. First, I'd like to just touch on the brand repositioning. From our perspective, I think, it's a pretty profound change in the strategy and would love to get some context for I mean it's probably too early, but are you starting to see any impact on gross adds or churn? Yes. And when do you think -- how long does it -- do you think it sort of takes to really start to be felt in the business? And then from the bill credits that come with the commitments that you're making, would we be expecting any impact on ARPU and costs from those or have you gotten your internal systems to the point where you're happy to give the bill credits because you know you're not going to have to give any?\nChristopher Winfrey: Sure. It's a lot in that. Okay. I appreciate that you appreciate that the brand repositioning and the commitments that we're making are significant. I think it's really exciting for us and where we can go. It really comes about because we had made the significant investment in our own employees and investing in frontline tenure, which is progression and the ability for our employees to not just think about it as a job, but to have it as a career. And that gives us a higher quality craft than what you could have with contractors or offshore personnel. But at the same time, we really had not gotten the credit, I think, in the marketplace from customer satisfaction or NPS the way that we thought that reflected the investment that we've made. And so some of that comes down to doing a better job as a management team and avoiding some of the paper cuts that exist in customer service. The quality of service is there, the investment is there. This isn't a money issue. This is really trying to just, around the edges, how can you do better? That's one. Two is making sure that we had implemented some of the softer touch for customer service and to just give customers more recognition for their tenure with us and to remind them that we're local inside of their communities, and that these are committed employees to the company. And three is to really stand behind our service and back it up with guarantees, guarantees for service, and guarantees about what happens if we're honest when we fail to meet that service level that we've committed to customers and to stand behind that. And so most of that, which goes to your bill credit question, isn't going to be giving out bill credits. It's going to be reminding customers that that's the type of quality of service that they can expect from Charter from Spectrum. And to the extent that we miss, we're going to proactively apply credit and own it and apologize for where we don't get it right and to do a better job. I don't think the bill credits, there will be some incremental impact. I don't think it's going to be particularly material as it relates to ARPU. But what it does is it puts a pretty significant flashlight on us internally to make sure that what are those paper cuts, where are those service misses, and it provides a real incentive internally for us to go manage that down by providing even better and high quality of service. So a lot of this is just making sure that we get recognized for the investments that we've already made, but a lot of it also is forcing ourselves to be better and to do better. And then you match that service commitment at the same time with some of the ethos that was in what I described, which is around billing transparency and having high-quality services and products, which we do have, but even simple things about rounding the pricing, instead of $0.99, to rounding it to even dollars, and to having lower promotional pricing when bundled and lower persistent pricing when bundled in a way that not only saves customers money now, and we always did over time, but even more money over time to the extent they take more product from us. It's customer-friendly and competitive in the marketplace. So I'm really excited about it. There is, it is way, way too early, your question about any early impact of that. I think it's less about what you say and it's more about what you do and that takes time to be recognized in the marketplace. And so I think this is something that, maybe if we're lucky, back end of next year from just the customer commitments and service aspect, we could see the benefit of that. This is a multiyear process. It's not something that we're looking to immediately. But I think the good news, as you've highlighted, is we're very, very focused on our reputation in the marketplace, which impacts both customer acquisition as well as retention and the customer life, which has a better financial outcome for our shareholders as well as well as just being a great operator in the local communities we serve.\nJessica Fischer: Maybe the one early item that I think is really clear that's worth pointing out though is that the bundled strategy in what was rolled out in the new pricing and packaging is being really successful in doing the things that we hoped that it would do, which collectively should drive higher customer ARPU in terms of getting customers to take higher tiered packages, getting customers to take more products inside of those packages, and also sort of expanding the number of mobile lines that we're seeing sort of taken per customer. So the one piece, I think, that's been easy to see upfront is that, that strategy around sort of pushing value back into the bundle and utilizing that to drive higher customer ARPUs, I do think will be quite effective.\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes. It's the old strategy that you can lower your product pricing and have higher customer ARPU, both at the time of sale as well as over time, and have longer customer lives and have lower operating costs and, therefore, have better returns by doing the right thing.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Jonathan. Operator, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. I'm going to try to squeeze in two if I can. First, this is an interesting question that we've been pondering a bit, that you've been building out FTTH networks yourselves in your edge out and expansion areas. How much of your plant today is FTTH rather than HFC? And what kind of differences do you notice competitively in places, I know a lot of those are noncompetitive markets, but what kind of differences do you see competitively when you do have fiber to compete with rather than relying on your HFC network? And then if I could squeeze in one extra. Chris, you talked about lower participation in the BEAD program. Does that open the door perhaps to say if you can't expand your footprint through subsidized building, there may be opportunities for small-scale M&A, sort of rural cable operators, for example, that might be attractive and could be acquired for less than the cost of building yourself in a lot of cases?\nChristopher Winfrey: Sure. On the Fiber-to-the-Home expansion, I don't have that number in front of me. I know when we started our rural build, we had roughly 750,000 passings or 750,000 miles planned. I think we're well over 900,000 today. If you think about how that's evolved over time, at the time we were 750,000 miles planned, we were about 50-50 in terms of construction that was between HFC and FTTH and we're now at close to 90% of the new build that we do is Fiber-to-the-Home. We do that simply because, on the increment, it's fine to do. The reality is what we see from a competitive standpoint as well as from a service standpoint, we see absolutely no difference. In fact, in our Fiber-to-the-Home footprint, oddly enough, we have a slightly higher troubled call rate than we do inside of our HFC plant on a 10-year adjusted basis for customers and plant construction. So I think that will normalize over time. Some of that's more software-driven related to OLTs and whatnot. But my big point there is zero difference to us in terms of the service quality or what we see really in competitiveness between the FTTH plant where we operate with HFC. The HFC over time is going to have certain advantages relative to fiber. And I would start by saying that, remember that, of our HFC plant, I don't know the exact stat, but whether it's 99.5% or 99.8% of our HFC plant really is fiber. And it's really at the end that it's coax on the run, which often is the case with Fiber-to-the-Home, in home wiring as well. So we're essentially the same network, except at the end, we have the advantage of having the ability to have more telemetry because of power and the ability to hang small cells from a wireless strategy perspective in a very capillary way. So we're spending time on really thinking through, over time, is the HFC network actually superior as a result of some of the capabilities that it will lend. I'm not there making that claim today, but I think there are some real advantages to the plant. And today, there's really no difference for us from what we see between one and the other. Do you want to jump in on?\nJessica Fischer: Yes. On the lower BEAD participation and what we would do then in small-scale M&A. Craig, we always say we like cable businesses, we believe we operate them well. When there are small-scale opportunities that fit well with our footprint, we will often, go after those. They're typically so small that you sort of don't see them and how they fold in. But I think that we look at those opportunities the way that we look at any other opportunity and expanding our footprint in that way does make sense when it's at the right price. I don't necessarily foresee that there's a trade-off as between BEAD and doing small-scale M&A. I think we pursue both of those opportunities where they make sense and will drive returns for the company.\nChristopher Winfrey: I agree.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Craig. Operator, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thanks. And two sort of related questions. One, actually, Jessica, you may have -- you sort of touched on. I was just wondering, are there any sort of margin implications for the new pricing and packaging? It sounds like you're going to -- you expect to have better sell-in, which should lead to better margins. But sort of any -- when should we expect to see the sort of benefits of that, both in terms of margins and maybe changes in subscriber trends on the data side and video side? And then, obviously, you've seen some nice EBITDA acceleration through the year, probably will again in the fourth quarter with political advertising. Can you sort of point out any puts or takes as we try to get a sense for what EBITDA trends look like in 2025? Obviously, you don't want to give guidance now. But is there anything you can point to or that suggests the momentum you've seen through the year will continue in '25? Thanks.\nJessica Fischer: Yes. So starting on the margin implications for the new pricing and packaging. What we think about when we look at the success of the program is what Chris was describing in terms of how do you drive the most product value to the consumer that generates the most revenue. And then really, I guess, I think of it as sort of the most cash flow per customer, which isn't margin as a percentage. It's margin as an absolute dollar value. And in that case, I think that we're quite confident that the new pricing and packaging will be really successful in driving additional cash flow per customer because of the value that we've pushed into the bundles and what that means for the total margin that we can generate on the services offered to those customers. Does that mean that margin as a percentage will go up? That one is less clear. I actually think that the video product is a bit more attractive in the new pricing and packaging as we pull it together. And so because of that, your mix around how much video versus how much mobile and how much Internet might change. Mix tends to drive margin percentage across the company. And in this case, it might get you to the wrong answer because I think that we can drive the most collective margin by driving the most products to the customer. On the EBITDA front, thinking about the fourth quarter and next year, we still anticipate strong EBITDA growth in Q4, though it might not accelerate the way that we had hoped given that some of our expense reduction impacts, I think, came in a little earlier than we expected and we will have the storm impacts that hit inside of Q4. Still strong, but maybe not accelerating. And then going into next year, we're, of course, going to target EBITDA growth. But there are some meaningful headwinds, which I think include our Internet customer losses in 2024 and a nonpolitical year for advertising. Even with that, our expense reduction efforts, which I've mentioned before, include things that are both short-term and have already rolled in as well as some medium and longer-term items that are still building. I think that they'll put us in a good place. But there are meaningful headwinds as we go into next year.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thanks, Jessica.\nChristopher Winfrey: John, on the first question, Jessica is right about we focus on cash flow margin. But even with the percent over time, so I'm not talking at acquisition, but over time, I think it's important to note that our triple play bundles of different combinations. They have the highest dollars of EBITDA -- not only the highest ARPU, but the highest dollars of EBITDA contribution. They also have the lowest churn and the longest customer life and they have the best ROI. And that still is the case today, which comes back to our launch of the new Spectrum pricing and packaging is you just have to make sure that there's real value in the products that you're putting on the bill. And if there is, and it's a high-quality product, there's value and you have utility all packaged together, you can be in an environment where you have higher dollars of ARPU. You have higher dollars of margin. You have lower churn and lower operating cost per PSU. And even as a result of having a mix with products with different direct costs in there, you can end up long-term with higher EBITDA margin even as a percent also because your operating cost is much lower. Your churn is lower. And as a result, your subscriber acquisition cost is lower because you're not having to replace customers that you lost with new ones to fill the hole. And instead you're using your subscriber acquisition cost to acquire net new customers, which has the impact of increasing your dollar margin as well as your percent margin over the long-term. And that's the unique competitive advantage, I think, that we have is we have all those products, seamless connectivity and seamless entertainment in 100% of our footprint. And that's what we're trying to do is make better use of those capabilities.\nJohn Hodulik: Got it. Thank you.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, John. Thank you. Operator, we'll take our next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Steven Cahall from Wells Fargo.\nSteven Cahall: Thank you. Can you hear me okay?\nChristopher Winfrey: Yes.\nSteven Cahall: So Chris, you have a unique video offering at this point. And I know you've worked hard to add the streaming services to customers. When we think about where you can go from here, I'm not sure there's been an uptick kind of year-on-year in double and triple play customers yet. It sounds like you're thinking maybe later next year is when you might see the fruition of a lot of those efforts come together in those multiproduct customers. So I was just wondering how you could add a little more color to retention and acquisition and what the timing and the impact of that looks like at the customer level over the medium-term. And then just a small one. I know it's tough to unpack ARPU. But if we just think about roll to pay, you were very aggressive on Spectrum One about 18 months ago. Can you help us at all think about how much roll to pay is contributing to either revenue or ARPU at this point? Thank you.\nChristopher Winfrey: Why don't I take the first one, and Jessica, if you have thoughts on the second? I agree, we have a unique video offering and, at the same time, it's easy to get impatient as to how quickly we can get all that fully rolled out in a way that's easy for customers to understand, appreciate, sign up to, and utilize. And yet, when you think about that first half of 2025 that I talked about to fully operationalize it, it's really, that would only be 18 months from the time we first started to enter into these programming agreements. And so it's a relatively short period of time when we're going to be fully operationalized. So our goals, our priorities here was first to really focus on getting all these programming agreements done in a, I think, what turned out to be a 12 or 13 month period. So pretty quick to really run through all of those program agreements, some of which were early renewals because programmers were getting behind us. The second piece is to just physically get launched the programmer apps to form part of our seamless entertainment so that customers can subscribe to those. It's not the same because they have a broader direct-to-consumer businesses and we need to work with them on authentication as well as programmer specific credentials, which means that, in its current state, it's a high-value proposition, but it's not always easy to find and it's not always easy to subscribe and to manage your existing subscriptions potentially with those programmer apps. And so that's the environment that we sit today, which is good takeup, but not exactly the most customer-friendly proposition just yet, which is what we're working through. The second priority or the third priority, first is programming relationships, two was launch the direct-to-consumer app, third is to implement the ability for customers to upgrade to the ad-free version of these apps, only a couple of which has already been launched, so we're well in the progress with that as well. And then the final piece is really to put it all inside of what I would call a video portal, which allows you to manage all of your video subscription with us, including all of the programmer apps, when it's included as part of your offer, when it's upgraded to the ad free version, we have economics as well. And the ability to sell these programmer apps to our broadband customers or to our skinny package video customers, all in the same place where you can manage your subscriptions. And that's a compelling marketplace for video that we're developing today. And it requires for some pretty significant cooperation as well, as you can imagine, with the programmers. And we think we'll have all that placed in the first half of 2025 and be able to present that to customers as part of our pricing and packaging. I think there was some misconception in the marketplace that thought that we were going to do some big, huge marketing campaign and that would have a financial impact next year. That's really not the case. The investment we're making is the utility of finding all of this in a place that can manage your subscriptions and they've been able to activate all of that within Xumo in particular or other platforms. And the marketing and sales that we're doing really is tied to our new pricing and packaging as part of these bundles that we're putting out. So longer term, I expect all of that to have a pretty significant impact on acquisition and retention, certainly for video, but hopefully also with Internet when bundled together. Already without getting to that place that we expect to be next year we already see a significant uplift in the video sell-in just from the way that we're bundling and going to market with this new Spectrum pricing and packaging even without the benefit of that the video marketplace environment that I described. We're already seeing a pretty significant uplift. And the reason that we're comfortable with that is because we know the value is there, because of what's in place already today with some of the programmer apps and what's coming, what will be launched, and the ability to actually find and manage it in a better way. So we're pretty -- look, we're -- on one hand, we're excited about the space because it adds value. On the other hand, I want to be careful we're not forecasting video growth. We're simply saying that it's a way to add utility into our seamless connectivity relationships in a way that hasn't existed. And from our past experience, we know the value that can come about to the overall bundle by doing that right.\nJessica Fischer: I'll take the other one on the mobile called roll-to-pay rates. We still see our free lines converting to being paying customers at very strong rates. In terms of the impact that has on ARPUs across the system, so once you get to, I'm going to say normalized, but once you get to a similar number of overall free lines inside of the system in a year-over-year, then you no longer end up with the same sort of boosts or impact of the year-over-year -- the same year-over-year impact on ARPU. So if I think about Internet ARPU there, as an example, Internet ARPU grew 2.8% on a GAAP basis. It would have been 3.1%, excluding the GAAP allocations, which is a closer tie between the two of those than what we've seen previously. And I think going forward, you'll find those coming together. On the other side, mobile ARPU actually was up and is looking really good. But the increase that you see in mobile ARPU related to the uptake of our Unlimited Plus plans, which really has been driven by anytime upgrade and I think could be driven further given some of the incentives that we have around it in the new pricing and packaging plans. So we're seeing, I guess, good growth in ARPU, but not as much at this point related to the roll-off of free lines in the system, not because the free lines aren't performing well, but just because the free lines now as a portion of the total base are more normalized.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Steven. And that concludes our call today. Operator, we'll pass it back to you.\nChristopher Winfrey: Thank you very much.\nJessica Fischer: Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christopher Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. We had a busy quarter, executing our operating strategy and building on the foundational investments of the past couple of years. We're also successfully managing the transition of customers previously on the government's Affordable Connectivity Program in a period of new competition. And while we expect some normalization of external factors as we head into 2025 and much lower capital intensity beyond 2025, we're not standing still, evidenced by the series of announcements we made in September, a market leading customer service commitment, new pricing and packaging that makes better use of our unique assets in the marketplace, encapsulated in a brand refresh through Spectrum's Life Unlimited promise. There was a lot of flattering press about the importance of wireline networks and convergence this past quarter. We remain the only true convergence pure planner footprint with a fully distributed gig capable wireline and wireless network across a growing 58 million passings everywhere we operate, soon to be symmetrical and multi-gig in all of our communities. Our seamless connectivity capabilities are evidenced by our continued market leading mobile growth. And in just over a year, we completed a full cycle of programming renewals and the launch of Xumo to fundamentally reposition video again as an important part of the connectivity bundle, whether full value hybrid DTC linear packages, smaller non-sports streaming packages or the addition of a la carte programmer apps to our broadband and video customers. We're well positioned to provide seamless connectivity and this new form of seamless entertainment to customers wherever they want to go. Before discussing the quarter, I want to express our sympathy and commitment to the communities across the Southeast impacted by hurricanes Helene and Milton. These were devastating storms. The initial impact was significant, mostly because of power outages, downed poles and trees and drops. All but approximately 10,000 of our customers, including homes and businesses fully lost, have had their service restored. In particular, we're still very active in the Asheville, North Carolina area and some remaining pockets at Tampa Bay. I'd like to keep I'd like to thank our frontline personnel for their dedication and effort in keeping our customers connected. That includes our employees who live in the area and were directly impacted themselves and the teams of employees from across the country who volunteered to help in the restoration. During the third quarter, we lost 110,000 internet customers. We added 545,000 Spectrum mobile lines and over 2.1 million lines year-over-year. Revenue grew by 1.6% in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.6%. Were it not for the impact at the end of the ACP program in June, we would have grown our internet customers during the third quarter. Importantly, we've been successful in keeping low income households connected. We continue to compete well against both wireline overbuild and cell phone internet, each with expanded footprints. And we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower and similarly bundled with mobile. We expect market activity and selling opportunities to pick up over time. The cell phone companies will face challenges as customer bandwidth demands continue to grow. As I mentioned, in the meantime, we're not standing still. In mid-September, we made a series of important announcements, including the brand relaunch, a unique customer service commitment and the new pricing and packaging structure. Our strategy has not changed. We offer high quality products to customers in a package and at a price point that our customers can't replicate. We pair that with unmatched customer service. Our fully deployed high bandwidth network with ubiquitous and seamless connectivity and entertainment products creates opportunities and removes barriers to help customers in every aspect of their lives, which led us to our new brand platform, Life Unlimited. While part of that is a new look and feel for the Spectrum brand, it's also about our increasingly converged set of products and building more trust with our customers. Our new customer commitment is comprised of four key promises: Reliable connectivity we're committed to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time and promptly resolving any issues. Transparency at every step We're committed to clear and simple pricing and timely service updates and we will take responsibility when things go wrong. Exceptional service. We're committed to providing exceptional customer experiences. And finally, always improving, meaning we act on our customer's feedback to improve our products and customer service. We back up those commitments with guarantees. For example, to fix any service disruptions quickly, we commit to dispatch a technician the same day if the customer requested prior to 5 PM. If a customer needs help on a professional installation, a technician will be available the same or next day. We now back those commitments with proactive service credits if we miss the mark. We also don't have residential or SMB contracts. And if a customer is not completely satisfied with any services within the first 30 days, we give them their money back. We're making these commitments because we can, because we already made the investments in a 100% US based sales and service with our own employees in frontline tenure through pay, progression, market leading benefits, and tools and systems to make the job better for the employee and our customers. Our Life Unlimited brand relaunch also includes new pricing and packaging that better utilizes our unique product assets, which work better together to provide lower promotional pricing and lower persistent bundle pricing. Our new pricing and packaging will drive more sales with higher selling of our best products, grow customer ARPU at Connect despite lower product pricing, and reduce billing, service and retention calls, while reducing churn. For example, we now offer our gig internet product at $40 per month when bundled with two unlimited mobile lines and or video. Customers that take the new double play will receive a two year price lock, and customers that take our new triple play will receive a three year price lock. And in that package, customers also get our top mobile tier, Xumo and Cloud DVR at no additional charge. For customers who want our popular Spectrum One offering, that remains available. Now with a higher starting speed of 500 megabits per second with one free unlimited mobile line included for a year. Existing customers can also opt into our new bundles at persistent bundled pricing. And we have also increased internet speeds for existing flagship and ultra-customers. It's still very early, but so far, our new pricing and packaging is showing promising results, including more video sell-in, more mobile lines per sale and more gig sell-in. I expect those results and broadband sales to accelerate the seasoning of our marketing and sales approach over time. Our operating strategy remains simple, sell more products to more customers, driving higher penetration against our large fixed asset, reducing the operating capital cost per product with lower churn to ultimately drive more cash flow capacity. And we're making investments in that large fixed asset through our network evolution initiative, which brings multi-gigabit speeds to 100% of our customers. We've launched symmetrical internet service in our step one markets, including Reno, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Dallas Fort Worth, Louisville, Lexington, Rochester, Minnesota, and Rochester, New York. We're now broadly marketing our symmetrical speeds in seven of these eight markets. The high split upgrade process should be largely complete in all of our step one markets by the end of this year. We're making progress on Step 2 DAA and Remote PHY markets and we've deliberately slowed these markets to get the software fully certified to our specs. That has pushed back equipment purchasing and operational deployment and we now expect our network evolution initiative project to be completed in 2027. Excluding the benefit of future capital and operating cost savings, our network evolution has and will cost a very low incremental $100 per passing. We have full visibility to that outcome. We'll update our multiyear capital expenditures outlook, including the new phasing of our network evolution spend when we report our fourth quarter results in January. In Video, over the past year, we transformed all of our major programming agreements in a way that works for our customers and for Charter, including a recent early renewal of Warner Bros. Discovery and then NBCU. These agreements give customers greater overall package flexibility and the ability to include all the key streaming apps from programmers within our Spectrum TV Select packages. That enables us to offer what we now call seamless entertainment, the first for the industry at no extra cost. We also have passed for customers to upgrade to the ad free version of these apps and we will sell programmer apps a la carte to broadband and skinny package video customers. We also had the renewed support from our programming partners to get behind each other's products and distribution for a healthier video ecosystem and better choice and value for customers. More to come on this, but the inclusion of Max with its HBO content and TV Select and how we plan to promote Max to our broadband customers and vice versa will show how we and the programmers more broadly can support one another with our customers front and center. By early 2025, we'll be providing our TV Select customers up to $80 per month of retail streaming app value at no additional cost, including the ad supported versions of Max, Disney+, Peacock Premium, Paramount+, ESPN+, AMC+, Discovery+, BET+ and ViX. Seamless Entertainment, even easier with Xumo, which proves unified search and discovery with a market leading voice remote and the highest rated pay TV streaming app in the US. Over the last couple of years, we've moved away from bundling video in our offers because the value proposition to customers had fallen. We still have some work to do to operationalize the new customer proposition, including the customer front end for programmer app authentication and programmer credentials, but we're proud of what we can offer customers, existing and new in terms of value and utility. And that breakthrough is why we are including video in the new bundles we launched in September. Fundamentally, we believe that maintaining and evolving the video business, even if it isn't growing, helps customer acquisition and retention by making use of our scale and capabilities and adding more value into our unique seamless connectivity relationship. Video still has positive cash flow and provides us with option value. So a lot of exciting things happened in the third quarter. Our continued success in mobile is certainly one of those. Our mobile offering continues to evolve, driving strong results and supporting our new pricing and packaging efforts. We had our highest port ends quarter ever. Our highest mix of ads on unlimited plus driving higher customer value and ARPU. And our lines per customer continues to grow nicely. Today, approximately 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. So we remain under penetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market leading pricing at promotion and retail. As we work through the one-time impacts of ACP this year, new competition with expanded footprint and our unique non-recurring subsidized network expansion investment, we remain confident in our ability to drive healthy, long-term connectivity customer growth. Now in the future, we have the best fully deployed network uniquely capable of delivering seamless connectivity or convergence everywhere we operate, with pricing and packaging that saves customers money with the best products, and a service capability investment that has yet to be fully realized as a competitive advantage. Our team is executing well on these multiyear initiatives, a team that's hungry with a tremendous drive to win for our customers, the communities we serve, our fellow employees, and for our shareholders. Jessica? Sure. A very much anticipated question. So maybe I tried to talk about the market more generally, both inside of the third quarter. What we're -- what we think about the fourth quarter and where that does or doesn't position us for next year. But I think as you mentioned, there's a lot of puts and takes inside the third quarter. Underlying all that is that we are competing very well in a marketplace that still has lots of competition, lots of new competition with expanded footprint. In the third quarter, we did have some benefits that are unique to the third quarter, seasonality, which is typical. We also had a some, not large, but some impact from -- positive impact from a competitor who had a work stoppage. I think that's well understood. And then we had obviously the downside of significant ACP primarily through nonpay disconnects and voluntary churn, but we're managing that well. And in the fourth quarter, when you think about the seasonality and the work stoppage benefits, we won't have those inside the fourth quarter. We'll still have approximately 100,000 nonpay to deal with from ACP that we expect to see early in the quarter, in the fourth quarter. And we also have some hurricane impacts. And so that will impact subscribers, credits, as well as, Jessica mentioned, some capital and rebuild. And so then I think the bigger question is, as you look out, where does that leave us? We're not about managing for short-term for quarters. We're really about thinking about the long-term for the business. In 2025, there won't be ACP and we'll still have the continued tailwind of newly built passings, both organic as well as rural footprint. And then I think there's just the big questions or variables that will exist. Is lower interest rate environment, does that impact mortgages in a way that drives higher move rates? Have we seen the peak cell phone Internet impact? And it appears that that's the case. And can we drive even higher Internet sales as well as all of the additional bundling and higher product value packaging that I described through our new pricing and packaging, and really even more so than today, start to fully realize the benefits of mobile, not just through churn, but through additional Internet acquisition rates. And then finally, really a bogey variable, one that we wouldn't bet on, but I think is out there in terms of option values, can video, a reconstituted video, can that really provide broadband acquisition and retention support? So that's probably much longer to look towards the tail end of next year and beyond. But I think we're making the right investments and doing the right things to compete. We are still very much in an atypical low churn environment when you exclude ACP. And despite that, it's still a competitive environment for new sales. So I think if you step back, it's too early to declare victory or even plateau, but certainly a better unit growth setup for 2024 for 2025 than what we saw for 2024, I think, for us and probably for the rest of the cable industry. Yes. Sure. Let me start with the easy one, which is the last question you asked about Liberty Broadband. We've said what we can say for the time being through Liberty's 8-K and what there is very much public. I think we're going to have to stay quiet until there's something more to talk about in the meantime, at which point, of course, we'll talk through everything that you just asked. I know those are important questions. So unfortunately just going to have to deflect those for the time being. But if you step back to gig overlap, which includes all types of gig overlap in our footprint, it's roughly 55% today. And where it goes, I think, depends on people's access to capital, what happens in the M&A environment. But also, I think there are, as widely understood as I think there's probably some competing notions of that overlap footprint and where it may not be mutually exclusive. And as a result, I think people with the combination of scale back investment plans, plus recognizing that they're not going to be the X competitor that they thought they were going to be, may need or want to back off just because they're not going to be able to make returns. I've always thought that a wireline overbuild has very poor, if not negative, returns. And so when you start to have duplicative plans of multiple overbuilders, it really just makes it that much worse. It's actually terrible. So I think there is a realization that, that will take place. And so where it goes depends on somewhat the rational nature of our competitors and where they want to deploy capital. In the meantime, what can we do around that is we can continue to make the type of investments that we're making today is make sure that we have a symmetrical multi-gig wireline network across our entire footprint, have a seamless connectivity product through convergence that none of our competitors can ubiquitously use to compete. And then add to that the ability to save customers significant amounts of money, obviously, with mobile, where we offer tremendous advantage given our structure. But also in some of these rural footprints, as strange as that may sound, we offer customers the ability to save significant amounts of money with their wireline phone relative to what they pay. No. That's not in vogue to talk about, but the reality is something I think we could use specifically in that market to drive even faster penetration in the rural footprint. So overall, in our existing, inside of our new footprint, I think we have a great set of assets, a better and faster set of products, higher quality service because we're 100% onshore here in the US with sales and service, primarily with our own employees who are committed to that high-quality service. Then who knows, over time, the ability to add a unique video package that appeals to customers of all budget levels in terms of what they can afford and to deliver great value and utility inside the video package, I think, remains a big potential upside in terms of our ability to drive broadband and to compete against some of these competitors who don't have the same network seamless connectivity, packaging and product set and the ability to save customers money. I think we've got the best hand as it relates to our ability to compete in these marketplaces. What we typically see with any new overbuild, and that's not new, that's -- we have a lot of experience with this, it's been going on for probably 15 years, as you see an initial uptake, it can put a few points of penetration impact at the outset when somebody comes in for the first 18, 24 months and then the market kind of settles out. And so when we look to historical wireline overbuilders, many of which never got to the stated penetrations that today people say are required for return and that includes DSL conversion. I feel pretty good about where we can go over time, how we can compete. And the fact that at some point, the reality will be there that there's not a great financial return for wireline overbuilds when it's a single, much less if it's a multiple. Sure. It's a lot in that. Okay. I appreciate that you appreciate that the brand repositioning and the commitments that we're making are significant. I think it's really exciting for us and where we can go. It really comes about because we had made the significant investment in our own employees and investing in frontline tenure, which is progression and the ability for our employees to not just think about it as a job, but to have it as a career. And that gives us a higher quality craft than what you could have with contractors or offshore personnel. But at the same time, we really had not gotten the credit, I think, in the marketplace from customer satisfaction or NPS the way that we thought that reflected the investment that we've made. And so some of that comes down to doing a better job as a management team and avoiding some of the paper cuts that exist in customer service. The quality of service is there, the investment is there. This isn't a money issue. This is really trying to just, around the edges, how can you do better? That's one. Two is making sure that we had implemented some of the softer touch for customer service and to just give customers more recognition for their tenure with us and to remind them that we're local inside of their communities, and that these are committed employees to the company. And three is to really stand behind our service and back it up with guarantees, guarantees for service, and guarantees about what happens if we're honest when we fail to meet that service level that we've committed to customers and to stand behind that. And so most of that, which goes to your bill credit question, isn't going to be giving out bill credits. It's going to be reminding customers that that's the type of quality of service that they can expect from Charter from Spectrum. And to the extent that we miss, we're going to proactively apply credit and own it and apologize for where we don't get it right and to do a better job. I don't think the bill credits, there will be some incremental impact. I don't think it's going to be particularly material as it relates to ARPU. But what it does is it puts a pretty significant flashlight on us internally to make sure that what are those paper cuts, where are those service misses, and it provides a real incentive internally for us to go manage that down by providing even better and high quality of service. So a lot of this is just making sure that we get recognized for the investments that we've already made, but a lot of it also is forcing ourselves to be better and to do better. And then you match that service commitment at the same time with some of the ethos that was in what I described, which is around billing transparency and having high-quality services and products, which we do have, but even simple things about rounding the pricing, instead of $0.99, to rounding it to even dollars, and to having lower promotional pricing when bundled and lower persistent pricing when bundled in a way that not only saves customers money now, and we always did over time, but even more money over time to the extent they take more product from us. It's customer-friendly and competitive in the marketplace. So I'm really excited about it. There is, it is way, way too early, your question about any early impact of that. I think it's less about what you say and it's more about what you do and that takes time to be recognized in the marketplace. And so I think this is something that, maybe if we're lucky, back end of next year from just the customer commitments and service aspect, we could see the benefit of that. This is a multiyear process. It's not something that we're looking to immediately. But I think the good news, as you've highlighted, is we're very, very focused on our reputation in the marketplace, which impacts both customer acquisition as well as retention and the customer life, which has a better financial outcome for our shareholders as well as well as just being a great operator in the local communities we serve. Yes. It's the old strategy that you can lower your product pricing and have higher customer ARPU, both at the time of sale as well as over time, and have longer customer lives and have lower operating costs and, therefore, have better returns by doing the right thing. Thank you. Sure. On the Fiber-to-the-Home expansion, I don't have that number in front of me. I know when we started our rural build, we had roughly 750,000 passings or 750,000 miles planned. I think we're well over 900,000 today. If you think about how that's evolved over time, at the time we were 750,000 miles planned, we were about 50-50 in terms of construction that was between HFC and FTTH and we're now at close to 90% of the new build that we do is Fiber-to-the-Home. We do that simply because, on the increment, it's fine to do. The reality is what we see from a competitive standpoint as well as from a service standpoint, we see absolutely no difference. In fact, in our Fiber-to-the-Home footprint, oddly enough, we have a slightly higher troubled call rate than we do inside of our HFC plant on a 10-year adjusted basis for customers and plant construction. So I think that will normalize over time. Some of that's more software-driven related to OLTs and whatnot. But my big point there is zero difference to us in terms of the service quality or what we see really in competitiveness between the FTTH plant where we operate with HFC. The HFC over time is going to have certain advantages relative to fiber. And I would start by saying that, remember that, of our HFC plant, I don't know the exact stat, but whether it's 99.5% or 99.8% of our HFC plant really is fiber. And it's really at the end that it's coax on the run, which often is the case with Fiber-to-the-Home, in home wiring as well. So we're essentially the same network, except at the end, we have the advantage of having the ability to have more telemetry because of power and the ability to hang small cells from a wireless strategy perspective in a very capillary way. So we're spending time on really thinking through, over time, is the HFC network actually superior as a result of some of the capabilities that it will lend. I'm not there making that claim today, but I think there are some real advantages to the plant. And today, there's really no difference for us from what we see between one and the other. Do you want to jump in on? I agree. John, on the first question, Jessica is right about we focus on cash flow margin. But even with the percent over time, so I'm not talking at acquisition, but over time, I think it's important to note that our triple play bundles of different combinations. They have the highest dollars of EBITDA -- not only the highest ARPU, but the highest dollars of EBITDA contribution. They also have the lowest churn and the longest customer life and they have the best ROI. And that still is the case today, which comes back to our launch of the new Spectrum pricing and packaging is you just have to make sure that there's real value in the products that you're putting on the bill. And if there is, and it's a high-quality product, there's value and you have utility all packaged together, you can be in an environment where you have higher dollars of ARPU. You have higher dollars of margin. You have lower churn and lower operating cost per PSU. And even as a result of having a mix with products with different direct costs in there, you can end up long-term with higher EBITDA margin even as a percent also because your operating cost is much lower. Your churn is lower. And as a result, your subscriber acquisition cost is lower because you're not having to replace customers that you lost with new ones to fill the hole. And instead you're using your subscriber acquisition cost to acquire net new customers, which has the impact of increasing your dollar margin as well as your percent margin over the long-term. And that's the unique competitive advantage, I think, that we have is we have all those products, seamless connectivity and seamless entertainment in 100% of our footprint. And that's what we're trying to do is make better use of those capabilities. Yes. Why don't I take the first one, and Jessica, if you have thoughts on the second? I agree, we have a unique video offering and, at the same time, it's easy to get impatient as to how quickly we can get all that fully rolled out in a way that's easy for customers to understand, appreciate, sign up to, and utilize. And yet, when you think about that first half of 2025 that I talked about to fully operationalize it, it's really, that would only be 18 months from the time we first started to enter into these programming agreements. And so it's a relatively short period of time when we're going to be fully operationalized. So our goals, our priorities here was first to really focus on getting all these programming agreements done in a, I think, what turned out to be a 12 or 13 month period. So pretty quick to really run through all of those program agreements, some of which were early renewals because programmers were getting behind us. The second piece is to just physically get launched the programmer apps to form part of our seamless entertainment so that customers can subscribe to those. It's not the same because they have a broader direct-to-consumer businesses and we need to work with them on authentication as well as programmer specific credentials, which means that, in its current state, it's a high-value proposition, but it's not always easy to find and it's not always easy to subscribe and to manage your existing subscriptions potentially with those programmer apps. And so that's the environment that we sit today, which is good takeup, but not exactly the most customer-friendly proposition just yet, which is what we're working through. The second priority or the third priority, first is programming relationships, two was launch the direct-to-consumer app, third is to implement the ability for customers to upgrade to the ad-free version of these apps, only a couple of which has already been launched, so we're well in the progress with that as well. And then the final piece is really to put it all inside of what I would call a video portal, which allows you to manage all of your video subscription with us, including all of the programmer apps, when it's included as part of your offer, when it's upgraded to the ad free version, we have economics as well. And the ability to sell these programmer apps to our broadband customers or to our skinny package video customers, all in the same place where you can manage your subscriptions. And that's a compelling marketplace for video that we're developing today. And it requires for some pretty significant cooperation as well, as you can imagine, with the programmers. And we think we'll have all that placed in the first half of 2025 and be able to present that to customers as part of our pricing and packaging. I think there was some misconception in the marketplace that thought that we were going to do some big, huge marketing campaign and that would have a financial impact next year. That's really not the case. The investment we're making is the utility of finding all of this in a place that can manage your subscriptions and they've been able to activate all of that within Xumo in particular or other platforms. And the marketing and sales that we're doing really is tied to our new pricing and packaging as part of these bundles that we're putting out. So longer term, I expect all of that to have a pretty significant impact on acquisition and retention, certainly for video, but hopefully also with Internet when bundled together. Already without getting to that place that we expect to be next year we already see a significant uplift in the video sell-in just from the way that we're bundling and going to market with this new Spectrum pricing and packaging even without the benefit of that the video marketplace environment that I described. We're already seeing a pretty significant uplift. And the reason that we're comfortable with that is because we know the value is there, because of what's in place already today with some of the programmer apps and what's coming, what will be launched, and the ability to actually find and manage it in a better way. So we're pretty -- look, we're -- on one hand, we're excited about the space because it adds value. On the other hand, I want to be careful we're not forecasting video growth. We're simply saying that it's a way to add utility into our seamless connectivity relationships in a way that hasn't existed. And from our past experience, we know the value that can come about to the overall bundle by doing that right. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Before discussing our third quarter results, I want to mention that today's results do not include any impact related to hurricanes Helene and Milton, which hit the Southeast in late-September and early-October. Our fourth quarter results will include some lost customers and passings related to the storm from both suppressed gross additions and the damaged or destroyed plant that Chris mentioned. We're still assessing the impacted areas and we expect to rebuild lost passings over time as our customers rebuild. We currently expect to incur approximately $100 million in incremental capital expenditures, the vast majority of which will be captured in our rebuild capital expenditures line. We have been providing bill credits to customers in impacted areas and those onetime credits will offset some fourth quarter revenue. We may also have some incremental operating expense, although we expect that to be relatively small. And we'll isolate the storm impacts when we report our fourth quarter results. Let's please turn to our customer results on Slide 8. Including residential and SMB, we lost a 110,000 internet customers in the third quarter, while in mobile, we added 545,000 lines. Video customers declined by 294,000 and wireline voice customers declined by 288,000. The end of the ACP program drove higher third quarter non-pay and voluntary churn among former ACP customers for a total estimated third quarter impact of approximately 200,000 internet losses. Incremental non-pay disconnects drove more than half of those losses and the rest of the impact was primarily driven by voluntary churn with a small impact from lower connects. We continued to do a very good job in managing the end of the program and we've retained the vast majority of our customers who were previously receiving an ACP benefit. Beyond ACP, we competed well across our footprint, but note that our third quarter internet net additions benefited from seasonal back-to-school connects and a work stoppage at one of our competitors, while fourth quarter customer results will include impacts from the storms up and about 100,000 incremental non-pay disconnects and some lagging voluntary disconnects, both related to the end of ACP. After those effects in the fourth quarter, we expect the onetime impacts from ACP to be behind us. Turning to rural. We ended the quarter with 696,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by a 114,000 in the third quarter and by 381,000 over the last 12 months. And we had 41,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We now expect to activate close to 400,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024. About 35% more than in 2023, but lower than our original 2024 plan of 450,000 due to shifting construction labor to rebuild activity in storm impacted markets. We expect our subsidized Rural Construction activity to recover by the end of the fourth quarter and that reacceleration of activity to put us on a higher pace in 2025 as planned. Our RDOF build should still be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to third quarter revenue on Slide 9. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 1.8%, while residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 1.8% year-over-year given promotional rate step ups, rate adjustments, the growth of Spectrum Mobile and $63 million of residential customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. These factors were partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower priced video packages within our base and $25 million of costs allocated to programmer streaming apps, which are netted within video revenue. As Slide 9 shows, in total, residential revenue grew by 0.3% year-over-year. Turning to commercial, total commercial revenue grew by 2% year-over-year with SMB revenue growth of 1% year-over-year, reflecting higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustments. Enterprise revenue grew by 3.7% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 5.7 percent year-over-year. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.9%. Third quarter advertising revenue grew by 18% year over year given political revenue growth. Excluding political, advertising revenue decreased by 6.3% year over year due to higher levels of inventory in the market, partly offset by higher advanced advertising revenue. Other revenue grew by 11.6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated third quarter revenue was up 1.6% year-over-year, which is 0.6% year-over-year when excluding advertising revenue and $68 million of customer credits in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. In the third quarter, total operating expenses grew by 0.2% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 10% year-over-year due to a 9.5% decline in video customers year-over-year, a higher mix of lighter video packages, and costs allocated to programmer streaming apps, which are now netted within video revenue, partly offset by higher programming rates and a $61 million benefit in the prior year period related to the temporary loss of Disney programming in September 2023. Other costs of revenue increased by 15.8%, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales and higher mobile service direct costs. Cost-to-service customers declined 0.5% year-over-year given productivity from our 10-year investments, including lower labor costs, partly offset by modest year-over-year growth in bad debt expense. Sales and marketing costs grew by 4.4% as we remained focused on driving customer acquisition and given our Life Unlimited brand relaunch in September. Finally, other expense grew by 2.3%. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 3.6% year-over-year in the quarter. And when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.7% year-over-year. Turning to net income. We generated $1.3 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the third quarter, in line with last year, as higher adjusted EBITDA was mostly offset by higher other expenses, primarily due to noncash changes in the value of financial instruments. Turning to Slide 11. Capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion in the third quarter, down about $400 million from last year's third quarter. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, $16 million higher than last year driven by our subsidized Rural Construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial greenfield and market billing opportunities. Third quarter capital expenditures excluding line extensions totaled $1.5 billion, which was lower than the prior year period by about $400 million. The decline was driven by core CapEx items, including CPE timing and lower than originally expected spend on network evolution given what Chris discussed earlier with respect to our Step 2 software certification. We now expect total 2024 capital expenditures to reach approximately $11.5 billion, down from approximately $12 billion previously. That update reflects full year 2024 line extension spend of approximately $4.3 billion, down from $4.5 billion, partly offset by slightly higher core CapEx, primarily due to the shift of some of our construction labor from rural efforts to hurricane rebuild activity. The update also includes 2024 network evolution estimated spend of approximately $1.1 billion, down from the previous estimate of $1.6 billion. Much of that originally planned 2024 spend is being pushed into 2026 and 2027. As Chris mentioned, we will update our multiyear capital expenditures outlook when we complete our 2025 operating plan and report our fourth quarter results in January. We now expect our total BEAD spend will be substantially less than our spend in RDOF, in each case, net of subsidies. That lower outlook reflects the most recent broadband map updates in terms of available unserved passings near our network and a little less favorable rules framework in BEAD when compared to RDOF and state grants. We have been in regular communication with the states in which we operate and we are generally the largest rural builder in our states through RDOF, ARPA and other grants. While we're still finishing the 2025 operating plan, it's clear 2025 capital expenditures will not exceed the range of capital spend that we outlined in January of this year, even inclusive of a small amount of initial BEAD pending. Looking beyond 2025, we expect total capital spending in dollar terms to be on a meaningful downward trajectory, even inclusive of BEAD spending. So total capital intensity is now poised to decline significantly after 2025 even including the unique onetime opportunity that subsidized rural spend and network evolution has presented us. While we always prioritize our cash flow for organic opportunities first and then accretive M&A and buybacks, there are no organic capital expenditure opportunities on the horizon that give us concern with that capital intensity outlook. Free cash flow in the third quarter totaled $1.6 billion, an increase of approximately $520 million compared to last year's third quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and lower CapEx. We finished the quarter with $95.1 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.0 billion. We repurchased just under 850,000 Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $260 million at an average price of $311 per share, less than we had originally expected as we became restricted as a result of our negotiations with Liberty Broadband. As of the end of the third quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.22 times. We remain committed to our levered equity strategy and to share repurchases as a component of that strategy. Our leverage ratio may decline further given our pause and buybacks, but we look forward to resuming our program when we are able and we have not changed our target leverage. And with that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Maybe the one early item that I think is really clear that's worth pointing out though is that the bundled strategy in what was rolled out in the new pricing and packaging is being really successful in doing the things that we hoped that it would do, which collectively should drive higher customer ARPU in terms of getting customers to take higher tiered packages, getting customers to take more products inside of those packages, and also sort of expanding the number of mobile lines that we're seeing sort of taken per customer. So the one piece, I think, that's been easy to see upfront is that, that strategy around sort of pushing value back into the bundle and utilizing that to drive higher customer ARPUs, I do think will be quite effective. Yes. On the lower BEAD participation and what we would do then in small-scale M&A. Craig, we always say we like cable businesses, we believe we operate them well. When there are small-scale opportunities that fit well with our footprint, we will often, go after those. They're typically so small that you sort of don't see them and how they fold in. But I think that we look at those opportunities the way that we look at any other opportunity and expanding our footprint in that way does make sense when it's at the right price. I don't necessarily foresee that there's a trade-off as between BEAD and doing small-scale M&A. I think we pursue both of those opportunities where they make sense and will drive returns for the company. Yes. So starting on the margin implications for the new pricing and packaging. What we think about when we look at the success of the program is what Chris was describing in terms of how do you drive the most product value to the consumer that generates the most revenue. And then really, I guess, I think of it as sort of the most cash flow per customer, which isn't margin as a percentage. It's margin as an absolute dollar value. And in that case, I think that we're quite confident that the new pricing and packaging will be really successful in driving additional cash flow per customer because of the value that we've pushed into the bundles and what that means for the total margin that we can generate on the services offered to those customers. Does that mean that margin as a percentage will go up? That one is less clear. I actually think that the video product is a bit more attractive in the new pricing and packaging as we pull it together. And so because of that, your mix around how much video versus how much mobile and how much Internet might change. Mix tends to drive margin percentage across the company. And in this case, it might get you to the wrong answer because I think that we can drive the most collective margin by driving the most products to the customer. On the EBITDA front, thinking about the fourth quarter and next year, we still anticipate strong EBITDA growth in Q4, though it might not accelerate the way that we had hoped given that some of our expense reduction impacts, I think, came in a little earlier than we expected and we will have the storm impacts that hit inside of Q4. Still strong, but maybe not accelerating. And then going into next year, we're, of course, going to target EBITDA growth. But there are some meaningful headwinds, which I think include our Internet customer losses in 2024 and a nonpolitical year for advertising. Even with that, our expense reduction efforts, which I've mentioned before, include things that are both short-term and have already rolled in as well as some medium and longer-term items that are still building. I think that they'll put us in a good place. But there are meaningful headwinds as we go into next year. I'll take the other one on the mobile called roll-to-pay rates. We still see our free lines converting to being paying customers at very strong rates. In terms of the impact that has on ARPUs across the system, so once you get to, I'm going to say normalized, but once you get to a similar number of overall free lines inside of the system in a year-over-year, then you no longer end up with the same sort of boosts or impact of the year-over-year -- the same year-over-year impact on ARPU. So if I think about Internet ARPU there, as an example, Internet ARPU grew 2.8% on a GAAP basis. It would have been 3.1%, excluding the GAAP allocations, which is a closer tie between the two of those than what we've seen previously. And I think going forward, you'll find those coming together. On the other side, mobile ARPU actually was up and is looking really good. But the increase that you see in mobile ARPU related to the uptake of our Unlimited Plus plans, which really has been driven by anytime upgrade and I think could be driven further given some of the incentives that we have around it in the new pricing and packaging plans. So we're seeing, I guess, good growth in ARPU, but not as much at this point related to the roll-off of free lines in the system, not because the free lines aren't performing well, but just because the free lines now as a portion of the total base are more normalized. Thanks."

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I will now turn the call over to Stefan Anninger.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, operator, and welcome, everyone. The presentation that accompanies this call can be found on our website, ir.charter.com. I would like to remind you that there are a number of risk factors and other cautionary statements contained in our SEC filings, which we encourage you to read carefully. Various remarks that we make on this call concerning expectations, predictions, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from historical or anticipated results. Any forward-looking statements reflect management's current view only and Charter undertakes no obligation to revise or update such statements. On today's call, we have Chris Winfrey, our President and CEO, and Jessica Fischer, our CFO. With that, let's turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we lost 149 ,000 internet customers, most of which was driven by the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program. We added over 550,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.2 million lines year-over-year. Revenue was up slightly in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6%. We put a lot of effort into the ACP program, and it wasn't renewed. Beginning early this year, we've been actively working with customers to preserve their connectivity. Our service and retention teams are handling the volume of calls well, and we've retained the vast majority of ACP customers so far. The real question is customers' ability to pay, not just now, but over time. I expect we'll have a better view of the total ACP impact once we're inside the fourth quarter. The lack of ACP will also drive higher levels of market churn and selling opportunities for connectivity services over time. Turning back to today's results, the second quarter already tends to be a seasonally weak quarter. The loss of ACP impacted both churn and low-income broadband connects, helping drive the Mobile-only broadband category back to pre-pandemic levels. That shift added to an already low level of move activity and overall market connect volume. That said, we performed better than our expectations for Internet in a quarter, and we competed well compared to previous quarters against both wireline overbuild and cell phone Internet, each with expanded footprints. Overall churn remains at low levels, even with the end of the ACP program, and we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy, long-term growth. Our Internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. We expect market activity and selling opportunities to pick up over time, and the cell phone companies will face challenges. as a customer bandwidth demands continue to grow. If we take a step back, our success will be premised on our high capacity, fully deployed network and the products it can deliver. We already have a one gigabit network everywhere we operate across 58 million passings. And when our network evolution initiatives complete, we'll have a ubiquitous, symmetrical, multi-gig capable network supporting continued growth in data demand from customers and new applications such as AR, VR and AI. All at an incremental investment of just a $100 per passing. Those wireline network capabilities are combined with mobile capabilities everywhere we operate, creating the nation's first converged network. Uniquely providing seamless connectivity and the fastest mobile service where 87% of traffic is delivered by our own gigabit capable WiFi network. And our converged connectivity product set is poised to get better through speed upgrades and over 43 million access points, which will grow with our own and our partner's ongoing WiFi router and CBRS access point deployment. That converged network is also expanding, covering more passings as we grow our footprint with high ROI construction opportunities in both rural and non-rural areas. As we show on slide 4 of today's investor presentation, we are very well positioned competitively with higher quality products, lower pricing, and the ability to deliver a converged bundle of products. In Internet, data usage continues to grow and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During the second quarter, roughly 30% of residential internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us, used over a terabyte of data per month, which together with overall usage is increasing. This quarter, we saw the most additions to our gig speed tier ever, an area we can grow. Our mobile offering continues to evolve, driving strong results. Our second quarter mobile line Net Ad performance was better than the first quarter results, even without the incremental benefit of our free mobile retention offer to former ACP customers. And we also had our highest port ends quarter ever. In April, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to new and existing Unlimited Plus customers. Anytime Upgrade allows Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees, and condition requirements. And during the second quarter, customers increasingly chose our Unlimited Plus package priced at $40 versus $30. In April, we also launched a new repair and replacement plan for just $5 per month. That price point is very competitive in driving higher take rates. These new affordable value-added services enhance our profitable growth and competitively open access to new customer segments. Along those lines, in May, we launched our new phone balance buyout program. Now when a customer switches to the Spectrum Mobile from another provider and purchases at least three lines, we'll pay off their existing phone balance on ported lines up to $2,500 for five lines. This new program helps multiline mobile customer prospects with device balances and other providers to more easily switch to Spectrum Mobile. And of course, Spectrum One continues to perform well at both Connect and at promotional roll-off, offering the fastest connectivity with differentiated features. Today, approximately 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. We've remained underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market -leading pricing at promotion and at retail. Finally, turning to video, losses continued in video where we've seen downgrade churn from programmer rate increases, we passed through. The loss of ACP in the second quarter also impacted video downgrades as customers made choices based on affordability. Over the last several years, due to margin pressure from programming increases, we've moved away from selling bundles with traditional discounts. But as we look to better differentiate ourselves in a competitive marketplace, we are considering ways to better leverage our unique capabilities across our full set of products, including video, particularly now that we're adding significant value back into the video product for consumers with hybrid linear DTC bundles, more economical package choices, and with our Xumo Box. In May, we reached a new agreement with Paramount that gives us the ability to offer the ad-supported versions of Paramount's direct-to-consumer services, Paramount Plus and VET Plus, to our traditional cable package customers at no additional cost. We plan to launch the Paramount DTC inclusion offer to our customers around Labor Day. Earlier this month, ViX, the leading Spanish language DTC product from TelevisaUnivision became available to a large number of customers with eligible spectrum video packages at no extra cost. We launched Disney Plus Basic to TV Select customers as a DTC inclusion in January, and will begin to offer Disney Plus Premium to add free version of Disney Plus to customers as a $6 upgrade later this quarter. We also have planned to offer Hulu to our TV Select customers at the incremental retail price for Disney's duo basic bundle $2 in the fourth quarter. So our efforts to deploy a new hybrid DTC linear model first for the industry remain on track and we expect it to be fully deployed next year. Together with Xumo our goal is to deliver utility and value for our customers irrespective of how they want to view content and better and more stable economics for programming partners. But the associated DTCs have to be part of the full package service. Customers can't be forced to pay twice and if the DTC standalone pricing is less expensive at retail, then that's what we really should help programmers sell instead. Fundamentally, we believe that evolving the video business even if it isn't growing helps customer acquisition of retention, still has positive cash flow, it provides us with option value. And over time, we believe a high quality video product gives us the opportunity to reintroduce more value into the converged connectivity relationship. So stepping back, we're executing well on many multiyear transformational programs. We're growing EBITDA despite the loss of ACP and a competitive cycle by driving efficiency without impacting our service and sales capabilities. We remain fully focused on driving growth using our unique set of scaled assets and the highest quality products and services in order to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica.\nJessica Fischer : Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 149,000 Internet customers in the second quarter. While in Mobile, we added 557,000 mobile lines. Video customers declined by 408,000 and wireline voice customers declined by 280,000. As Chris mentioned, our second quarter Internet losses were primarily driven by the end of the ACP program. ACP program connects ended in early February. In May, the program's original $30 subsidy was reduced to $14. And in June, that subsidy was reduced to zero. We estimate that the end of the program's impact on our second quarter internet gross additions and churn drove over 100,000 of our 149,000 internet losses in the quarter. And from a financial perspective, there was an approximately $30 million headwind to second quarter revenue from onetime non-recurring ACP related items in the quarter. In addition, similar to the end of the Keep Americans Connected program in June 2020, many of our ACP customers had past due balances that had been fully reserved for accounting purposes. We took steps to eliminate a portion of those back balances for certain customers and put a portion of their remaining balances on payment plans. For certain customers with a low likelihood to pay post ACP, we have been recognizing revenue on a cash basis, resulting in slightly less revenue and less bad debt in the second quarter than we would have otherwise had. So far, we are performing well with ACP retention, but the largest driver of Internet customer losses associated with the end of the ACP program will be in non-pay disconnects, and they will occur in the third and fourth quarters, likely weighted to the third. We continue to do everything we can to preserve connectivity for former ACP subsidy recipients. We have a number of products and offers to assist those that have lost their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program, our Internet 100 products, and we've been offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for one year. And we continue to market offers targeted at low income customers, a segment that we have historically served well. Turning to rural, we ended the quarter with 582,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 89,000 in the second quarter and by 345,000 over the last 12 months. We had 36,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2023, about 50% more than 2023. We also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to second quarter financial results starting on slide 7. Over the last year, Residential customers declined by 1.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.4% year-over-year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, and some internet ARPU compression related to retention offers extended to customers that previously received an ACP subsidy. As slide 7 shows, in total, Residential revenue declined by 0.6% year-over-year. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 0.6% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 0.2% year-over-year and higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustment. Enterprise revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.1% year-over-year. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise grew by 5.9%. Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 3.3% year-over-year, given political revenue growth. Core ad revenue was down about 2% year-over-year. Other revenue grew by 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year and 0.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising revenue. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 8, in the second quarter, total operating expenses declined by 1.4% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.8% year-over-year due to a 9.5% decline in video customers year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Other costs of revenue increased by 12.6%, primarily driven by mobile service direct costs and higher mobile device sales. Cost-to-service customers declined 4.2% year-over-year given productivity from our 10-year investments, including lower labor costs and lower bad debt expense, as we saw some favorability and our mobile bad debt as a portion of revenue due to an improved customer tenure and credit profile. And, as I mentioned earlier, a portion of our uncollectible billings offset revenue in the quarter. Sales and marketing costs grew by 1.9% as we remain focused on driving customer acquisition. Finally, other expense grew by 4.7%, mostly driven by an insurance expense benefit from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter, and when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year. While we don't manage the business at a single product line P&L level, we continue to compute allocations internally, and this quarter, for the first time, our standalone mobile adjusted EBITDA was positive, even when including the headwind of subscriber acquisition costs and without the benefit of GAAP revenue allocation to mobile revenue. Our mobile profitability this quarter marks a significant milestone. It shows that we're on the path to establishing a mobile business that is very profitable. Overall, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can continue to do that even as we make significant investments in the business and face a challenging competitive environment and the end of the ACP program. Our expense management process is working with growing realization of impacts in the second quarter. We continue to expect accelerating EBITDA growth in the back half of the year, given our expense management initiatives, Spectrum 1 promotional roll-off, and political advertising revenue. Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, in line with last year, as higher adjusted EBITDA was mostly offset by higher other operating expense, primarily due to restructuring and severance costs and net amounts of litigation settlements. Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.85 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial green sales and market fill-in opportunity. Second quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.7 billion, which was similar to the prior year period. For the full year 2024, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $12 billion, down from between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion previously. Our reduced outlook for 2024 capital spending reflects lower internet and video customer net additions, including the impact of the end of the ACP program, which drives lower CPE costs. We're also actively managing vendor rates and construction materials to make our capital expenditures more efficient. We still expect line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion, and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. Turning to free cash flow on slide 11, free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $630 million compared to last year's second quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash taxes due to timing, and a favorable change in working capital. On that front, we've been managing the balance sheet to provide us better overall cash flow and increased flexibility. Over the last several quarters, we sold our towers portfolio, which generated almost $400 million in proceeds. We launched our EIP securitization program in the second quarter, which backs a new $1.25 billion credit facility at favorable interest rates. And we've been working with our vendor base to extend our payment terms, utilizing a supply chain financing tool to support our working capital favorability. We will continue to identify and capitalize on balance sheet opportunities to help fund our unique one-time capital investments. We finished the quarter with $96.5 billion in debt principle. Our current rent rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion, and we repurchased $1.5 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $404 million at an average price of $271 per share. Given our long dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our rent rate interest expense would be less than $60 million. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.32x. We expect to continue to move closer to the middle of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year. And we remain fully committed to maintaining our split rated debt structure, including access to the investment grade market, given the significant benefits that it offers to all of our capital providers. We continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We have the best products at the best prices in our industry, and we remain under penetrated relative to our long-term potential. That combined with the investments that we're making in the business and our expense savings initiative will continue to drive strong EBITDA growth and value creation for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson.\nCraig Moffett: Hi. Thank you. Perhaps no surprise. I'd like to drill down a little bit more on the ACP impacts. A couple of questions. First, to what extent are you seeing ACP showing up in reduced gross editions that is just lower market activity because new customers can't sign up for or ACP customers who are moving can't continue to sign up for the program even before you start to see non-pay disconnects. And then second, what impact is it having on ARPU? You reported 1.7% broadband ARPU the same as last quarter. Had it not been for ACP, could you just tell us what that would have been as you're starting to now lap some of the Spectrum 1 discounts that were included in the numbers in the past?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. Hey, Craig. I'll take the first one. Jessica can take the second. For ACP, we estimated the impact was well over 100,000 inside the quarter to net editions loss. And for us to say that means that we have a high level of confidence probably higher than that. So half of which was from voluntary churn and the other half was coming from reduced gross editions, as you mentioned, from low income segments that had been connecting at a higher rate at a much lower rate once ACP disappeared. Of course, we saw some of that impact already inside of Q1. And we saw the same inside of Q2. So that's the drivers inside there, about half and half. And it's really the combination of those when I mentioned that we saw a reversion to the pre-pandemic mobile only broadband category where you've seen that category increase, which is taking out volume from the marketplace in terms of a source of acquisition. It's temporary. It's one time in nature. And so as we've spoken about before, it's really about just managing through that one-time impact and trying to make sure that we're doing all the right things for preserving that base, and keeping them connected, which we're doing, but also making sure that we're making the right investments and the right moves for the business as usual underlying growth trajectory. Jessica on the ARPU.\nJessica Fischer : Yes. So Internet ARPU increased 1.7% year-over-year in the quarter. If you adjusted, Craig, for the $30 million in one-time ACP related items that I mentioned and for the impact of the mobile revenue allocation, that ARPU growth would have been 2.7%. I didn't incorporate the cash basis accounting impact that I mentioned earlier. It's small, and unless those customers do end up paying at a rate that's higher than our expectation, I think it recurs in revenue going forward. But so I think you would have been, but for those two items, that's a 2.7%\nStefan Anninger : Thanks Craig. Operator, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JP Morgan.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I think, Chris, in the prepared remarks, you said you competed well against fixed wireless and fiber, even though their footprints are expanding. Given the prevalence of what we're seeing in terms of open access and other host cell provider getting into the mix and increasing the fiber availability, have you seen a demonstrable change in the fiber deployments year-to-date as you think about that insurgent or non-incumbent fiber bill to some extent? And again, just trying to think about that increase in open access and wholesaler, how does it change, if at all, how you're thinking about the competitive environment on a go-forward basis in terms of other converged players or options moving into your footprint?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. Look, the competitive fiber overbuild has maintained a relatively steady pace. If anything, it's slightly lower than what it had been. And so we don't see any dramatic change there. When I talked about maintaining our competitiveness means having a similar impact, despite the fact that you have an expanding footprint. So you could, if I was being bullish, I would argue that that's an improvement, and as opposed to just staying steady. And so we're competing well, both in the wireline overbuild space, which is more permanent, as well as the cell phone internet space as well. In terms of some of the experiments that you're seeing as it relates to wholesale access and whatnot, it's still a fiber overbuild at the end of the day. And there's still economics that need to be deployed. And those economics are, in my mind, are not very good. They haven't been for decades of the economics of an overbuilder on an existing footprint. So I don't think it, A, dramatically changes the outputs that they can provide because the economics aren't any different, and B, it's really small. What you're talking about that's been done is just a very small percentage of the U.S. footprint. So the ability to project products both from a sales and marketing and service perspective really is impacted by the ubiquitous nature of the technology that you have and the ability to provide those products in the marketplace. And so from our perspective, when we look at it and say, what's unique about us is we have a gigabit network deployed everywhere we operate. In addition to that, we're upgrading that wireline network to have symmetrical and multi-gig speeds everywhere, not just in redline pockets, but everywhere that we operate, and then you combine that with our WiFi and CBRS capabilities and a very strategic relationship that we have with a great partner in Verizon, it gives us the ability to provide seamless connectivity, converged broadband everywhere you go inside of our footprint, and that's unique. The only other operator who has those type of capabilities really is Comcast. And so I think that's the real strategic advantage for us, and it's not because we have that capability in 2%, 3%, or 5% of our footprint. We have it everywhere we operate, and it allows us to be loud in the marketplace, talk about not only the product advantages of having that seamless connectivity, but the ability to save customers hundreds and thousands of dollars really with a better product. And so I don't see anything that's really changed. Other than some of these joint ventures announcements that you've seen, if you really sit back and think about it from both a strategy and from a valuation perspective, I think it's flattering. It tells you the strategic asset that we have. And so if you take a look at the slide that we have on page 4 of the deck today, you think about everything that I said and our capabilities, and then you think about where others are trying to go, many of the MNOs, I do think that's flattering both from a strategic, from an operating and from evaluation perspective of what we have and what we're capable of doing. It has people's attention.\nSebastiano Petti: And if I could ask a quick follow-up on wireless, it sounds, I think you noted that even excluding the retention offer for the ACP subscribers, mobile lines would have been up. I mean, can you help us think about what you're seeing in terms of just the contract buyout and some of the other offers you have in the market, and does your maybe go-to-market need to evolve at all as we think about obviously fears or concerns about what an upgrade cycle might mean from the Apple iPhone in the back half of the year. Thank you.\nChris Winfrey: Sure. Well, mobile wasn't just up. What I was saying is it was up quarter-over-quarter. We had a very good first quarter. It was clearly up even more this quarter. And if you excluded the benefit of the ACP mobile only, mobile retention offers, we still would have been better than a very strong first quarter. That reflects just the general momentum that we have, but also, we have evolved the product. And so we've rolled out the Anytime Upgrade Program, which is unique in the market. We have even though it sounds small, it's attractive to customers, service, and repair function that's, I think, competitive. And now with the phone balance buyout program, which is also pretty unique in the marketplace. And all of those rolled out sequentially during the course of the quarter and have continued to improve our selling capabilities along the way. I think that positions us well in any market. We've not been, I think, where you were going, we've not been, we don't intend to be in the business of subsidizing phones. But we do have really good programs that make it attractive for customers to not only come in to be a customer spectrum mobile, but also to stay with us because we have the ability through the Anytime Upgrade Program to really at a low competitive cost, keep them current with their models of phones now and in the future. And stating the obvious, the biggest advantage here beyond just the devices really is the ability to provide a higher quality, faster mobile service, seamless connectivity, and to be able to save them hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. I mean, if you think about our pricing at $30 for unlimited and $40 for unlimited plus on one line and each incremental line, it's really competitive. It's very good. So we're happy with where we are with the product. We will continue to evolve it. I think some of those feature sets that will evolve really include things like mobile speed boost, which ties to the capabilities that we have with WiFi and wireline, and the ability to have spectrum mobile as an SSID. So those of you in the New York and LA markets, for example, what you'll notice is as you travel outside of your home with Spectrum Mobile, an auto-authenticated attachment to Spectrum Mobile SSID, which boosts your speed wherever you go, and it increases your access and your reliability, which is the nature of seamless connectivity.\nStefan Anninger: Thanks, Sebastiano. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chaplin with New Street Research.\nJonathan Chaplin: Thanks, guys. Two questions. One just on broadband market growth for Chris, and then one on free cash flow for Jessica. Chris, could you give us a little bit more context around the ACP impact from lower gross ads in 1Q? I think you said it was sort of roughly the same as in 2Q, so maybe it was 50,000, but what I'm trying to get to is an understanding of what's going on with underlying growth. It looks like it actually improved for you a little bit sequentially, and so either broadband market growth in aggregate isn't getting any worse, maybe it's getting a little better, or you're just doing better on market share relative to your competitors. And we'd love to understand that a little bit better. And then Jessica, it sounded like from your discussion of working capital that this isn't a timing impact in 2Q. You've changed how you manage working capital, and so you should expect to be able to sort of retain this benefit to free cash flow as we go through the year. I just wanted to confirm that. And then do you have to get all the way back to 4.2x to 4.25x leverage before you would accelerate share repurchases again? Thanks.\nChris Winfrey: So Jonathan, there's I think a few derivatives inside of your question. And so let me try to give you what you're looking for in the way that we think about it. And inside of the first quarter, we had performed better relative to prior quarters and prior year on competitive switching. And so that was in the marketplace, so available subscriber ads and disconnects. But we saw, as you highlighted as well, once everybody had reported, we saw a significant reduction in the first quarter of this year in the available gross ads, a significant drop year-over-year and that was due to housing starts, rental vacancies, but also the removal of ACP for new connects, all of which driving your version to mobile-only back to pre-pandemic levels. That broadband market growth rate overall we still saw is significantly reduced for all those factors inside of Q1 but a dramatic drop, and so that put our performance in relative light given the overall market backdrop, a lot of which was one time in nature. In Q2, and while it's early because we don't have all the data, I think our evidence shows that for the first time and due to, again, all of the one-time factors and most dramatically the loss of ACP, the broadband market actually shrunk as a one-time event. And so if you put our performance and then our statements about relative competition in context with that, and I think we're doing pretty well. And that was the nature of the comments that I provided in the prepared remarks. I do think that, as I mentioned, moves will come back. It's hard to predict exactly when, but moves will come back, housing starts will return, apartment rental rates will go back up, and most importantly, the most dramatic effect is once you flush out the ACP impact between Q2 and Q3 predominantly, then you'll be able to get back into a much more normalized environment. And I think the product investments that we're making and the attractiveness of the value that we provide puts us in great position for when that volume returns, and we're doing everything we can in the meantime to preserve all the ACP customers doing really well, but at the same time making sure that we're ready to come out in a good light on the back end once the volume does pick back up.\nJessica Fischer : On the free cash flow side, Jonathan, so I think we had previously talked about working capital for the year, coming back to being in a place that was relatively flat. As I said, we're working on the balance sheet and trying to make sure we can extract appropriate cash from the balance sheet to support what we're doing across the business. I think that we'll probably do better than that sort of flat working capital expectation, but I'm not prepared to say by exactly how much. The variability in working capital has a lot to do with exactly how expense timing and capital timing lands over the course of the year, and so while I think that we'll get good benefits out of just the balance sheet management side, I'm not going to take up the total thoughts that we've had on working capital today. On your other question, sort of how do we think about, I think it was sort of a one and then the other. Do you have to get all the way back to the middle of your range before you accelerate buybacks? I'm in the same place that I was last quarter, which is that I think that we can continue to do buybacks over the course of the rest of the year and still do what we have said that we would do from a leverage perspective. And I don't think of it as do you have to do one and then the other. I'm pretty confident in the trajectory of the business for the second half of the year. And so, I think that we can have sort of good pacing on buybacks and meet what we've said about leverage at the same time. That being said, the capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We still go after high ROI, organic investment first. We still look then at whether there's a creative M&A opportunity is next. And those come before sort of this balance sheet management and share buybacks that happens as the last set of priorities there. And so, we haven't given a guide around where we think that we'll go in terms of total buybacks. It's because we want to make sure that we maintain that flexibility to do what we think is most important for the business, which is to make the right investments to drive growth of the business going forward.\nStefan Anninger: Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Chris, I believe you guys took some cost action. I don't know if there were headcount reductions this year at Charter, but I know you guys have had a cost plan you've been working on. I'm wondering if you could just talk about what you guys are doing and how you're approaching that. And I think you had suggested you guys weren't going to touch any sort of customer-facing resources. So just give us a sense of where you are on that and your philosophy as you look through the rest of the year and how we might think about that impacting the financials. And then maybe for Jessica, I don't know if you have any visibility at this point into Q3, ACP impact from that 100,000, but if you do, I'd love to hear it. And try to understand the decline in bad debt. I know you touched on it in your prepared remarks. I don't know if that tells us something about your third quarter ACP expectation, or if you still expect cost of service to be flat for the year, we just want a little more color around those trends. Thank you both.\nChris Winfrey: Hey, Ben. So there's kind of three parts to that, which is, I'll start with the second one you had, is the Q3 ACP. I'll handle that. And Jessica can comment on bad debt and then cost reductions. Jessica can go through and I can tag team there a bit. But from a Q3 ACP outlook, we're not going to be providing any customer net additions guidance today, but for sure there's going to be, as we both mentioned, I think Jessica and I, that there'll be more non-pay disconnect in the third quarter. But there are a lot of other moving parts and we're competing well. I think that maybe the interesting tidbit here is maybe talking a little bit more about recent trends. June was oddly the best loss of the second quarter. And internet net ads trends in July have been similar to what we saw in June. Sounds great. But the reality is the ACP related non-pay disconnect activity hasn't started yet. And we'll know really more about sustainable payment trends than nothing to be scared of today, but sustainable payment trends really through August with the non-pay beginning then and trailing into a little bit into Q4. So when you step back, I know you know this, but ultimately this ACP transitions are onetime event. And so we're very focused on really isolating the ACP impact internally and evaluating not only obviously our performance on retaining those customers because we want to keep them connected. We think it's very valuable and we can, but also what's the underlying trend absent the ACP impact to make sure that we're getting better every day. So Jessica on the ACP does bad debt piece.\nJessica Fischer : Yes. So if you think about what happened in bad debt in the year-over-year, Ben, there's a few things going on. One really with tenure and credit profile in our mobile customer base that's been improving, particularly for customers that have EIP plans with us. And on the ACP front, we took a lot of bad debt along the way, particularly for customers who entered the ACP program and they had outstanding unpaid balances. And so those have really been reserved throughout the ACP program. I mentioned it in the remarks but there also is a portion of the ACP customer base where we have a very low expectation of payment for them and so instead of taking their revenue into revenue and then taking bad debt expenses and offset, we actually didn't recognize revenue for those customers. So when you see that it means that bad debt expense, I think absent that you might have had -- you would have had more bad debt expense if we had put that back in the other direction. And then the last point I mean we did have overall lower resi revenue in 2Q in the year-over-year and some mixed changes and so with other things being equal that also drives a little bit of downward pressure on bad debt. All of that is to say I wouldn't read anything sort of into what is it that you think about Q3 and looking at what happened with bad debt in the year-over-year, I think there are a number of factors going on there. As you think about then what's happening on the overall cost reduction side which I think was your other question. The expense management process is pretty extensive. While we're not doing anything that will impact our sales or service capabilities, we have things that are big things that are small some short some medium some long-term opportunities all across the business. We've made progress with some vendor cost reductions with reduced spend around discretionary categories like real estate and third-party services, some reductions to overhead expenses and implementing some tools to increase our efficiency and actually I think the benefits from those came a little faster into 2Q than what we had anticipated, but we're already realizing the benefits of some of the changes will continue to build on additional opportunities over time. As you look at the rest of the year, I think we had given some thoughts on our outlook for expenses. We had expected programming costs per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. I now expect that to be flattish year-over-year. We previously had said that we expected costs to serve to be flat with 2023. I now expect that to decline by 1% to 2% inclusive of bad debt expense. And in sales to marketing, I think we had said 2% to 3% growth. And at this point, I would expect us to be in the low end of that range, if not a bit below. I also, as an aside, just want to clarify something I said earlier. My comments on working capital. I want to be clear that the comments on working capital are on cable working capital. Mobile continues to have the detriment of the EIP notes. And so those will continue to be a drag, though the securitization plan that we did in the quarter does help that.\nChris Winfrey: And on the cost if you just take one a different layer of look, the, so Jessica's right, we're doing lots on vendor savings, overheads, organizational effectiveness lower growth environment, all that's true, but just want to make sure everybody understands that the key focus for us in terms of real permanent lasting and accelerating cost reduction is just to be a better service operator. So continue to invest in our frontline, have better tools, process and systems to make the investments that we've made in tenure. And we see that, and so we are having real results from some of the one time and permanent cost reductions, but we're also probably having bigger success on reducing the amount of service calls, reducing our truck roles, increasing the quality of the service that we provide, that's where the money's at. And then when you think about operating leverage, which is a term that you've used before the best way to have a better operating leverage is to have more customers and to have more products per household and have higher revenue. And that way you can, together, being a better service operator and having higher penetration of your products, you actually lower your cost to serve per customer, you lower your cost of capital per customer as well and you become a better cash flow operator. So all of those things still hold true. And it's why, when we talk about expense management, that we talk about really not doing anything that would impact sales or service, because that's the true efficiency opportunity and that's the opportunity to deliver long-term free cash flow and our views on that and our frontline hasn't changed at all.\nStefan Anninger : Thanks, Ben. Operator, we'll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities.\nJessica Ehrlich: Question on video, I guess, can you talk about the take-up of direct-to-consumer in these hybrid linear offers? And you've mentioned a couple that are coming, Paramount Plus and Hulu, is there anything else on the horizon? And then secondly, you mentioned political advertising should pick up in the second half. Given the current political environment, can you give us some color and expectations and if that's increasing?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. On the first one, Jessica, the DTC take-up is going very well. The first one, I know a lot of people think about Disney deals in September, but we launched I think late in January on Disney Plus Basic and it's going well and it's growing every month. We're adding some additional features into it, which will be helpful to even further accelerate the monthly growth that we see. That includes, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, the addition of the Disney Plus Premium as an incremental add-on. That will be coming soon, as well as the Disney Duo Basic bundle of plus $2 for Hulu. So that allows you to have a comprehensive package the same way that exists inside of retail and that's helpful, it was always the design. But there's complexity in terms of implementing all of this, also because some of the authentication principles that vary between different operators in terms of credentials and TV everywhere and whatnot. But it's going well and accelerating, ESPN Plus, I didn't mention that on the call, it's also having very good take-up, it's high value into our RSN packages, it's a small portion of the base, but the penetration is going well. And Paramount Plus will launch soon and ViX we just launched and we've always had Max and so that has existed already within the TV everywhere authenticated universe and our expectation is over the next year or so that we'll have a fully baked set of products which really what we're working towards and the more scale we get there the more effective it's going to be. We're not sitting here saying that we're going to arrest completely the loss of video but I think what we are saying is to the extent we're going to put video on our broadband bill, it better have value and if it doesn't have value to the customer then we'd rather they just go take that through the direct-to-consumer applications and we need to be proud of what we're putting on the bill and that's not where the MVPD space has been in a long time as we see a path to being able to be proud of what we're putting on the broadband bill as a video product that it may be expensive but it has a significant amount of value and using that to drive the converge connectivity relationships. So while it may not be growing it's still really important and I think it can be very valuable to our converge connectivity relationships. In terms of what's up next, we're not going to go give a programming renewal schedule but we're optimistic that this has been adopted both from an understanding that the DTCs really do need to be included as part of the full video package. And that's actually better for programmers because of reduced churn and upsell opportunities into the ad-free versions of these products as well. And that look, at the end of the day, if a customer can go out and get the same product at a cheaper price in the marketplace, I think they should. I don't think we should ask them to pay more through us. And so those are some of the core principles that we've had. I'm not committing, but those are some of the bigger ones. And political advertising it's always, as you know, it's always a jump ball as to exactly where it's going to go. And it's evaluated on a state-by-state basis. And so you can't really say that it's an -- it's the same nationally everywhere. So it depends on some of the swing states. Admittedly the events of the past week have jumbled what you thought that might look like. And certainly when you take a look at fundraising and the volatility in what could be swing states, it looks like political advertising net-net nationally is going to be higher than what it probably would have been just a 10 days ago. But it doesn't mean it happens necessarily in the right states for us. And so we're keeping an eye on that. And it's nice when it happens, but it's one time in nature. And so that's why we always try to talk about our results with and without the impacts of political advertising. Because what is this year's windfall will be next year's headwind. And we want to make sure everybody's focused on the right thing, which is the underlying growth profile of the subscription business. Which includes the core advertising, which continues to do well with or without political advertising.\nStefan Anninger : Thanks, Jessica. Operator, we'll take our last question, please.\nOperator: Our final question will come from the line of Peter Cipino with Wolfe Research.\nPeter Cipino: Thanks and good morning. I have an ACP question that looks beyond the third quarter. Arguably, ACP has been history's greatest retention program for broadband operators and you took good advantage of it. Looking beyond the wave of involuntary disconnects in Q3 and not to say 2025, does that retention benefit go away? I mean, certainly it does. And then what needs to step up in its place or should we expect a slightly higher underlying churn rate attributable to those four or five million former ACP subs who go from having essentially no churn to maybe having a normal churn rate?\nChris Winfrey: Sure. Well, look, once upon a time there wasn't an ACP, but it's been a long time. When you think about, we had the, during the pandemic we had the, we were a big participant in the remote education offer, the Keep Americans Connected, the EBB, which evolved and became the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which evolved and became the ACP. And we've been a significant participant in all of those, as has the industry. I think we all have a lot to be proud of for stepping up and really driving those programs, but they didn't exist before. And broadband is a really important product. And from a charter perspective, we have ways to continue to address that marketplace. Before I go there, you asked about the market level activity. I do think that in an environment where ACP or an equivalent doesn't exist, that by definition you have more customers coming in and out of broadband based on affordability. That's rise up transaction volume, both from a non-pay disconnect, as well as from a gross ad sales perspective. When you have better products and better price, that can work towards your advantage. So it's not all bad from our perspective. And but we also have the ability to, at acquisition and for retention, offer unique products. Our Internet 100 is attractively priced. It's not for everybody, but it's affordable. We also, and you can pair that together with Spectrum One, so the ability to have a free mobile line for the first year, and then that line rolls to $30 after a year. If you think about a typical one-line environment or even in a typical two-line environment, the average cost of a line is over $60. And so even at retail rate of $30, we've built in a savings of $30 per month through taking mobile together with our attractively priced, high-powered broadband product. And that's as much, if not more, than the ACP benefit, which means that if you take our products, we can effectively -- we have the built -in ACP savings available to you when you really take full advantage of our product set. And so that is a product and a combination that didn't fully exist prior to all of these programs. And I think we can, by having a wider availability for low income population of these broadband offers, which we have together with our Spectrum 1 offer combined, I think we can save customers as much if not more than they were they're getting through ACP relative to the past. So I think we're in good position to be able to address the base. But the market activity, for sure, is going to be higher than what has been the past couple of years.\nStefan Anninger : Thanks, Peter. And that concludes our call. We'll see you next quarter.\nChris Winfrey: Thanks, everyone.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. During the second quarter, we lost 149 ,000 internet customers, most of which was driven by the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program. We added over 550,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.2 million lines year-over-year. Revenue was up slightly in the quarter, while adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6%. We put a lot of effort into the ACP program, and it wasn't renewed. Beginning early this year, we've been actively working with customers to preserve their connectivity. Our service and retention teams are handling the volume of calls well, and we've retained the vast majority of ACP customers so far. The real question is customers' ability to pay, not just now, but over time. I expect we'll have a better view of the total ACP impact once we're inside the fourth quarter. The lack of ACP will also drive higher levels of market churn and selling opportunities for connectivity services over time. Turning back to today's results, the second quarter already tends to be a seasonally weak quarter. The loss of ACP impacted both churn and low-income broadband connects, helping drive the Mobile-only broadband category back to pre-pandemic levels. That shift added to an already low level of move activity and overall market connect volume. That said, we performed better than our expectations for Internet in a quarter, and we competed well compared to previous quarters against both wireline overbuild and cell phone Internet, each with expanded footprints. Overall churn remains at low levels, even with the end of the ACP program, and we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy, long-term growth. Our Internet product is faster and more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. We expect market activity and selling opportunities to pick up over time, and the cell phone companies will face challenges. as a customer bandwidth demands continue to grow. If we take a step back, our success will be premised on our high capacity, fully deployed network and the products it can deliver. We already have a one gigabit network everywhere we operate across 58 million passings. And when our network evolution initiatives complete, we'll have a ubiquitous, symmetrical, multi-gig capable network supporting continued growth in data demand from customers and new applications such as AR, VR and AI. All at an incremental investment of just a $100 per passing. Those wireline network capabilities are combined with mobile capabilities everywhere we operate, creating the nation's first converged network. Uniquely providing seamless connectivity and the fastest mobile service where 87% of traffic is delivered by our own gigabit capable WiFi network. And our converged connectivity product set is poised to get better through speed upgrades and over 43 million access points, which will grow with our own and our partner's ongoing WiFi router and CBRS access point deployment. That converged network is also expanding, covering more passings as we grow our footprint with high ROI construction opportunities in both rural and non-rural areas. As we show on slide 4 of today's investor presentation, we are very well positioned competitively with higher quality products, lower pricing, and the ability to deliver a converged bundle of products. In Internet, data usage continues to grow and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During the second quarter, roughly 30% of residential internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us, used over a terabyte of data per month, which together with overall usage is increasing. This quarter, we saw the most additions to our gig speed tier ever, an area we can grow. Our mobile offering continues to evolve, driving strong results. Our second quarter mobile line Net Ad performance was better than the first quarter results, even without the incremental benefit of our free mobile retention offer to former ACP customers. And we also had our highest port ends quarter ever. In April, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to new and existing Unlimited Plus customers. Anytime Upgrade allows Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees, and condition requirements. And during the second quarter, customers increasingly chose our Unlimited Plus package priced at $40 versus $30. In April, we also launched a new repair and replacement plan for just $5 per month. That price point is very competitive in driving higher take rates. These new affordable value-added services enhance our profitable growth and competitively open access to new customer segments. Along those lines, in May, we launched our new phone balance buyout program. Now when a customer switches to the Spectrum Mobile from another provider and purchases at least three lines, we'll pay off their existing phone balance on ported lines up to $2,500 for five lines. This new program helps multiline mobile customer prospects with device balances and other providers to more easily switch to Spectrum Mobile. And of course, Spectrum One continues to perform well at both Connect and at promotional roll-off, offering the fastest connectivity with differentiated features. Today, approximately 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of internet and mobile. We've remained underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market -leading pricing at promotion and at retail. Finally, turning to video, losses continued in video where we've seen downgrade churn from programmer rate increases, we passed through. The loss of ACP in the second quarter also impacted video downgrades as customers made choices based on affordability. Over the last several years, due to margin pressure from programming increases, we've moved away from selling bundles with traditional discounts. But as we look to better differentiate ourselves in a competitive marketplace, we are considering ways to better leverage our unique capabilities across our full set of products, including video, particularly now that we're adding significant value back into the video product for consumers with hybrid linear DTC bundles, more economical package choices, and with our Xumo Box. In May, we reached a new agreement with Paramount that gives us the ability to offer the ad-supported versions of Paramount's direct-to-consumer services, Paramount Plus and VET Plus, to our traditional cable package customers at no additional cost. We plan to launch the Paramount DTC inclusion offer to our customers around Labor Day. Earlier this month, ViX, the leading Spanish language DTC product from TelevisaUnivision became available to a large number of customers with eligible spectrum video packages at no extra cost. We launched Disney Plus Basic to TV Select customers as a DTC inclusion in January, and will begin to offer Disney Plus Premium to add free version of Disney Plus to customers as a $6 upgrade later this quarter. We also have planned to offer Hulu to our TV Select customers at the incremental retail price for Disney's duo basic bundle $2 in the fourth quarter. So our efforts to deploy a new hybrid DTC linear model first for the industry remain on track and we expect it to be fully deployed next year. Together with Xumo our goal is to deliver utility and value for our customers irrespective of how they want to view content and better and more stable economics for programming partners. But the associated DTCs have to be part of the full package service. Customers can't be forced to pay twice and if the DTC standalone pricing is less expensive at retail, then that's what we really should help programmers sell instead. Fundamentally, we believe that evolving the video business even if it isn't growing helps customer acquisition of retention, still has positive cash flow, it provides us with option value. And over time, we believe a high quality video product gives us the opportunity to reintroduce more value into the converged connectivity relationship. So stepping back, we're executing well on many multiyear transformational programs. We're growing EBITDA despite the loss of ACP and a competitive cycle by driving efficiency without impacting our service and sales capabilities. We remain fully focused on driving growth using our unique set of scaled assets and the highest quality products and services in order to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Sure. Hey, Craig. I'll take the first one. Jessica can take the second. For ACP, we estimated the impact was well over 100,000 inside the quarter to net editions loss. And for us to say that means that we have a high level of confidence probably higher than that. So half of which was from voluntary churn and the other half was coming from reduced gross editions, as you mentioned, from low income segments that had been connecting at a higher rate at a much lower rate once ACP disappeared. Of course, we saw some of that impact already inside of Q1. And we saw the same inside of Q2. So that's the drivers inside there, about half and half. And it's really the combination of those when I mentioned that we saw a reversion to the pre-pandemic mobile only broadband category where you've seen that category increase, which is taking out volume from the marketplace in terms of a source of acquisition. It's temporary. It's one time in nature. And so as we've spoken about before, it's really about just managing through that one-time impact and trying to make sure that we're doing all the right things for preserving that base, and keeping them connected, which we're doing, but also making sure that we're making the right investments and the right moves for the business as usual underlying growth trajectory. Jessica on the ARPU. Sure. Look, the competitive fiber overbuild has maintained a relatively steady pace. If anything, it's slightly lower than what it had been. And so we don't see any dramatic change there. When I talked about maintaining our competitiveness means having a similar impact, despite the fact that you have an expanding footprint. So you could, if I was being bullish, I would argue that that's an improvement, and as opposed to just staying steady. And so we're competing well, both in the wireline overbuild space, which is more permanent, as well as the cell phone internet space as well. In terms of some of the experiments that you're seeing as it relates to wholesale access and whatnot, it's still a fiber overbuild at the end of the day. And there's still economics that need to be deployed. And those economics are, in my mind, are not very good. They haven't been for decades of the economics of an overbuilder on an existing footprint. So I don't think it, A, dramatically changes the outputs that they can provide because the economics aren't any different, and B, it's really small. What you're talking about that's been done is just a very small percentage of the U.S. footprint. So the ability to project products both from a sales and marketing and service perspective really is impacted by the ubiquitous nature of the technology that you have and the ability to provide those products in the marketplace. And so from our perspective, when we look at it and say, what's unique about us is we have a gigabit network deployed everywhere we operate. In addition to that, we're upgrading that wireline network to have symmetrical and multi-gig speeds everywhere, not just in redline pockets, but everywhere that we operate, and then you combine that with our WiFi and CBRS capabilities and a very strategic relationship that we have with a great partner in Verizon, it gives us the ability to provide seamless connectivity, converged broadband everywhere you go inside of our footprint, and that's unique. The only other operator who has those type of capabilities really is Comcast. And so I think that's the real strategic advantage for us, and it's not because we have that capability in 2%, 3%, or 5% of our footprint. We have it everywhere we operate, and it allows us to be loud in the marketplace, talk about not only the product advantages of having that seamless connectivity, but the ability to save customers hundreds and thousands of dollars really with a better product. And so I don't see anything that's really changed. Other than some of these joint ventures announcements that you've seen, if you really sit back and think about it from both a strategy and from a valuation perspective, I think it's flattering. It tells you the strategic asset that we have. And so if you take a look at the slide that we have on page 4 of the deck today, you think about everything that I said and our capabilities, and then you think about where others are trying to go, many of the MNOs, I do think that's flattering both from a strategic, from an operating and from evaluation perspective of what we have and what we're capable of doing. It has people's attention. Sure. Well, mobile wasn't just up. What I was saying is it was up quarter-over-quarter. We had a very good first quarter. It was clearly up even more this quarter. And if you excluded the benefit of the ACP mobile only, mobile retention offers, we still would have been better than a very strong first quarter. That reflects just the general momentum that we have, but also, we have evolved the product. And so we've rolled out the Anytime Upgrade Program, which is unique in the market. We have even though it sounds small, it's attractive to customers, service, and repair function that's, I think, competitive. And now with the phone balance buyout program, which is also pretty unique in the marketplace. And all of those rolled out sequentially during the course of the quarter and have continued to improve our selling capabilities along the way. I think that positions us well in any market. We've not been, I think, where you were going, we've not been, we don't intend to be in the business of subsidizing phones. But we do have really good programs that make it attractive for customers to not only come in to be a customer spectrum mobile, but also to stay with us because we have the ability through the Anytime Upgrade Program to really at a low competitive cost, keep them current with their models of phones now and in the future. And stating the obvious, the biggest advantage here beyond just the devices really is the ability to provide a higher quality, faster mobile service, seamless connectivity, and to be able to save them hundreds or thousands of dollars a year. I mean, if you think about our pricing at $30 for unlimited and $40 for unlimited plus on one line and each incremental line, it's really competitive. It's very good. So we're happy with where we are with the product. We will continue to evolve it. I think some of those feature sets that will evolve really include things like mobile speed boost, which ties to the capabilities that we have with WiFi and wireline, and the ability to have spectrum mobile as an SSID. So those of you in the New York and LA markets, for example, what you'll notice is as you travel outside of your home with Spectrum Mobile, an auto-authenticated attachment to Spectrum Mobile SSID, which boosts your speed wherever you go, and it increases your access and your reliability, which is the nature of seamless connectivity. So Jonathan, there's I think a few derivatives inside of your question. And so let me try to give you what you're looking for in the way that we think about it. And inside of the first quarter, we had performed better relative to prior quarters and prior year on competitive switching. And so that was in the marketplace, so available subscriber ads and disconnects. But we saw, as you highlighted as well, once everybody had reported, we saw a significant reduction in the first quarter of this year in the available gross ads, a significant drop year-over-year and that was due to housing starts, rental vacancies, but also the removal of ACP for new connects, all of which driving your version to mobile-only back to pre-pandemic levels. That broadband market growth rate overall we still saw is significantly reduced for all those factors inside of Q1 but a dramatic drop, and so that put our performance in relative light given the overall market backdrop, a lot of which was one time in nature. In Q2, and while it's early because we don't have all the data, I think our evidence shows that for the first time and due to, again, all of the one-time factors and most dramatically the loss of ACP, the broadband market actually shrunk as a one-time event. And so if you put our performance and then our statements about relative competition in context with that, and I think we're doing pretty well. And that was the nature of the comments that I provided in the prepared remarks. I do think that, as I mentioned, moves will come back. It's hard to predict exactly when, but moves will come back, housing starts will return, apartment rental rates will go back up, and most importantly, the most dramatic effect is once you flush out the ACP impact between Q2 and Q3 predominantly, then you'll be able to get back into a much more normalized environment. And I think the product investments that we're making and the attractiveness of the value that we provide puts us in great position for when that volume returns, and we're doing everything we can in the meantime to preserve all the ACP customers doing really well, but at the same time making sure that we're ready to come out in a good light on the back end once the volume does pick back up. Hey, Ben. So there's kind of three parts to that, which is, I'll start with the second one you had, is the Q3 ACP. I'll handle that. And Jessica can comment on bad debt and then cost reductions. Jessica can go through and I can tag team there a bit. But from a Q3 ACP outlook, we're not going to be providing any customer net additions guidance today, but for sure there's going to be, as we both mentioned, I think Jessica and I, that there'll be more non-pay disconnect in the third quarter. But there are a lot of other moving parts and we're competing well. I think that maybe the interesting tidbit here is maybe talking a little bit more about recent trends. June was oddly the best loss of the second quarter. And internet net ads trends in July have been similar to what we saw in June. Sounds great. But the reality is the ACP related non-pay disconnect activity hasn't started yet. And we'll know really more about sustainable payment trends than nothing to be scared of today, but sustainable payment trends really through August with the non-pay beginning then and trailing into a little bit into Q4. So when you step back, I know you know this, but ultimately this ACP transitions are onetime event. And so we're very focused on really isolating the ACP impact internally and evaluating not only obviously our performance on retaining those customers because we want to keep them connected. We think it's very valuable and we can, but also what's the underlying trend absent the ACP impact to make sure that we're getting better every day. So Jessica on the ACP does bad debt piece. And on the cost if you just take one a different layer of look, the, so Jessica's right, we're doing lots on vendor savings, overheads, organizational effectiveness lower growth environment, all that's true, but just want to make sure everybody understands that the key focus for us in terms of real permanent lasting and accelerating cost reduction is just to be a better service operator. So continue to invest in our frontline, have better tools, process and systems to make the investments that we've made in tenure. And we see that, and so we are having real results from some of the one time and permanent cost reductions, but we're also probably having bigger success on reducing the amount of service calls, reducing our truck roles, increasing the quality of the service that we provide, that's where the money's at. And then when you think about operating leverage, which is a term that you've used before the best way to have a better operating leverage is to have more customers and to have more products per household and have higher revenue. And that way you can, together, being a better service operator and having higher penetration of your products, you actually lower your cost to serve per customer, you lower your cost of capital per customer as well and you become a better cash flow operator. So all of those things still hold true. And it's why, when we talk about expense management, that we talk about really not doing anything that would impact sales or service, because that's the true efficiency opportunity and that's the opportunity to deliver long-term free cash flow and our views on that and our frontline hasn't changed at all. Sure. On the first one, Jessica, the DTC take-up is going very well. The first one, I know a lot of people think about Disney deals in September, but we launched I think late in January on Disney Plus Basic and it's going well and it's growing every month. We're adding some additional features into it, which will be helpful to even further accelerate the monthly growth that we see. That includes, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, the addition of the Disney Plus Premium as an incremental add-on. That will be coming soon, as well as the Disney Duo Basic bundle of plus $2 for Hulu. So that allows you to have a comprehensive package the same way that exists inside of retail and that's helpful, it was always the design. But there's complexity in terms of implementing all of this, also because some of the authentication principles that vary between different operators in terms of credentials and TV everywhere and whatnot. But it's going well and accelerating, ESPN Plus, I didn't mention that on the call, it's also having very good take-up, it's high value into our RSN packages, it's a small portion of the base, but the penetration is going well. And Paramount Plus will launch soon and ViX we just launched and we've always had Max and so that has existed already within the TV everywhere authenticated universe and our expectation is over the next year or so that we'll have a fully baked set of products which really what we're working towards and the more scale we get there the more effective it's going to be. We're not sitting here saying that we're going to arrest completely the loss of video but I think what we are saying is to the extent we're going to put video on our broadband bill, it better have value and if it doesn't have value to the customer then we'd rather they just go take that through the direct-to-consumer applications and we need to be proud of what we're putting on the bill and that's not where the MVPD space has been in a long time as we see a path to being able to be proud of what we're putting on the broadband bill as a video product that it may be expensive but it has a significant amount of value and using that to drive the converge connectivity relationships. So while it may not be growing it's still really important and I think it can be very valuable to our converge connectivity relationships. In terms of what's up next, we're not going to go give a programming renewal schedule but we're optimistic that this has been adopted both from an understanding that the DTCs really do need to be included as part of the full video package. And that's actually better for programmers because of reduced churn and upsell opportunities into the ad-free versions of these products as well. And that look, at the end of the day, if a customer can go out and get the same product at a cheaper price in the marketplace, I think they should. I don't think we should ask them to pay more through us. And so those are some of the core principles that we've had. I'm not committing, but those are some of the bigger ones. And political advertising it's always, as you know, it's always a jump ball as to exactly where it's going to go. And it's evaluated on a state-by-state basis. And so you can't really say that it's an -- it's the same nationally everywhere. So it depends on some of the swing states. Admittedly the events of the past week have jumbled what you thought that might look like. And certainly when you take a look at fundraising and the volatility in what could be swing states, it looks like political advertising net-net nationally is going to be higher than what it probably would have been just a 10 days ago. But it doesn't mean it happens necessarily in the right states for us. And so we're keeping an eye on that. And it's nice when it happens, but it's one time in nature. And so that's why we always try to talk about our results with and without the impacts of political advertising. Because what is this year's windfall will be next year's headwind. And we want to make sure everybody's focused on the right thing, which is the underlying growth profile of the subscription business. Which includes the core advertising, which continues to do well with or without political advertising. Sure. Well, look, once upon a time there wasn't an ACP, but it's been a long time. When you think about, we had the, during the pandemic we had the, we were a big participant in the remote education offer, the Keep Americans Connected, the EBB, which evolved and became the Emergency Broadband Benefit, which evolved and became the ACP. And we've been a significant participant in all of those, as has the industry. I think we all have a lot to be proud of for stepping up and really driving those programs, but they didn't exist before. And broadband is a really important product. And from a charter perspective, we have ways to continue to address that marketplace. Before I go there, you asked about the market level activity. I do think that in an environment where ACP or an equivalent doesn't exist, that by definition you have more customers coming in and out of broadband based on affordability. That's rise up transaction volume, both from a non-pay disconnect, as well as from a gross ad sales perspective. When you have better products and better price, that can work towards your advantage. So it's not all bad from our perspective. And but we also have the ability to, at acquisition and for retention, offer unique products. Our Internet 100 is attractively priced. It's not for everybody, but it's affordable. We also, and you can pair that together with Spectrum One, so the ability to have a free mobile line for the first year, and then that line rolls to $30 after a year. If you think about a typical one-line environment or even in a typical two-line environment, the average cost of a line is over $60. And so even at retail rate of $30, we've built in a savings of $30 per month through taking mobile together with our attractively priced, high-powered broadband product. And that's as much, if not more, than the ACP benefit, which means that if you take our products, we can effectively -- we have the built -in ACP savings available to you when you really take full advantage of our product set. And so that is a product and a combination that didn't fully exist prior to all of these programs. And I think we can, by having a wider availability for low income population of these broadband offers, which we have together with our Spectrum 1 offer combined, I think we can save customers as much if not more than they were they're getting through ACP relative to the past. So I think we're in good position to be able to address the base. But the market activity, for sure, is going to be higher than what has been the past couple of years. Thanks, everyone."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to our customer results on slide 6. Including residential and SMB, we lost 149,000 Internet customers in the second quarter. While in Mobile, we added 557,000 mobile lines. Video customers declined by 408,000 and wireline voice customers declined by 280,000. As Chris mentioned, our second quarter Internet losses were primarily driven by the end of the ACP program. ACP program connects ended in early February. In May, the program's original $30 subsidy was reduced to $14. And in June, that subsidy was reduced to zero. We estimate that the end of the program's impact on our second quarter internet gross additions and churn drove over 100,000 of our 149,000 internet losses in the quarter. And from a financial perspective, there was an approximately $30 million headwind to second quarter revenue from onetime non-recurring ACP related items in the quarter. In addition, similar to the end of the Keep Americans Connected program in June 2020, many of our ACP customers had past due balances that had been fully reserved for accounting purposes. We took steps to eliminate a portion of those back balances for certain customers and put a portion of their remaining balances on payment plans. For certain customers with a low likelihood to pay post ACP, we have been recognizing revenue on a cash basis, resulting in slightly less revenue and less bad debt in the second quarter than we would have otherwise had. So far, we are performing well with ACP retention, but the largest driver of Internet customer losses associated with the end of the ACP program will be in non-pay disconnects, and they will occur in the third and fourth quarters, likely weighted to the third. We continue to do everything we can to preserve connectivity for former ACP subsidy recipients. We have a number of products and offers to assist those that have lost their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program, our Internet 100 products, and we've been offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for one year. And we continue to market offers targeted at low income customers, a segment that we have historically served well. Turning to rural, we ended the quarter with 582,000 subsidized rural passings. We grew those passings by 89,000 in the second quarter and by 345,000 over the last 12 months. We had 36,000 net customer additions in our subsidized rural footprint in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2023, about 50% more than 2023. We also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, two years ahead of schedule. Moving to second quarter financial results starting on slide 7. Over the last year, Residential customers declined by 1.3%. Residential revenue per customer relationship grew by 0.4% year-over-year, given promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments, and the growth of Spectrum Mobile, partly offset by a higher mix of non-video customers, growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, and some internet ARPU compression related to retention offers extended to customers that previously received an ACP subsidy. As slide 7 shows, in total, Residential revenue declined by 0.6% year-over-year. Turning to commercial, SMB revenue grew by 0.6% year-over-year, reflecting SMB customer growth of 0.2% year-over-year and higher monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer, primarily due to rate adjustment. Enterprise revenue grew 4.5% year-over-year, driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.1% year-over-year. And when excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise grew by 5.9%. Second quarter advertising revenue grew by 3.3% year-over-year, given political revenue growth. Core ad revenue was down about 2% year-over-year. Other revenue grew by 6% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated second quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year and 0.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising revenue. Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on slide 8, in the second quarter, total operating expenses declined by 1.4% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 9.8% year-over-year due to a 9.5% decline in video customers year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages, partly offset by higher programming rates. Other costs of revenue increased by 12.6%, primarily driven by mobile service direct costs and higher mobile device sales. Cost-to-service customers declined 4.2% year-over-year given productivity from our 10-year investments, including lower labor costs and lower bad debt expense, as we saw some favorability and our mobile bad debt as a portion of revenue due to an improved customer tenure and credit profile. And, as I mentioned earlier, a portion of our uncollectible billings offset revenue in the quarter. Sales and marketing costs grew by 1.9% as we remain focused on driving customer acquisition. Finally, other expense grew by 4.7%, mostly driven by an insurance expense benefit from the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.6% year-over-year in the quarter, and when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.4% year-over-year. While we don't manage the business at a single product line P&L level, we continue to compute allocations internally, and this quarter, for the first time, our standalone mobile adjusted EBITDA was positive, even when including the headwind of subscriber acquisition costs and without the benefit of GAAP revenue allocation to mobile revenue. Our mobile profitability this quarter marks a significant milestone. It shows that we're on the path to establishing a mobile business that is very profitable. Overall, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can continue to do that even as we make significant investments in the business and face a challenging competitive environment and the end of the ACP program. Our expense management process is working with growing realization of impacts in the second quarter. We continue to expect accelerating EBITDA growth in the back half of the year, given our expense management initiatives, Spectrum 1 promotional roll-off, and political advertising revenue. Turning to net income on slide 9, we generated $1.2 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the second quarter, in line with last year, as higher adjusted EBITDA was mostly offset by higher other operating expense, primarily due to restructuring and severance costs and net amounts of litigation settlements. Turning to slide 10, capital expenditures totaled $2.85 billion in the second quarter, in line with last year's second quarter spend. Line extension spend totaled $1.1 billion, $37 million higher than last year, driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and continued network expansion across residential and commercial green sales and market fill-in opportunity. Second quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.7 billion, which was similar to the prior year period. For the full year 2024, we now expect capital expenditures to total approximately $12 billion, down from between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion previously. Our reduced outlook for 2024 capital spending reflects lower internet and video customer net additions, including the impact of the end of the ACP program, which drives lower CPE costs. We're also actively managing vendor rates and construction materials to make our capital expenditures more efficient. We still expect line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion, and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. Turning to free cash flow on slide 11, free cash flow in the second quarter totaled $1.3 billion, an increase of approximately $630 million compared to last year's second quarter. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by higher adjusted EBITDA, lower cash taxes due to timing, and a favorable change in working capital. On that front, we've been managing the balance sheet to provide us better overall cash flow and increased flexibility. Over the last several quarters, we sold our towers portfolio, which generated almost $400 million in proceeds. We launched our EIP securitization program in the second quarter, which backs a new $1.25 billion credit facility at favorable interest rates. And we've been working with our vendor base to extend our payment terms, utilizing a supply chain financing tool to support our working capital favorability. We will continue to identify and capitalize on balance sheet opportunities to help fund our unique one-time capital investments. We finished the quarter with $96.5 billion in debt principle. Our current rent rate annualized cash interest is $5.1 billion, and we repurchased $1.5 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units, totaling $404 million at an average price of $271 per share. Given our long dated and 86% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our rent rate interest expense would be less than $60 million. As of the end of the second quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12 months adjusted EBITDA moved down to 4.32x. We expect to continue to move closer to the middle of our 4x to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year. And we remain fully committed to maintaining our split rated debt structure, including access to the investment grade market, given the significant benefits that it offers to all of our capital providers. We continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We have the best products at the best prices in our industry, and we remain under penetrated relative to our long-term potential. That combined with the investments that we're making in the business and our expense savings initiative will continue to drive strong EBITDA growth and value creation for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. So Internet ARPU increased 1.7% year-over-year in the quarter. If you adjusted, Craig, for the $30 million in one-time ACP related items that I mentioned and for the impact of the mobile revenue allocation, that ARPU growth would have been 2.7%. I didn't incorporate the cash basis accounting impact that I mentioned earlier. It's small, and unless those customers do end up paying at a rate that's higher than our expectation, I think it recurs in revenue going forward. But so I think you would have been, but for those two items, that's a 2.7% On the free cash flow side, Jonathan, so I think we had previously talked about working capital for the year, coming back to being in a place that was relatively flat. As I said, we're working on the balance sheet and trying to make sure we can extract appropriate cash from the balance sheet to support what we're doing across the business. I think that we'll probably do better than that sort of flat working capital expectation, but I'm not prepared to say by exactly how much. The variability in working capital has a lot to do with exactly how expense timing and capital timing lands over the course of the year, and so while I think that we'll get good benefits out of just the balance sheet management side, I'm not going to take up the total thoughts that we've had on working capital today. On your other question, sort of how do we think about, I think it was sort of a one and then the other. Do you have to get all the way back to the middle of your range before you accelerate buybacks? I'm in the same place that I was last quarter, which is that I think that we can continue to do buybacks over the course of the rest of the year and still do what we have said that we would do from a leverage perspective. And I don't think of it as do you have to do one and then the other. I'm pretty confident in the trajectory of the business for the second half of the year. And so, I think that we can have sort of good pacing on buybacks and meet what we've said about leverage at the same time. That being said, the capital allocation strategy hasn't changed. We still go after high ROI, organic investment first. We still look then at whether there's a creative M&A opportunity is next. And those come before sort of this balance sheet management and share buybacks that happens as the last set of priorities there. And so, we haven't given a guide around where we think that we'll go in terms of total buybacks. It's because we want to make sure that we maintain that flexibility to do what we think is most important for the business, which is to make the right investments to drive growth of the business going forward. Yes. So if you think about what happened in bad debt in the year-over-year, Ben, there's a few things going on. One really with tenure and credit profile in our mobile customer base that's been improving, particularly for customers that have EIP plans with us. And on the ACP front, we took a lot of bad debt along the way, particularly for customers who entered the ACP program and they had outstanding unpaid balances. And so those have really been reserved throughout the ACP program. I mentioned it in the remarks but there also is a portion of the ACP customer base where we have a very low expectation of payment for them and so instead of taking their revenue into revenue and then taking bad debt expenses and offset, we actually didn't recognize revenue for those customers. So when you see that it means that bad debt expense, I think absent that you might have had -- you would have had more bad debt expense if we had put that back in the other direction. And then the last point I mean we did have overall lower resi revenue in 2Q in the year-over-year and some mixed changes and so with other things being equal that also drives a little bit of downward pressure on bad debt. All of that is to say I wouldn't read anything sort of into what is it that you think about Q3 and looking at what happened with bad debt in the year-over-year, I think there are a number of factors going on there. As you think about then what's happening on the overall cost reduction side which I think was your other question. The expense management process is pretty extensive. While we're not doing anything that will impact our sales or service capabilities, we have things that are big things that are small some short some medium some long-term opportunities all across the business. We've made progress with some vendor cost reductions with reduced spend around discretionary categories like real estate and third-party services, some reductions to overhead expenses and implementing some tools to increase our efficiency and actually I think the benefits from those came a little faster into 2Q than what we had anticipated, but we're already realizing the benefits of some of the changes will continue to build on additional opportunities over time. As you look at the rest of the year, I think we had given some thoughts on our outlook for expenses. We had expected programming costs per video customer to grow in the 1% to 2% range year-over-year. I now expect that to be flattish year-over-year. We previously had said that we expected costs to serve to be flat with 2023. I now expect that to decline by 1% to 2% inclusive of bad debt expense. And in sales to marketing, I think we had said 2% to 3% growth. And at this point, I would expect us to be in the low end of that range, if not a bit below. I also, as an aside, just want to clarify something I said earlier. My comments on working capital. I want to be clear that the comments on working capital are on cable working capital. Mobile continues to have the detriment of the EIP notes. And so those will continue to be a drag, though the securitization plan that we did in the quarter does help that."

Despite lower Internet sales, we added nearly 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.3 million lines year-over-year. We now have more than 8.2 million total mobile lines. With still low mobile penetration of Internet customers and passings, we have a long runway for customer and financial growth with the nation's fastest mobile service at incredible value.  \n Revenue was relatively flat in the quarter while adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.8%. And during the first quarter, our Internet customer growth remained challenged by a low-move and generally low-activity environment coupled with continued elevated competition at least in the short term and a small impact from fewer low-income connects due to discontinued ACP availability. Churn remains at historically low levels. \n Telephone Internet continues to compete for gross additions and has expanded its addressable market within our footprint. And we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our Internet product is faster and it's more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. And the cell phone companies will face capacity challenges as customer bandwidth grows.  \n In the first quarter, wireline overbuild activity continued at a similar pace. And given the value of our converged products, we resisted chasing some less rational promotional offers from overbuilders.  \n As we move forward with our key strategic initiatives, we believe that our differentiated converged connectivity products with superior speeds, that save customers money, and a video product with increasing value and utility to customers, provide us with significant competitive advantages and a platform to grow customers, penetration, EBITDA and free cash flow over time.  \n In Internet, data usage continues to grow and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During the first quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 800 gigabytes per month. And we now offer 300-meg, 500-meg and 1-gig symmetrical speeds in our first high split market.  \n Later this year, we'll begin launching the next wave of markets with distributed access architecture technology. When completed, we'll be able -- we'll be capable of offering 5 by 1 gigabit per second speeds in these markets with even better network performance. The next phase of markets will be upgraded to 10 by 1 gigabit per second speed and the ability to offer fiber on demand. \n And ultimately, we'll see lower contact rates and truck rolls across these upgraded markets, achieving both lower cost and a superior product.  We expect to complete our network evolution initiative in 2026, all at an incremental cost to just over -- or just $100 per passing, excluding the benefit of operating and capital savings that result from the project.  \n Our mobile offering also continues to evolve and improve. Earlier this month, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to customers within our Unlimited Plus offering. Anytime Upgrade allows new and existing Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements. We are the first mobile provider to include this level of freedom within a rate plan. And we also recently launched a new repair-and-replacement plan for just $5 per month. Anytime Upgrade, part of Unlimited Plus, and our repair-and-replacement plan, are each profitable.  \n Spectrum One continues to perform well beyond its first anniversary and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like mobile speed boost and seamless connectivity to the Spectrum Mobile network across Android and iOS devices. \n We still have a lot of room to grow our mobile business. Today, less than 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of Internet and mobile. We remain underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market-leading pricing at promotion and retail. And from a dollars perspective, we captured less than 30% share of residential mobile and Internet dollars spent in our footprint today. Mobile will be a meaningful driver of EBITDA and cash flow going forward with what is still an untapped ability to drive overall customer relationship growth.  \n Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product. We now offer a unique modern user experience with Xumo, which offers both linear and direct-to-consumer content on one device, combined with packaging and pricing options that offer choice, value and utility across FAST, SVOD, direct-to-consumer apps and linear video services.  \n In January, Disney+ became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost, with ESPN+ launched to Select Plus customers in March. ViX, a Spanish language DTC product, and regional sports DTC products, will also be available to customers at no extra cost within their respective packages.  \n We expect our hybrid DTC-linear model to be fully deployed next year. And we'll be able to deliver value for our customers and programming partners through fully bundled hybrid services, genre-based packages, selling DTC a la carte and potentially bundled DTC services to our broadband customers.  \n In late January, we launched our Spectrum TV Stream package, a 90-channel non-sports general entertainment package priced at $40 per month. TV Stream provides a compelling content offering at an attractive price from programmers like Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, Fox and A&E.  \n And so while the video business is clearly under pressure, we believe that flexible and attractively priced packaging options across all forms of video, channels really, integrated within a modern user interface in a more frictionless environment can recreate value in the ecosystem for our customers, programmers and distributors.  \n So when we step back, we clearly recognized some short-term market challenges, and we've embraced the opportunity to become an even better operator, leaving no stone unturned in our go-to-market and our efficiency initiatives. And in the meantime, we're growing a unique converged product at a rapid pace which can grow EBITDA through a competitive investment cycle. In long term, our network and customer demand products, pricing and packaging capabilities, our service infrastructure and the associated investments we're making today position Charter for sustainable growth and value creation.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. \nJessica Fischer: Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we lost 72,000 Internet customers in the first quarter, and video customers declined by 405,000. In mobile, we added 486,000 mobile lines. And wireline voice customers declined by 279,000. Our mobile product continued to perform well. And although we saw lower mobile gross adds year-over-year tied to lower gross Internet additions, we also saw lower overall mobile churn rate year-over-year and sequentially.  \n Customers who signed up for our Spectrum One product in the first quarter of 2023 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Similar to last quarter, those promotional roll-offs did not drive incremental Internet churn. In fact, our Internet churn rate also declined year-over-year. So as we always expected, Spectrum One lines are performing well, and our converged offering drives higher mobile sales and longer customer lifetimes.  \n Turning to rural. We ended the quarter with 493,000 subsidized rural passings. And we grew those passings by 324,000 over the last 12 months and 73,000 in the first quarter. It's a bit of a slowdown from Q4, as we noted it would be on our last call, given winter construction seasonality. Penetration growth continues to exceed our expectations, and customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint increased with 35,000 net customer additions in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024, about 50% more than in 2023. \n We also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, 2 years ahead of schedule. The RDOF and ARPA program rules have been successful in driving large-scale private capital builds. With respect to BEAD, most of the state's rules are still working through the NTIA review process. We expect some states will have a regulatory environment conducive to private investment while others will not. And we'll be disciplined in our investment approach with the continued expectation that some opportunities with appropriate ROIs will be available.  \n Before turning to our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program. An ACP renewal now appears unlikely for the program's 23 million recipients nationwide and for our 5.0 million Internet customers receiving a subsidy. We will do everything we can to preserve our relationship with the ACP subsidy recipients, and we expect to keep the vast majority of them as customers. We have a number of ways to assist those that may lose their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program and Internet 100 product. We're also offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for 1 year.  \n The success of our Spectrum One offering has shown that we can create long-term converged connectivity customers by saving consumers hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their mobile bill. And even after the initial promotional period ends, we will still be able to save these customers the equivalent or more than the $30 ACP subsidy benefit that they are currently receiving.  \n The majority of ACP recipients in our customer base were Internet customers before the start of the ACP program. And the vast majority of our ACP customers also pay something out of pocket for their Internet service. Ultimately, we will lose some customers, and our Internet ARPU and bad debt expense may have onetime pressure, but we expect the impact to Charter to be mostly limited to the second and third quarters of this year. And we will provide transparency for those impacts in our quarterly reporting.  \n Moving to the first quarter financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.7%, driven by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined 0.1% over-year, given a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, mostly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile. As Slide 6 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.4% year-over-year.  \n Turning to commercial. SMB revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were slightly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.2% year-over-year.  \n Enterprise revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.5%.  \n First quarter advertising revenue grew by 10% year-over-year given political revenue growth. And core ad revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. \n Other revenue grew by 2.4% year-over-year primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year and down 0.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising. \n Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses declined by 1.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 8.2% year-over-year due to the decline in video customers of 8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. And first quarter 2024 programming costs include around $30 million of favorable adjustments versus $50 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year period. \n Other cost of revenue increased by 9.8% primarily driven by mobile service direct costs and higher mobile device sales. Cost to serve customers were essentially flat year-over-year with additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile and higher bad debt expense, mostly offset by lower service transactions per customers, including productivity from 10-year investments. Sales and marketing costs declined by 2.7% primarily driven by lower labor costs, partly tied to lower connect volume. Finally, other expense grew by 0.5%. \n Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.8% year-over-year in the quarter. And when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.2% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can do that even as we make significant investments in the business, face a challenging competitive environment and reach the likely end of the ACP program. \n Our residential revenue will be supported by Internet ARPU growth and our growing mobile customer base. In addition, mobile's contribution to EBITDA continues to improve as the business scales. We've also lapped the significant investments that we made in our employee base, so the related EBITDA drag should be mostly behind us. \n And finally, we continue to carefully manage our expenses across the business. And while we're not going to do anything that would impact our sales or service capabilities, this quarter's cost to service customers and sales and marketing expense results demonstrate our ability to drive efficiencies into the business. \n In the second quarter, we will face some tough expense comparisons, particularly in other expense as well as ACP headwinds. So while our second quarter EBITDA growth will be muted, our expense management process is clearly working. And financial growth in the back half of the year should accelerate given our expense management initiatives, Spectrum One promotional roll-off and political advertising revenue. \n Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, up from $1 billion last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on the sale of towers, partly offset by higher income tax and interest expenses. \n Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.8 billion in the first quarter, about $325 million above last year's first quarter spend. Line extensions totaled $1 billion, $69 million higher than last year driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities. \n First quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023 driven by higher spend on upgrade, rebuild, primarily network evolution, and higher CPE spend due to purchases of Xumo Stream boxes. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. \n Turning to free cash flow on Slide 10. The cash flow in the first quarter totaled $358 million, a decrease of approximately $300 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures and a onetime settlement payment in the first quarter of 2024, partly offset by a less unfavorable change in working capital year-over-year and higher adjusted EBITDA. \n We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 85% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $140 million. \n As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.41x, which is lower sequentially and year-over-year. We expect to continue that trend, moving closer to the middle of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year. \n We remain fully committed to maintaining our split-rated debt structure, including access to the investment-grade market given the significant benefits it offers to all of our providers of capital. And we continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We believe that our levered equity strategy, including share buybacks, combined with the investments that we are making in the business, will drive value going forward. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $567 million at an average price of $339 per share. \n With the continued temporary impact from cell phone Internet competition and the potential headwind from the end of ACP, we will continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds. Despite these short-term challenges, we are competing well. We have a very attractively structured balance sheet, and we're focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024 through a short-term competitive and investment cycle. So we're well positioned today and for continued future growth. \n With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik from UBS. \nJohn Hodulik: If I could follow up on the ACP comments, first of all, just any additional color you guys can provide over the -- on the subscriber and ARPU impacts to that program winding down in the second and third quarter. And it sounds like given the cost-cutting opportunities and the commentary, you still believe you can grow EBITDA for the year. That's number one. \n And then number two, I thought the commentary about the churn on the video side from the Disney renewal was interesting. Chris, is that a trend that you expect to continue, especially as you sort of roll over your existing or you go through more renewals and add more D2C services to your lineup? \nChristopher Winfrey: Sure. Let me try to tackle those, and Jessica may want to chime in here as well. The first one is on ACP and what we estimate. John, the non-renewal of ACP, there's 23 million customers have it today. It's unfortunate. But it's certainly going to have a negative Internet customer growth impact for everyone, including us. And that's going to happen in what's already a seasonal Q2 and probably the third quarter as we work through likely non-pay activity. And so really, as you think about the extent of those losses, it's going to depend on a few things. \n One, first, being the stickiness of our retention offers. That includes us doing a free mobile line as well as for all ACP customers. That allows customers to save as much, if not more money on a monthly basis than the subsidy we already offered by ACP. In some cases, it can be much closer to EBB or maybe even more. \n And we do have a Spectrum Internet Assist. We have Internet 100. So we have products that we can move people to as needed. And so the second thing I would say is it's going to depend on how well we really execute on those retention tactics that matters. And then thirdly, the way that we manage what's going to be likely an elevated non-pay environment and really managing that to the best of our ability for the benefit of customers. \n In terms of specifics, this is an event that's unprecedented. In almost 30 years of cable, I haven't seen something like this before. So the short-term impact, it's difficult to predict. But in the end, I'm really confident we're going to manage through it successfully. It will be a onetime event, both on subscribers and maybe initial suppression of ARPU, but it's not going to impact our long-term growth potential. \nJessica Fischer: Yes. As you think about EBITDA across the year, as we pointed out and I would just highlight it, there are some pressures on EBITDA in Q2 because of the comps to last year as well as likely, if there is non-pay impact, there could be some bad debt pressure inside of Q2 as well. So I would expect our EBITDA growth to be more pressured in Q2. \n But we see the ability for it to accelerate across the rest of the year when you consider the roll-off of Spectrum Mobile, political advertising and our continued expense initiatives in the business as well. And so because of that, in all of the scenarios that we've looked at, we continue to expect EBITDA growth in the year. \nChristopher Winfrey: Yes. And so EBITDA, we're very confident on that. Giving a hard estimate on subscriber impact, for all the reasons I mentioned, is difficult. But we're going to outline that quarter by quarter. We'll have the ability to isolate. We'll provide that transparency for people along so they can see what's the underlying growth rate. \n Your other question, John, I want to make sure I understand, was on video churn. We rolled out -- at the beginning of the quarter, we rolled out the Disney+ to all Spectrum Select customers and above and to Select Plus customers, which is our more sports-oriented package on top. We rolled out ESPN+ in March. Very early on, good take-up on that product along the way. But there was nothing that was a rotation of our subscriber base inside there. So there was not a negative contributing factor to adding those in. \n I would highlight, in an environment where video these days really is coming in as an attach rate to Internet, we have lower Internet sales opportunities that has an impact on video. So the video churn rate stays relatively consistent. But the combination of having both lower selling opportunities for Internet and therefore lower attach rates for video, combined with the fact that we did do a programming cost increase pass-through inside of Q1 contributed to the video loss inside the quarter. \n I do think that as we add more bundling of these DTCs in a hybrid linear model over time, I think we have the ability to stem a lot of the churn and actually add back to both the gross addition side coming from potentially new calls coming in, but also higher attach rate to Internet primarily as we provide more value into the package, which offsets the significant programming cost increases that we've been forced to pass through. Does that answer where you're trying to get to? \nJohn Hodulik: Yes, that's perfect. \nOperator: The next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Just maybe unpacking the EBITDA outlook a little bit more. Jessica, last quarter, you gave us some helpful guidance on a few expense line items for the year. I think programming, cost to service and marketing come to mind. I don't know if you had any updates on any of those given some of the moving pieces. I just wanted to check on that. \n And then secondly, for either of you or both of you, just on broadband competition. Could you spend a minute just talking about sort of how you see your product competing right now with fixed wireless, which is sort of everywhere or in a lot of markets, and then the wireline overbuild piece? Because fixed wireless net adds at the industry level this quarter, or cell phone Internet just to stay on brand here, were down year-on-year and a bit lighter than at least we were expecting. So it does seem like that product is starting to mature here. But you also called out wireline overbuild sort of pricing at a discount in the market as well. So I'd love to hear your updated thoughts on sort of the competitive framework you're thinking about this year. \nJessica Fischer: So Ben, on the line item expense guidance that we gave earlier in the year, I don't have an update to any of those specific items. But what I would tell you is that, because of some of the work that we're doing around expenses across the business, I think it's possible that we come in lower than what we guided to, to begin with. I don't have a revision, but I think it's possible we come in on the low side. \nBenjamin Swinburne: Okay. Even with the bad debt comment you made earlier? \nJessica Fischer: So that's a fair call out. The exact amount of the bad debt related to ACP is hard to predict because it's a matter of what the mix is between customers that go non-pay and customers that sort of contact you in some other way. So that's fair call out. \n On items other than that, I think the possibility is that we do better. \nChristopher Winfrey: You've got a lower transaction environment, plus all the expense management activity that we're doing, and that will have significant impact to cost to serve as well as sales and marketing as well. \n And the broadband competition, maybe just take a step back and talk a little bit more detail about the operating environment and competitive and the results in that context. \n The first thing I think is important to just keep in mind is that our churn, it continues to be at or below historic lows, so very good. And bear with me, but we actually performed a little better in the first quarter in competitive switching versus last year. Which then somebody said, \"Well, wait a second, how does that work?\" \n And the real issue has been selling opportunities for broadband were actually much lower in the marketplace year-over-year, and that's driven by continued lower year-over-year move and household formation rates. There is some reversion to pre-pandemic mobile-only levels the past 2 quarters. \n And at the same time, as you mentioned, there's still some cell phone Internet expansion, and that's competing what is for a much lower opportunity set. So if you add to that, then just a bit of impact from the removal of ACP connects that started in early February, that's really what drove us to the loss of roughly 70,000 Internet. \n Ben, as you know, in this environment, small shifts in gross adds in particular, or even churn, which hasn't been the case, it just really has an outsized impact on net adds. And so that's going to definitely, as I mentioned before, it's going to be the case in the seasonal Q2, also with the end of ACP, all of which is temporary in nature. \n I think the bigger question is what are we doing? And as I mentioned, we still know, and I think everybody agrees, we have the best products. And we have it at the best all-in price, particularly when you're combining broadband and mobile, which is, in a lot of cases, what we're competing against. Our network evolution to symmetrical and multi-gig wireline and wireless capabilities, and we're doing that at a low cost of $100 per passing. And then as I mentioned, we have the expansion of that best-in-class network and converged products to homes with no broadband today. \n So in essence, what we're doing is we're still very competitive saving customers lots of money with fastest products. And we do that with a 100% in-house onshore service structure. And when you put that together with what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is continued increasing customer demand for data, it means we're very well positioned to return to sustainable growth over time. \n And the key for us really is, in the meantime, we're heads down on execution. It doesn't mean that we don't have short-term opportunities. We're leaving no stone unturned on go-to-market. We have great assets and ability to package and price in I think ways that are new and innovative. \n And what we're trying to do in the meantime as well, you mentioned on wireline overbuild in particular, still be very disciplined around the pricing because we know the value of our products. And so we saw a few overbuilders go a little bit downstream during the quarter. And we've resisted the temptation to go there just because we know the value of our both wireline and wireless services and the value that we can bring to customers long term. \nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin at New Street. \nJonathan Chaplin: I guess the first one for Jessica, just on the change in your leverage target navigating towards the midpoint of the range. Would love to just get some more context on the thinking behind that. You sort of mentioned earlier in the script that the risk of higher rates isn't a material concern. And so this navigating down in the leverage range just reflect lower confidence in the cash -- the sort of the cash generation in the business given the competitive environment? \nJessica Fischer: Yes. So Jonathan, I would say our confidence in the business hasn't changed. We remain comfortable with our 4 to 4.5x range based on the outlook that we have. But I think being sort of at the height of the investment cycle, we thought that creating a little bit of headroom was appropriate. \n We constantly reevaluate our position. We'll continue to do that. But we continue to believe in the long-term trajectory of the business. We think the investments that we're making will deliver strong returns. And we know that maintaining the levered equity strategy, including sort of buybacks and leverage levels overall, is important to continuing to drive value. \nChristopher Winfrey: I would just add on -- just to add, Jessica said it, 0 lack of confidence. We have good, strong free cash flow today, have even growing free cash flow, and much more so as we get through these onetime investments. It's really -- as Jessica has already said, it's about making sure that we ensure the investment-grade structure we have. And that's important to us, it's important to our debt holders, and it's important to our equity holders as well. \nJonathan Chaplin: And Chris, just a follow-up on that. Were the rating agencies sort of asking you to bring leverage lower in the range? And are there things that you could look -- that we could look for in the business that would make you feel comfortable to go back to the high end of the range over the course of the next few quarters? \nJessica Fischer: Jonathan, we're in regular contact with all 3 of the ratings agencies. Certainly, I think that there has been some additional conversation across debt holders and the rating agencies, given the higher CapEx that we have in the business and the sort of short-term pressure that, that puts on free cash flow. \n And given sort of the tone of the broader market, you might have seen S&P issued a tearsheet at the end of last week that addressed ACP and the competitive environment. And I think their concerns are similar to those of equity holders, though they noted in there that they don't expect our ratings to change even though they might adjust their triggers somewhat. And even if our corporate family ratings were to change, they didn't expect any impact to the investment-grade rating. \n So we constantly communicate with them. I think that given where we are, it made sense for us to create a little bit of headroom. As I said, we constantly reevaluate. It's certainly possible that we could move back up in the range at some point in time, particularly as you think about sort of free cash flow growth coming back as the investments winds down. \nChristopher Winfrey: And so I'd put that one to being responsive, and at the same time, given the current stock price, we want to do as much as we can within that responsiveness. \nJessica Fischer: Yes. \nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson. \nCraig Moffett: Chris, I want to -- maybe 2 questions. One broader sort of more strategic question and then just one clarification from Jessica. On the first one, you said something to me a while back that I've been thinking about, about the way you think about convergence. And you characterized the Spectrum One offer not really as an offer but sort of as a new product category. \n I wonder if you could just talk about that a little bit and particularly in the context of AT&T talking quite frequently about their converged offering in the portion of their footprint where they have it. T-Mobile now with their Lumos deal yesterday, obviously sort of searching around for a converged offering. How much of the market is actually going in that direction? \n And then, Jessica, just one minor clarification. Could you just let us know how much is left of wholesale in the business services market? So that we can understand when we might start to see the overall growth rate start to look more like the non-wholesale part of your business? \nChristopher Winfrey: So Craig, I'll start on the first one on convergence. And I think the best way to do this is I spend a lot of time internally talking about it as well, is if I asked you 15 years ago, what's the speed of your Internet connection? You would have connected to the back of the computer in your kitchen, and that would have been it. And 10 years ago, it might have been, here it is on WiFi on my couch or out on the terrace. \n And today, if you're pulling out of the driveway and driving out and I say, \"Who's your Internet provider right now?\" You'd say, \"I don't know, I don't care. It just has to work and it has to be fast.\" And if that's people's definition increasingly of what's broadband connectivity, then we're the only provider in our footprint that can provide that uniform, ubiquitous broadband Internet in a seamless connectivity way. \n And so we have the Internet. We have the WiFi. Our 5G cellular is a backup service when Internet and WiFi isn't available. And over -- last we reported, it was 87% of our traffic was going over our WiFi and increasingly with CBRS.\n So 5G, interestingly, it's the backup radio. It's the slowest portion of our network. And when you put that all together in a way that I think we're uniquely capable of doing, we have the ability to offer something in the marketplace. \n Now the challenge is that's not the way that it's been sold. It's not the way that customers think about it explicitly today in terms of how they purchase service. So there's an education challenge that's there in the way that we package, price and market that along the way. We'll have a meaningful impact. \n Another way of thinking about it is that mobile today, and in fact I would argue, always has been, is just an extension of an Internet connection. And is it really a product? Is mobile a product? Or is it just an extension? Because even in 15 years ago, it's really a wireline service going to a tower, and that was just extending the broadband connection. And today, we're doing that from WiFi inside the home, out on strand. And we have the ability to provide that service in a ubiquitous way that is competitive. \n And so Spectrum One, the idea is how do you educate the market and try to get the purchase habits to change in a different way. And over time, is mobile really a product? And testing and pushing the limits in the market, I think we have something here that's a competitive advantage, and it just may take a little bit of time to fully flesh its way out. \n But we are that service provider today, not only to ourselves, but we're actually providing that backhaul service to foreign cellular devices on our WiFi routers today. And we are the backhaul and the backbone of almost all cellular traffic. So it just puts a unique opportunity for us to capitalize on that in the future. \nJessica Fischer: Craig, on the other side, wholesale is a little less than 20% of overall enterprise revenues. \nChristopher Winfrey: And the piece of that, the piece that's pulling that is really cell tower backhaul... \nJessica Fischer: Yes, and that's really a little less than half of that piece. \nChristopher Winfrey: Right. So the traditional wholesale is relatively steady, and it's the cell tower backhaul that's in systemic decline, if you will. \nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Kraft: I had 2 if I could. First, Jessica, related to free cash flow. I was wondering if you could size for us the onetime payment in the first quarter that impacted free cash flow. And also if you could help us understand how you're thinking about working capital usage this year.\n And then, Chris, just on network neutrality. I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the SEC's recent reinstituting of net neutrality rules. Any concerns with the rules? Do they impact the way you're running the business in any way, whether it's on the home broadband or on mobile side? \nJessica Fischer: Yes. So Bryan, the onetime payment that impacted free cash flow on the order of $150 million to $180 million, in that range. And then from a working capital perspective, Q1 is always for us a negative working capital quarter. And I fully expect that we'll sort of make back to close to flat over the course of the year the negative working capital that we had. Excluding working capital, excluding the mobile device or the mobile side in the first quarter. Obviously, mobile continues to be a drag on working capital because of the device sales, and so you should expect that piece to continue. \nChristopher Winfrey: Bryan, on the net neutrality, I'd start from the get go. We don't -- the key concern isn't net neutrality. The concern is the Title II regime. We've -- we don't block. We don't do paid prioritization. We don't throttle, and we don't even have data caps. We believe that customers should have unlimited usage of the service that they're paying for. \n The question has really been around Title II and what that brings, things around forbearance on rate regulation, the additional unintended consequences of where that can lead to on regulation for a product that, without regulation, is that type of regulation has been very successful to delivering tremendous value for consumers over a couple of decades now. \n I would say that where we're at in the Title II debate with the FCC, there's 0 surprise. It's exactly where everybody thought we would be, and we're going to continue to go through that process. Unfortunately, it seems like over many years as this kind of works its way probably back to a court at this stage. And then hopefully, over time, we can get a standard set by Congress that puts this to bed once and for all. That's always been the hope. But I don't think Title II is the right way to regulate the things that we're already doing well. \nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Rollins at Citi. \nMichael Rollins: Two questions. First, with respect to the residential broadband ARPU performance, can you unpack the benefit in the quarter from the Spectrum One promotions rolling off? And how the potential benefit of this in terms of size can move through the year as more customers start getting back to maybe the normal course rate levels? \n And then just secondly, in the press release for quite some time now, you noted customers, and I hope I'm framing this right, that are broadband subscribers where there may have been some suspension of collections for other Charter services. And I'm curious what happens to those customers if ACP is discontinued? And do those disclosures provide any insight on how to quantify potential customer risk or churn risk if this program is discontinued? \nJessica Fischer: Yes. So starting on the first one on the Internet ARPU. The Spectrum One allocation was 70 basis points of drag year-over-year on our net ARPU growth in the quarter. So the GAAP Internet ARPU increased by 1.7%. It would have been 2.4% excluding the mobile allocation for free lines. Generally, I would expect that the gap in those 2 growth rates should narrow over the course of the year because the base of free lines becomes more stable given promotional roll-off. \n However, I talked about that we are offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for a year. And depending on the level of success of that program, if we did see a reacceleration in the number of free lines, the gap between those 2 things could widen again. \n Talking about what you see inside of the footnote and the aging. So we have had a process over time where we save customers into ACP. So if there was a customer who took multiple lines of business, say they were an Internet and video customer, and they were paying us. And then went into a non-pay status but they were eligible for ACP. \nChristopher Winfrey: Or in it, in most cases. \nJessica Fischer: Or already in ACP. What we would do would be to downgrade the customer to an Internet-only product that was fully covered by the ACP subsidy, which enabled them to continue their Internet service. But then they would no longer have whatever the additional services were that were on their accounts. We have held those balances, though they're fully reserved. So they're sitting in receivables, but they're also sort of fully written off already in the bad debt reserve process. \n But you're correct that numerically inside of the footnote, then you can see the base of customers who at some point in the past went into a non-pay process but have had their bill fully subsidized by ACP for some period of time. \nChristopher Winfrey: And if you think about it just from a customer perspective and how we were trying to be responsive to the government request, we wanted to make sure that these customers entering into collection cycle on video or phone didn't somehow suppress their ability to continue to receive the ACP benefit and continue to receive connectivity. And it's -- that's a classic example of the base of customers that we're going to work through, as I talked about from a collection cycle. And do the right thing for those customers to do everything we can to make sure that they stay connected to Internet over time. But there's challenges there. \nMichael Rollins: And are you choosing to implement the ACP wind-down at the end of April? Or are you planning to go through mid-May with your customers? \nChristopher Winfrey: We'll go through the month of May with a partial ACP in accordance with what the government outlined. It's going to be a partial credit of $14, and we've agreed to make it $15 just to round it and make it clear to -- and fair to customers. So that's what we'll do inside of May. \nOperator: The next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore. \nVijay Jayant: Chris, given your focus on improving the video consumer proposition, I think you have a pretty substantial programming contract coming up very shortly. And what [ you sort of saw ] with the Disney agreement. Can you just talk about, is there a big [ opportunity ] there to sort of resize your programming costs associated with that sort of portfolio of channels? \n And second, I saw that your buyback authorization is somewhere around the $260 million. Is that something that's going to be re-upped? \nChristopher Winfrey: So on the first question, the connection was a little off, and so we're going to sell you a Spectrum Mobile after this call here. \n But the -- so I'm going to want to take the liberty of answering the question I think you asked. Look, we don't get into detail on individual programming renewals, and we've been generally very successful at getting renewals throughout the years. That's always our goal. \n Our goal, though, is to really make sure that, first and foremost, that we really change the model so that we, once again, create value for customers. That starts with not asking them to pay twice for the same product, which is the debate that we've had historically and where we set a new model. \n But it also means approaching the marketplace in all of our deal renewals and saying, \"Look, we've got to fight for the customer.\" And if they have a path to get a product that's equivalent or in some cases, even better for a lower price, we should just be selling that product, and that's the way that we should go to market. \n And we can have that ability to do traditional linear hybrid. We can sell DTCs. We can sell them in a bundle. We have 25,000 in-house sales representatives in sales and retention. And so we have a workforce that's very capable of being a distribution engine for linear hybrid, DTC. And we have a large base of broadband customers, none surpassing us, that we can use that's unique. And we want to do that in a way that creates value for consumers. \n I think as we've approached the marketplace in what is a different way, it creates consternation because it's something very different. But our goal here is really to create a video ecosystem that works for customers and providing utility and value. Again, utility through Xumo and value through our ability to package in different ways that meets the customers' needs at a fair price. And ultimately, while it may be painful along the way, actually creates value again for programmers and distributors and recreates a video ecosystem that works for everybody. \n And so we're not approaching this from a way of just trying to save money. We're just trying to actually create value for customers by either adding more product so that the price they pay is worth it or saving them money because they wanted to package anyway. And we can do that in a way in a lower churn environment for the benefit of programmers, and that just takes a little bit to get through. \n But our goals here are really to recreate a video ecosystem that works for everybody. Today, it doesn't. It's been broken, and it's been broken for a while. And I think that we had the first time in maybe 2 decades where we can do something where we have a product that we're proud to put on our Internet bill at some point soon. \n And that really is, when we talked about it last year, is the balance of, on one hand, our bundled customers churn less. And so a high-quality video product has always been an asset. But when the rate continues to go up and the value goes down and it's being sold around customers and ask them to pay twice, then it becomes a liability on the Internet broadband bill. And then I think we need to rethink the way that what we're selling for video and how it actually creates value for customers or not. \n So that's where we've been. And I'm confident we're going to continue to make progress in this space. \nJessica Fischer: On the buyback authorization side. I'm going to make sure we answer that question. The authorization as of the end of the quarter, as you pointed out, is a little bit lower than what you would typically see. There are multiple mechanisms by which that gets renewed, and we have increased the buyback authorization since that point in time. And just because of the readthrough to that, I want to be really clear that we expect to be able to maintain our buybacks over the course of the year even as we delever. So you should not read that through as any sort of sign about the direction of the program. \nStefan Anninger: Operator, we'll take our last question, please. \nOperator: The last question will come from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. \nSteven Cahall: So Chris, earlier, you said you're confident in returning to long-term growth, and you spoke a lot about the overbuilding activity that you're seeing. I think the challenge many of us have is when we pencil that out and kind of think about penetration of fiber and then we look at your passings growth and think about penetration as well, it's just tough to see when things return to growth on the subscriber side, maybe ex rural. So I was wondering if you could just give us any thinking as to your color and timing when we might start to see subscriber growth reaccelerate to a positive level. \n And then Jessica, just picking up on Bryan's question. You talked about maybe mobile being a bit of drag in working capital this year. So as you start to do the ACP lines for mobile, could that accelerate the drag for mobile working capital on handsets? Or do you not expect the customers to necessarily be acquiring new handsets? \nChristopher Winfrey: So I'm not going to provide a detailed timeline for the timing to reaccelerate, just because I want to be conservative and recognize that it's a very fluid space. I mean, clearly, we have ACP going on right now, which is going to be a onetime hit. You have cell phone Internet where they will reach capacity, and the timing of that isn't entirely clear. And then there's fiber upgrades, which have been announced and are pretty far along from what was actually announced. \n So I think if you put that all together, though, and flip it and say, well, get past ACP, and the pace of fiber upgrades is relatively stable, and I think over time should actually start to decline. Cell phone Internet will run out of capacity, and you're already starting to see some signs of some of that paring back, all of which bodes well. \n And then you combine that with the fact that when you look at our -- the quality of our Internet product, in 100% of the market, particularly and even more so in those that don't have a gig overlap, which is about half. And then you combine that with the unique ability to provide a very attractively priced mobile product that's actually the fastest mobile product in the business simply because it largely rides on our gigabit wireless infrastructure, we have a structural advantage for now and many years to come, not only just on quality, but the ability to save customers hundreds and even thousands of dollars. \n And so I sit back and look at that and say, it isn't a question of if. It's just a question of when. And as some of these short-term pressures pare back, that's when you'll start to see it turn. \n Honestly, we haven't been the best at predicting the exact timing of that. And so I said last quarter, we owned that. And so I want to be careful that I'm not overextending ourselves here either. But I think it's more important just to take a step back and look at what is the product we have, what's the network capabilities we have. It's only getting better. \n If you then tack on to that the rural passings, that you mentioned ex rural, so I did that ex rural. But if you add on to that the subsidized rural passings where it's just math in terms of the penetration, the net additions that we're going to get on the back of that investment, I still think the future's very, very bright for Charter. \nJessica Fischer: On the mobile working capital side, so you point out, without a doubt, the drag on working capital is driven by the number of phones or other mobile devices that you sell subject to EIP notes. And so if we were to end up with additional devices because of having additional mobile customers as a result of our work on ACP or if we end up with some additional devices because of the Anytime Upgrade program, which is also possible, there could be some acceleration in that drag. \n What I would tell you on the other side of that is, as we've been building our mobile business, we haven't taken advantage of some of the financing options that are available for us related to having those EIP notes as part of our overall asset stack. And it hasn't yet made sense for a wide variety of reasons, including just sort of building the scale for a program like that to make sense. \n So I think it's also possible that we could offset some of that drag in working capital by working through some of those financing mechanisms. And certainly, as we've been building, I think we're reaching a size at which that becomes a more viable option. \nChristopher Winfrey: Good. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. And look forward to talking to you again on the next one. \nStefan Anninger: Thanks, operator.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Winfrey",
            "content": "Thanks, Stefan. During the first quarter, we lost 72,000 Internet customers. Despite lower Internet sales, we added nearly 500,000 Spectrum Mobile lines and close to 2.3 million lines year-over-year. We now have more than 8.2 million total mobile lines. With still low mobile penetration of Internet customers and passings, we have a long runway for customer and financial growth with the nation's fastest mobile service at incredible value.  \n Revenue was relatively flat in the quarter while adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.8%. And during the first quarter, our Internet customer growth remained challenged by a low-move and generally low-activity environment coupled with continued elevated competition at least in the short term and a small impact from fewer low-income connects due to discontinued ACP availability. Churn remains at historically low levels. \n Telephone Internet continues to compete for gross additions and has expanded its addressable market within our footprint. And we remain confident in our ability to return to healthy long-term growth. Our Internet product is faster and it's more reliable. Our pricing is lower when similarly bundled with mobile. And the cell phone companies will face capacity challenges as customer bandwidth grows.  \n In the first quarter, wireline overbuild activity continued at a similar pace. And given the value of our converged products, we resisted chasing some less rational promotional offers from overbuilders.  \n As we move forward with our key strategic initiatives, we believe that our differentiated converged connectivity products with superior speeds, that save customers money, and a video product with increasing value and utility to customers, provide us with significant competitive advantages and a platform to grow customers, penetration, EBITDA and free cash flow over time.  \n In Internet, data usage continues to grow and demand for faster speeds will grow with it. During the first quarter, Internet customers who do not buy traditional video from us use nearly 800 gigabytes per month. And we now offer 300-meg, 500-meg and 1-gig symmetrical speeds in our first high split market.  \n Later this year, we'll begin launching the next wave of markets with distributed access architecture technology. When completed, we'll be able -- we'll be capable of offering 5 by 1 gigabit per second speeds in these markets with even better network performance. The next phase of markets will be upgraded to 10 by 1 gigabit per second speed and the ability to offer fiber on demand. \n And ultimately, we'll see lower contact rates and truck rolls across these upgraded markets, achieving both lower cost and a superior product.  We expect to complete our network evolution initiative in 2026, all at an incremental cost to just over -- or just $100 per passing, excluding the benefit of operating and capital savings that result from the project.  \n Our mobile offering also continues to evolve and improve. Earlier this month, we began offering Anytime Upgrade to customers within our Unlimited Plus offering. Anytime Upgrade allows new and existing Unlimited Plus customers to upgrade their phones whenever they want, eliminating traditional wait times, upgrade fees and condition requirements. We are the first mobile provider to include this level of freedom within a rate plan. And we also recently launched a new repair-and-replacement plan for just $5 per month. Anytime Upgrade, part of Unlimited Plus, and our repair-and-replacement plan, are each profitable.  \n Spectrum One continues to perform well beyond its first anniversary and offers the fastest connectivity with differentiated features like mobile speed boost and seamless connectivity to the Spectrum Mobile network across Android and iOS devices. \n We still have a lot of room to grow our mobile business. Today, less than 8% of our total passings take our converged offering of Internet and mobile. We remain underpenetrated despite having a differentiated and superior offering with market-leading pricing at promotion and retail. And from a dollars perspective, we captured less than 30% share of residential mobile and Internet dollars spent in our footprint today. Mobile will be a meaningful driver of EBITDA and cash flow going forward with what is still an untapped ability to drive overall customer relationship growth.  \n Finally, turning to the evolution of our video product. We now offer a unique modern user experience with Xumo, which offers both linear and direct-to-consumer content on one device, combined with packaging and pricing options that offer choice, value and utility across FAST, SVOD, direct-to-consumer apps and linear video services.  \n In January, Disney+ became available to all Spectrum TV Select customers nationwide at no additional cost, with ESPN+ launched to Select Plus customers in March. ViX, a Spanish language DTC product, and regional sports DTC products, will also be available to customers at no extra cost within their respective packages.  \n We expect our hybrid DTC-linear model to be fully deployed next year. And we'll be able to deliver value for our customers and programming partners through fully bundled hybrid services, genre-based packages, selling DTC a la carte and potentially bundled DTC services to our broadband customers.  \n In late January, we launched our Spectrum TV Stream package, a 90-channel non-sports general entertainment package priced at $40 per month. TV Stream provides a compelling content offering at an attractive price from programmers like Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, Disney, Fox and A&E.  \n And so while the video business is clearly under pressure, we believe that flexible and attractively priced packaging options across all forms of video, channels really, integrated within a modern user interface in a more frictionless environment can recreate value in the ecosystem for our customers, programmers and distributors.  \n So when we step back, we clearly recognized some short-term market challenges, and we've embraced the opportunity to become an even better operator, leaving no stone unturned in our go-to-market and our efficiency initiatives. And in the meantime, we're growing a unique converged product at a rapid pace which can grow EBITDA through a competitive investment cycle. In long term, our network and customer demand products, pricing and packaging capabilities, our service infrastructure and the associated investments we're making today position Charter for sustainable growth and value creation.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jessica. Sure. Let me try to tackle those, and Jessica may want to chime in here as well. The first one is on ACP and what we estimate. John, the non-renewal of ACP, there's 23 million customers have it today. It's unfortunate. But it's certainly going to have a negative Internet customer growth impact for everyone, including us. And that's going to happen in what's already a seasonal Q2 and probably the third quarter as we work through likely non-pay activity. And so really, as you think about the extent of those losses, it's going to depend on a few things. \n One, first, being the stickiness of our retention offers. That includes us doing a free mobile line as well as for all ACP customers. That allows customers to save as much, if not more money on a monthly basis than the subsidy we already offered by ACP. In some cases, it can be much closer to EBB or maybe even more. \n And we do have a Spectrum Internet Assist. We have Internet 100. So we have products that we can move people to as needed. And so the second thing I would say is it's going to depend on how well we really execute on those retention tactics that matters. And then thirdly, the way that we manage what's going to be likely an elevated non-pay environment and really managing that to the best of our ability for the benefit of customers. \n In terms of specifics, this is an event that's unprecedented. In almost 30 years of cable, I haven't seen something like this before. So the short-term impact, it's difficult to predict. But in the end, I'm really confident we're going to manage through it successfully. It will be a onetime event, both on subscribers and maybe initial suppression of ARPU, but it's not going to impact our long-term growth potential. Yes. And so EBITDA, we're very confident on that. Giving a hard estimate on subscriber impact, for all the reasons I mentioned, is difficult. But we're going to outline that quarter by quarter. We'll have the ability to isolate. We'll provide that transparency for people along so they can see what's the underlying growth rate. \n Your other question, John, I want to make sure I understand, was on video churn. We rolled out -- at the beginning of the quarter, we rolled out the Disney+ to all Spectrum Select customers and above and to Select Plus customers, which is our more sports-oriented package on top. We rolled out ESPN+ in March. Very early on, good take-up on that product along the way. But there was nothing that was a rotation of our subscriber base inside there. So there was not a negative contributing factor to adding those in. \n I would highlight, in an environment where video these days really is coming in as an attach rate to Internet, we have lower Internet sales opportunities that has an impact on video. So the video churn rate stays relatively consistent. But the combination of having both lower selling opportunities for Internet and therefore lower attach rates for video, combined with the fact that we did do a programming cost increase pass-through inside of Q1 contributed to the video loss inside the quarter. \n I do think that as we add more bundling of these DTCs in a hybrid linear model over time, I think we have the ability to stem a lot of the churn and actually add back to both the gross addition side coming from potentially new calls coming in, but also higher attach rate to Internet primarily as we provide more value into the package, which offsets the significant programming cost increases that we've been forced to pass through. Does that answer where you're trying to get to? You've got a lower transaction environment, plus all the expense management activity that we're doing, and that will have significant impact to cost to serve as well as sales and marketing as well. \n And the broadband competition, maybe just take a step back and talk a little bit more detail about the operating environment and competitive and the results in that context. \n The first thing I think is important to just keep in mind is that our churn, it continues to be at or below historic lows, so very good. And bear with me, but we actually performed a little better in the first quarter in competitive switching versus last year. Which then somebody said, \"Well, wait a second, how does that work?\" \n And the real issue has been selling opportunities for broadband were actually much lower in the marketplace year-over-year, and that's driven by continued lower year-over-year move and household formation rates. There is some reversion to pre-pandemic mobile-only levels the past 2 quarters. \n And at the same time, as you mentioned, there's still some cell phone Internet expansion, and that's competing what is for a much lower opportunity set. So if you add to that, then just a bit of impact from the removal of ACP connects that started in early February, that's really what drove us to the loss of roughly 70,000 Internet. \n Ben, as you know, in this environment, small shifts in gross adds in particular, or even churn, which hasn't been the case, it just really has an outsized impact on net adds. And so that's going to definitely, as I mentioned before, it's going to be the case in the seasonal Q2, also with the end of ACP, all of which is temporary in nature. \n I think the bigger question is what are we doing? And as I mentioned, we still know, and I think everybody agrees, we have the best products. And we have it at the best all-in price, particularly when you're combining broadband and mobile, which is, in a lot of cases, what we're competing against. Our network evolution to symmetrical and multi-gig wireline and wireless capabilities, and we're doing that at a low cost of $100 per passing. And then as I mentioned, we have the expansion of that best-in-class network and converged products to homes with no broadband today. \n So in essence, what we're doing is we're still very competitive saving customers lots of money with fastest products. And we do that with a 100% in-house onshore service structure. And when you put that together with what I mentioned in the prepared remarks is continued increasing customer demand for data, it means we're very well positioned to return to sustainable growth over time. \n And the key for us really is, in the meantime, we're heads down on execution. It doesn't mean that we don't have short-term opportunities. We're leaving no stone unturned on go-to-market. We have great assets and ability to package and price in I think ways that are new and innovative. \n And what we're trying to do in the meantime as well, you mentioned on wireline overbuild in particular, still be very disciplined around the pricing because we know the value of our products. And so we saw a few overbuilders go a little bit downstream during the quarter. And we've resisted the temptation to go there just because we know the value of our both wireline and wireless services and the value that we can bring to customers long term. I would just add on -- just to add, Jessica said it, 0 lack of confidence. We have good, strong free cash flow today, have even growing free cash flow, and much more so as we get through these onetime investments. It's really -- as Jessica has already said, it's about making sure that we ensure the investment-grade structure we have. And that's important to us, it's important to our debt holders, and it's important to our equity holders as well. And so I'd put that one to being responsive, and at the same time, given the current stock price, we want to do as much as we can within that responsiveness. So Craig, I'll start on the first one on convergence. And I think the best way to do this is I spend a lot of time internally talking about it as well, is if I asked you 15 years ago, what's the speed of your Internet connection? You would have connected to the back of the computer in your kitchen, and that would have been it. And 10 years ago, it might have been, here it is on WiFi on my couch or out on the terrace. \n And today, if you're pulling out of the driveway and driving out and I say, \"Who's your Internet provider right now?\" You'd say, \"I don't know, I don't care. It just has to work and it has to be fast.\" And if that's people's definition increasingly of what's broadband connectivity, then we're the only provider in our footprint that can provide that uniform, ubiquitous broadband Internet in a seamless connectivity way. \n And so we have the Internet. We have the WiFi. Our 5G cellular is a backup service when Internet and WiFi isn't available. And over -- last we reported, it was 87% of our traffic was going over our WiFi and increasingly with CBRS.\n So 5G, interestingly, it's the backup radio. It's the slowest portion of our network. And when you put that all together in a way that I think we're uniquely capable of doing, we have the ability to offer something in the marketplace. \n Now the challenge is that's not the way that it's been sold. It's not the way that customers think about it explicitly today in terms of how they purchase service. So there's an education challenge that's there in the way that we package, price and market that along the way. We'll have a meaningful impact. \n Another way of thinking about it is that mobile today, and in fact I would argue, always has been, is just an extension of an Internet connection. And is it really a product? Is mobile a product? Or is it just an extension? Because even in 15 years ago, it's really a wireline service going to a tower, and that was just extending the broadband connection. And today, we're doing that from WiFi inside the home, out on strand. And we have the ability to provide that service in a ubiquitous way that is competitive. \n And so Spectrum One, the idea is how do you educate the market and try to get the purchase habits to change in a different way. And over time, is mobile really a product? And testing and pushing the limits in the market, I think we have something here that's a competitive advantage, and it just may take a little bit of time to fully flesh its way out. \n But we are that service provider today, not only to ourselves, but we're actually providing that backhaul service to foreign cellular devices on our WiFi routers today. And we are the backhaul and the backbone of almost all cellular traffic. So it just puts a unique opportunity for us to capitalize on that in the future. And the piece of that, the piece that's pulling that is really cell tower backhaul... Right. So the traditional wholesale is relatively steady, and it's the cell tower backhaul that's in systemic decline, if you will. Bryan, on the net neutrality, I'd start from the get go. We don't -- the key concern isn't net neutrality. The concern is the Title II regime. We've -- we don't block. We don't do paid prioritization. We don't throttle, and we don't even have data caps. We believe that customers should have unlimited usage of the service that they're paying for. \n The question has really been around Title II and what that brings, things around forbearance on rate regulation, the additional unintended consequences of where that can lead to on regulation for a product that, without regulation, is that type of regulation has been very successful to delivering tremendous value for consumers over a couple of decades now. \n I would say that where we're at in the Title II debate with the FCC, there's 0 surprise. It's exactly where everybody thought we would be, and we're going to continue to go through that process. Unfortunately, it seems like over many years as this kind of works its way probably back to a court at this stage. And then hopefully, over time, we can get a standard set by Congress that puts this to bed once and for all. That's always been the hope. But I don't think Title II is the right way to regulate the things that we're already doing well. Or in it, in most cases. And if you think about it just from a customer perspective and how we were trying to be responsive to the government request, we wanted to make sure that these customers entering into collection cycle on video or phone didn't somehow suppress their ability to continue to receive the ACP benefit and continue to receive connectivity. And it's -- that's a classic example of the base of customers that we're going to work through, as I talked about from a collection cycle. And do the right thing for those customers to do everything we can to make sure that they stay connected to Internet over time. But there's challenges there. We'll go through the month of May with a partial ACP in accordance with what the government outlined. It's going to be a partial credit of $14, and we've agreed to make it $15 just to round it and make it clear to -- and fair to customers. So that's what we'll do inside of May. So on the first question, the connection was a little off, and so we're going to sell you a Spectrum Mobile after this call here. \n But the -- so I'm going to want to take the liberty of answering the question I think you asked. Look, we don't get into detail on individual programming renewals, and we've been generally very successful at getting renewals throughout the years. That's always our goal. \n Our goal, though, is to really make sure that, first and foremost, that we really change the model so that we, once again, create value for customers. That starts with not asking them to pay twice for the same product, which is the debate that we've had historically and where we set a new model. \n But it also means approaching the marketplace in all of our deal renewals and saying, \"Look, we've got to fight for the customer.\" And if they have a path to get a product that's equivalent or in some cases, even better for a lower price, we should just be selling that product, and that's the way that we should go to market. \n And we can have that ability to do traditional linear hybrid. We can sell DTCs. We can sell them in a bundle. We have 25,000 in-house sales representatives in sales and retention. And so we have a workforce that's very capable of being a distribution engine for linear hybrid, DTC. And we have a large base of broadband customers, none surpassing us, that we can use that's unique. And we want to do that in a way that creates value for consumers. \n I think as we've approached the marketplace in what is a different way, it creates consternation because it's something very different. But our goal here is really to create a video ecosystem that works for customers and providing utility and value. Again, utility through Xumo and value through our ability to package in different ways that meets the customers' needs at a fair price. And ultimately, while it may be painful along the way, actually creates value again for programmers and distributors and recreates a video ecosystem that works for everybody. \n And so we're not approaching this from a way of just trying to save money. We're just trying to actually create value for customers by either adding more product so that the price they pay is worth it or saving them money because they wanted to package anyway. And we can do that in a way in a lower churn environment for the benefit of programmers, and that just takes a little bit to get through. \n But our goals here are really to recreate a video ecosystem that works for everybody. Today, it doesn't. It's been broken, and it's been broken for a while. And I think that we had the first time in maybe 2 decades where we can do something where we have a product that we're proud to put on our Internet bill at some point soon. \n And that really is, when we talked about it last year, is the balance of, on one hand, our bundled customers churn less. And so a high-quality video product has always been an asset. But when the rate continues to go up and the value goes down and it's being sold around customers and ask them to pay twice, then it becomes a liability on the Internet broadband bill. And then I think we need to rethink the way that what we're selling for video and how it actually creates value for customers or not. \n So that's where we've been. And I'm confident we're going to continue to make progress in this space. So I'm not going to provide a detailed timeline for the timing to reaccelerate, just because I want to be conservative and recognize that it's a very fluid space. I mean, clearly, we have ACP going on right now, which is going to be a onetime hit. You have cell phone Internet where they will reach capacity, and the timing of that isn't entirely clear. And then there's fiber upgrades, which have been announced and are pretty far along from what was actually announced. \n So I think if you put that all together, though, and flip it and say, well, get past ACP, and the pace of fiber upgrades is relatively stable, and I think over time should actually start to decline. Cell phone Internet will run out of capacity, and you're already starting to see some signs of some of that paring back, all of which bodes well. \n And then you combine that with the fact that when you look at our -- the quality of our Internet product, in 100% of the market, particularly and even more so in those that don't have a gig overlap, which is about half. And then you combine that with the unique ability to provide a very attractively priced mobile product that's actually the fastest mobile product in the business simply because it largely rides on our gigabit wireless infrastructure, we have a structural advantage for now and many years to come, not only just on quality, but the ability to save customers hundreds and even thousands of dollars. \n And so I sit back and look at that and say, it isn't a question of if. It's just a question of when. And as some of these short-term pressures pare back, that's when you'll start to see it turn. \n Honestly, we haven't been the best at predicting the exact timing of that. And so I said last quarter, we owned that. And so I want to be careful that I'm not overextending ourselves here either. But I think it's more important just to take a step back and look at what is the product we have, what's the network capabilities we have. It's only getting better. \n If you then tack on to that the rural passings, that you mentioned ex rural, so I did that ex rural. But if you add on to that the subsidized rural passings where it's just math in terms of the penetration, the net additions that we're going to get on the back of that investment, I still think the future's very, very bright for Charter. Good. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. And look forward to talking to you again on the next one."

            "name": "Jessica Fischer",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's turn to customer results on Slide 5. Including residential and SMB, we lost 72,000 Internet customers in the first quarter, and video customers declined by 405,000. In mobile, we added 486,000 mobile lines. And wireline voice customers declined by 279,000. Our mobile product continued to perform well. And although we saw lower mobile gross adds year-over-year tied to lower gross Internet additions, we also saw lower overall mobile churn rate year-over-year and sequentially.  \n Customers who signed up for our Spectrum One product in the first quarter of 2023 reached their 12-month anniversary this past quarter. Similar to last quarter, those promotional roll-offs did not drive incremental Internet churn. In fact, our Internet churn rate also declined year-over-year. So as we always expected, Spectrum One lines are performing well, and our converged offering drives higher mobile sales and longer customer lifetimes.  \n Turning to rural. We ended the quarter with 493,000 subsidized rural passings. And we grew those passings by 324,000 over the last 12 months and 73,000 in the first quarter. It's a bit of a slowdown from Q4, as we noted it would be on our last call, given winter construction seasonality. Penetration growth continues to exceed our expectations, and customer growth in our subsidized rural footprint increased with 35,000 net customer additions in the quarter. We continue to expect to activate approximately 450,000 new subsidized rural passings in 2024, about 50% more than in 2023. \n We also continue to expect our RDOF build to be completed by the end of 2026, 2 years ahead of schedule. The RDOF and ARPA program rules have been successful in driving large-scale private capital builds. With respect to BEAD, most of the state's rules are still working through the NTIA review process. We expect some states will have a regulatory environment conducive to private investment while others will not. And we'll be disciplined in our investment approach with the continued expectation that some opportunities with appropriate ROIs will be available.  \n Before turning to our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments regarding the Affordable Connectivity Program. An ACP renewal now appears unlikely for the program's 23 million recipients nationwide and for our 5.0 million Internet customers receiving a subsidy. We will do everything we can to preserve our relationship with the ACP subsidy recipients, and we expect to keep the vast majority of them as customers. We have a number of ways to assist those that may lose their ACP subsidy, including our Spectrum Internet Assist program and Internet 100 product. We're also offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for 1 year.  \n The success of our Spectrum One offering has shown that we can create long-term converged connectivity customers by saving consumers hundreds or even thousands of dollars on their mobile bill. And even after the initial promotional period ends, we will still be able to save these customers the equivalent or more than the $30 ACP subsidy benefit that they are currently receiving.  \n The majority of ACP recipients in our customer base were Internet customers before the start of the ACP program. And the vast majority of our ACP customers also pay something out of pocket for their Internet service. Ultimately, we will lose some customers, and our Internet ARPU and bad debt expense may have onetime pressure, but we expect the impact to Charter to be mostly limited to the second and third quarters of this year. And we will provide transparency for those impacts in our quarterly reporting.  \n Moving to the first quarter financial results, starting on Slide 6. Over the last year, residential customers declined by 0.7%, driven by video-only customer churn. Residential revenue per customer relationship declined 0.1% over-year, given a higher mix of non-video customers and growth of lower-priced video packages within our base, mostly offset by promotional rate step-ups, rate adjustments and the growth of Spectrum Mobile. As Slide 6 shows, in total, residential revenue declined by 0.4% year-over-year.  \n Turning to commercial. SMB revenue declined by 0.3% year-over-year, reflecting lower monthly SMB revenue per SMB customer primarily due to a higher mix of lower-priced video packages and a lower number of voice lines per SMB customer. These factors were slightly offset by SMB customer growth of 0.2% year-over-year.  \n Enterprise revenue grew 3.8% year-over-year driven by enterprise PSU growth of 6.9% year-over-year. Excluding all wholesale revenue, enterprise revenue grew by 5.5%.  \n First quarter advertising revenue grew by 10% year-over-year given political revenue growth. And core ad revenue was essentially flat year-over-year. \n Other revenue grew by 2.4% year-over-year primarily driven by higher mobile device sales. And in total, consolidated first quarter revenue was up 0.2% year-over-year and down 0.1% year-over-year when excluding advertising. \n Moving to operating expenses and adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. In the first quarter, total operating expenses declined by 1.5% year-over-year. Programming costs declined by 8.2% year-over-year due to the decline in video customers of 8% year-over-year and a higher mix of lighter video packages. These factors were partly offset by higher programming rates. And first quarter 2024 programming costs include around $30 million of favorable adjustments versus $50 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year period. \n Other cost of revenue increased by 9.8% primarily driven by mobile service direct costs and higher mobile device sales. Cost to serve customers were essentially flat year-over-year with additional activity to support the growth of Spectrum Mobile and higher bad debt expense, mostly offset by lower service transactions per customers, including productivity from 10-year investments. Sales and marketing costs declined by 2.7% primarily driven by lower labor costs, partly tied to lower connect volume. Finally, other expense grew by 0.5%. \n Adjusted EBITDA grew by 2.8% year-over-year in the quarter. And when excluding advertising, EBITDA grew by 2.2% year-over-year. Looking ahead, our goal is to deliver solid EBITDA growth, and we believe we can do that even as we make significant investments in the business, face a challenging competitive environment and reach the likely end of the ACP program. \n Our residential revenue will be supported by Internet ARPU growth and our growing mobile customer base. In addition, mobile's contribution to EBITDA continues to improve as the business scales. We've also lapped the significant investments that we made in our employee base, so the related EBITDA drag should be mostly behind us. \n And finally, we continue to carefully manage our expenses across the business. And while we're not going to do anything that would impact our sales or service capabilities, this quarter's cost to service customers and sales and marketing expense results demonstrate our ability to drive efficiencies into the business. \n In the second quarter, we will face some tough expense comparisons, particularly in other expense as well as ACP headwinds. So while our second quarter EBITDA growth will be muted, our expense management process is clearly working. And financial growth in the back half of the year should accelerate given our expense management initiatives, Spectrum One promotional roll-off and political advertising revenue. \n Turning to net income on Slide 8. We generated $1.1 billion of net income attributable to Charter shareholders in the first quarter, up from $1 billion last year, driven by higher adjusted EBITDA and a gain on the sale of towers, partly offset by higher income tax and interest expenses. \n Turning to Slide 9. Capital expenditures totaled $2.8 billion in the first quarter, about $325 million above last year's first quarter spend. Line extensions totaled $1 billion, $69 million higher than last year driven by our subsidized rural construction initiative and increased residential and commercial greenfield and market fill-in opportunities. \n First quarter capital expenditures, excluding line extensions, totaled $1.8 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the first quarter of 2023 driven by higher spend on upgrade, rebuild, primarily network evolution, and higher CPE spend due to purchases of Xumo Stream boxes. For the full year 2024, we continue to expect capital expenditures to total between $12.2 billion and $12.4 billion, including line extension spend of approximately $4.5 billion and network evolution spend of approximately $1.6 billion. \n Turning to free cash flow on Slide 10. The cash flow in the first quarter totaled $358 million, a decrease of approximately $300 million compared to last year. The decline was primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures and a onetime settlement payment in the first quarter of 2024, partly offset by a less unfavorable change in working capital year-over-year and higher adjusted EBITDA. \n We finished the quarter with $97.8 billion in debt principal. Our current run rate annualized cash interest is $5.2 billion. Given our long-dated and 85% fixed rate debt structure, our sensitivity to higher rates is relatively low. If we refinanced all of our debt due in 2025 and 2026 at current rates, the impact to our run rate interest expense would be less than $140 million. \n As of the end of the first quarter, our ratio of net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA was 4.41x, which is lower sequentially and year-over-year. We expect to continue that trend, moving closer to the middle of our 4 to 4.5x target leverage range through the end of this year. \n We remain fully committed to maintaining our split-rated debt structure, including access to the investment-grade market given the significant benefits it offers to all of our providers of capital. And we continue to be confident in the long-term trajectory of the business. We believe that our levered equity strategy, including share buybacks, combined with the investments that we are making in the business, will drive value going forward. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million Charter shares and Charter Holdings common units totaling $567 million at an average price of $339 per share. \n With the continued temporary impact from cell phone Internet competition and the potential headwind from the end of ACP, we will continue to face short-term customer growth headwinds. Despite these short-term challenges, we are competing well. We have a very attractively structured balance sheet, and we're focused on driving healthy EBITDA growth in 2024 through a short-term competitive and investment cycle. So we're well positioned today and for continued future growth. \n With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Yes. As you think about EBITDA across the year, as we pointed out and I would just highlight it, there are some pressures on EBITDA in Q2 because of the comps to last year as well as likely, if there is non-pay impact, there could be some bad debt pressure inside of Q2 as well. So I would expect our EBITDA growth to be more pressured in Q2. \n But we see the ability for it to accelerate across the rest of the year when you consider the roll-off of Spectrum Mobile, political advertising and our continued expense initiatives in the business as well. And so because of that, in all of the scenarios that we've looked at, we continue to expect EBITDA growth in the year. So Ben, on the line item expense guidance that we gave earlier in the year, I don't have an update to any of those specific items. But what I would tell you is that, because of some of the work that we're doing around expenses across the business, I think it's possible that we come in lower than what we guided to, to begin with. I don't have a revision, but I think it's possible we come in on the low side. So that's a fair call out. The exact amount of the bad debt related to ACP is hard to predict because it's a matter of what the mix is between customers that go non-pay and customers that sort of contact you in some other way. So that's fair call out. \n On items other than that, I think the possibility is that we do better. Yes. So Jonathan, I would say our confidence in the business hasn't changed. We remain comfortable with our 4 to 4.5x range based on the outlook that we have. But I think being sort of at the height of the investment cycle, we thought that creating a little bit of headroom was appropriate. \n We constantly reevaluate our position. We'll continue to do that. But we continue to believe in the long-term trajectory of the business. We think the investments that we're making will deliver strong returns. And we know that maintaining the levered equity strategy, including sort of buybacks and leverage levels overall, is important to continuing to drive value. Jonathan, we're in regular contact with all 3 of the ratings agencies. Certainly, I think that there has been some additional conversation across debt holders and the rating agencies, given the higher CapEx that we have in the business and the sort of short-term pressure that, that puts on free cash flow. \n And given sort of the tone of the broader market, you might have seen S&P issued a tearsheet at the end of last week that addressed ACP and the competitive environment. And I think their concerns are similar to those of equity holders, though they noted in there that they don't expect our ratings to change even though they might adjust their triggers somewhat. And even if our corporate family ratings were to change, they didn't expect any impact to the investment-grade rating. \n So we constantly communicate with them. I think that given where we are, it made sense for us to create a little bit of headroom. As I said, we constantly reevaluate. It's certainly possible that we could move back up in the range at some point in time, particularly as you think about sort of free cash flow growth coming back as the investments winds down. Yes. Craig, on the other side, wholesale is a little less than 20% of overall enterprise revenues. Yes, and that's really a little less than half of that piece. Yes. So Bryan, the onetime payment that impacted free cash flow on the order of $150 million to $180 million, in that range. And then from a working capital perspective, Q1 is always for us a negative working capital quarter. And I fully expect that we'll sort of make back to close to flat over the course of the year the negative working capital that we had. Excluding working capital, excluding the mobile device or the mobile side in the first quarter. Obviously, mobile continues to be a drag on working capital because of the device sales, and so you should expect that piece to continue. Yes. So starting on the first one on the Internet ARPU. The Spectrum One allocation was 70 basis points of drag year-over-year on our net ARPU growth in the quarter. So the GAAP Internet ARPU increased by 1.7%. It would have been 2.4% excluding the mobile allocation for free lines. Generally, I would expect that the gap in those 2 growth rates should narrow over the course of the year because the base of free lines becomes more stable given promotional roll-off. \n However, I talked about that we are offering all of our ACP customers a free mobile line for a year. And depending on the level of success of that program, if we did see a reacceleration in the number of free lines, the gap between those 2 things could widen again. \n Talking about what you see inside of the footnote and the aging. So we have had a process over time where we save customers into ACP. So if there was a customer who took multiple lines of business, say they were an Internet and video customer, and they were paying us. And then went into a non-pay status but they were eligible for ACP. Or already in ACP. What we would do would be to downgrade the customer to an Internet-only product that was fully covered by the ACP subsidy, which enabled them to continue their Internet service. But then they would no longer have whatever the additional services were that were on their accounts. We have held those balances, though they're fully reserved. So they're sitting in receivables, but they're also sort of fully written off already in the bad debt reserve process. \n But you're correct that numerically inside of the footnote, then you can see the base of customers who at some point in the past went into a non-pay process but have had their bill fully subsidized by ACP for some period of time. On the buyback authorization side. I'm going to make sure we answer that question. The authorization as of the end of the quarter, as you pointed out, is a little bit lower than what you would typically see. There are multiple mechanisms by which that gets renewed, and we have increased the buyback authorization since that point in time. And just because of the readthrough to that, I want to be really clear that we expect to be able to maintain our buybacks over the course of the year even as we delever. So you should not read that through as any sort of sign about the direction of the program. On the mobile working capital side, so you point out, without a doubt, the drag on working capital is driven by the number of phones or other mobile devices that you sell subject to EIP notes. And so if we were to end up with additional devices because of having additional mobile customers as a result of our work on ACP or if we end up with some additional devices because of the Anytime Upgrade program, which is also possible, there could be some acceleration in that drag. \n What I would tell you on the other side of that is, as we've been building our mobile business, we haven't taken advantage of some of the financing options that are available for us related to having those EIP notes as part of our overall asset stack. And it hasn't yet made sense for a wide variety of reasons, including just sort of building the scale for a program like that to make sense. \n So I think it's also possible that we could offset some of that drag in working capital by working through some of those financing mechanisms. And certainly, as we've been building, I think we're reaching a size at which that becomes a more viable option."
